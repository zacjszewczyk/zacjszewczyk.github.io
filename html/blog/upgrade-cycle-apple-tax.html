<p>I have written about this before, in an article titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/testing-the-apple-tax.html"><em>Testing the Apple Tax</em></a>, and Ben Lovejoy comes to the same conclusion I did in his piece over at 9to5 Mac: in reality, the proposed &#8220;Apple tax&#8221; is, frankly, nearly nonexistent. Taking into account overall build quality, form factor, fit and finish, power, and power consumption, Mac computers compete quite competitively with their PC &#8220;counterparts&#8221;; adding in other factors such as resale value, maintenance, and support, I have a hard time believing anyone could make the reasonable case than any manufacturer offers greater value than Apple.
