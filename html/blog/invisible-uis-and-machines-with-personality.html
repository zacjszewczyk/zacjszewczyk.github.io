<p>At first I glossed over Timo Arnall&#8217;s piece <a href="http://www.elasticspace.com/2013/03/no-to-no-ui"><em>No to NoUI</em></a>, finding little interest in a discussion of user interfaces and its proponents&#8217; nuances. After a steady climb towards the top spot on Hacker News though I added it to Instapaper, as I am wont to do for articles attracting this level of attention regardless of the topic. Rather than a meandering or pragmatic discussion regarding design in the most touchy-feely manner possible, though, I found, to my surprise, an interesting piece discussing the far-reaching and unobvious effects user interfaces have on our every day lives and the detrimental effects a future in which the user interface is invisible would bring&#160;&#8212;&#160;a discussion that also encompassed the importance of good design. A very interesting piece well worth the read, even if you have no interest in design.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;We already have plenty of thinking that celebrates the invisibility and seamlessness of technology. We are overloaded with childish mythologies like &#8216;the cloud&#8217;; a soft, fuzzy metaphor for enormous infrastructural projects of undersea cables and power-hungry data farms. This mythology can be harmful and is often just plain wrong. Networks go down, hard disks fail, sensors fail to sense, processors overheat and batteries die.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also of great interest to me was the piece referenced in passing at the beginning of Timo Arnall&#8217;s second section explaining how naturality is often used as an excuse for the absence of design, the <a href="http://journal.benbashford.com/post/2848763029">article by Ben Bashford on giving technology personality and behavior</a> and how such a step would change the paradigm. Although posted more than two years ago, Ben&#8217;s article is no less applicable or interesting today than it undoubtedly was when he originally published the piece.</p>
