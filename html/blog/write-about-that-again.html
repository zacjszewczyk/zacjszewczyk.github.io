<p>For the past week or so, I&#8217;ve been on a bit of a writing binge. With school finally done for the summer, I suddenly found myself with a lot of free time I quickly filled with writing at every possible moment. I started and finished <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeons-experiment.html"><em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em></a> over the first six days, and wrote a number of much smaller articles and link posts since then. All in all, it&#8217;s been a great few days.</p>

<p>In times like this, when I write and write almost constantly, I often touch on new topics very briefly or revisit the subjects of past posts, often a result of only writing a brief article on said topic the first time around. Regardless of the reason though, it&#8217;s not uncommon for me to revisit a topic I wrote about in the past. I used to worry about sounding repetitive and boring, then I listened to a recent episode of Back to Work where Merlin Mann said, in passing while talking about Inbox Zero, something along the lines of, &#8220;It&#8217;s a little self-involved to think that everyone is familiar with all your work, and that just because you wrote something a year ago that they have seen it.&#8221; As usual, it was not until long after I heard these words that I realized how impactful they really are.</p>
