I intended to spend a lot of this time catching up on some reading, writing, coding, and working on a new project, but unfortunately as of yet that hasn't happened. During what relatively little reading I did do over the three days since Christmas Break started though, I've noticed that I'm not the only one to step back, take a bit of a break from working, and relax. And you know what? That's just fine: you don't have to spend every day working, nor are you required to make up for lost time over holidays. You will still be successful if you take a bit of a break.

<p>Since starting Christmas Break a few days ago I&#8217;ve had a lot of time on my hands. I intended to spend a lot of this time catching up on some reading, writing, coding, and working on a new project, but unfortunately as of yet that hasn&#8217;t happened. During what relatively little reading I did do over the three days since Christmas Break started though, I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m not the only one to step back, take a bit of a break from working, and relax. And you know what? That&#8217;s just fine: you don&#8217;t have to spend every day working, nor are you required to make up for lost time over holidays. You will still be successful if you take a bit of a break. It&#8217;s Christmas; go relax on the couch, eat some cookies, and gain a few pounds.</p>
