<p>After last month&#8217;s post, I feared for the future viability of this series as I continued an apparent trend of finding fewer and fewer cool links for each of these issues. After the last few weeks, however, I&#8217;m convinced that those slow months were flukes: this time around, boy have I got some great cabins to show you. Let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://tiny-project.com">The Tiny Project</a>, then, a small house built on a trailer that features beautiful architecture and well thought-out design. Very impressive&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would be more than happy to live in one of these, traveling around the country with the comfort of home just a few feet from my steering wheel. Maybe some day.</p>

<p>The folks over at Beaver Brook, the ones who run Cabin Porn, are publishing a book. I linked to the page <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-the-book.html">earlier this month</a>, but if you haven&#8217;t signed up for the waiting list, go ahead and put your email in there now: it will be money well-spent, of that I am sure. I can&#8217;t wait to put this one on my shelf.</p>

<p>Speaking of Beaver Brook, I just discovered their tumblr. If you enjoy Cabin Porn and want to see other, similar pictures that never see the light of day on CabinPorn.com, check the parent site out. <a href="http://beaverbrook.com">Beaver Brook</a>.</p>

<p>Although lacking in the rustic aesthetic I love so much about the majority of cabins I link to here, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80001115355/handcrafted-chestnut-yurt-built-by-guy-mallinson">this handcrafted chestnut yurt</a> in England definitely deserves a link. How cool&#160;&#8212;&#160;I could definitely spend a few days living in this; and to build one? Sign me up.</p>

<p>Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by mountains. Although the &#8220;mountains&#8221; I have climbed in the past could have been more accurately described as very large hills shooting no more than one or two hundred feet into the air, the allure was no different than the larger ones I see pictures of across the world. Take the Swiss Alps, for example, and <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/the-solvay-hut">the Solvay emergency hut</a> located partway up the cliff face: the perfect combination of my two favorite things in the world.</p>

<p>Mike Belleme doesn&#8217;t have a treehouse, he has <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80257859712/photographer-mike-bellemes-treehome-outside">a <em>treehome</em> outside Asheville, North Carolina</a>, and it&#8217;s awesome. I have not spent long in North Carolina, but even from what little time I have spent there I could tell that it would be a great place to live, and doubly so in a house like this.</p>

<p>Back in December of last year, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5967622/the-tiny-transforming-apartment-that-packs-six-rooms-into-350-square-feet">Gizmodo linked to a sweet transforming apartment in New York</a>; Uncrate just picked the link up <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/transforming-micro-apartment/">last week</a>, and it&#8217;s just as awesome now as it was back then.</p>

<p>Cool cabins aren&#8217;t just an American phenomenon, nor something restricted to Europe and its surrounding countries. This quaint <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80357875000/elevated-farmers-cabin-on-the-island-of-flores">farmer&#8217;s cabin in Indonesia</a> proves it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I would call <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80464622315/rangiwahia-hut-at-1300-metres-in-the-ruahine">this one</a> a hut, but I won&#8217;t dispute its elevation of 1300 meters. If only those clouds weren&#8217;t there, I have no doubt that would be an incredible view.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80574402457/tilly-jane-cabin-in-the-mt-hood-national">this cabin in the Mt. Hood National Park in Oregon</a>. I have always wanted to travel to Oregon, and to know that I could spend a week in a cabin like this... Count me in.</p>

<p>Follow-up from my Cabin Porn Roundup post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-114.html">two months ago in January</a>, where I originally linked to this stone cabin in Linesco, Switzerland, Huckberry takes a more in-depth look at it in their article <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/shelter-hidden-cabin"><em>Shelter: Hidden Cabin</em></a>. I still can&#8217;t say that I love thee cold, modern, and impersonal interior, but it&#8217;s still pretty cool.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80676271401/rick-lee-has-been-building-a-small-off-grid-cabin">Cabin Porn&#8217;s link</a>, &#8220;Rick Lee has been building a small off-grid cabin in Arkansas with his young sons, using only materials they can carry in by hand.&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty awesome. Also, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesrleejr/sets/72157628691595507/">Rick&#8217;s Flickr page</a> where you can see tons of pictures taken throughout the process. Neat.</p>

<p>I would happily spend some time in <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80775453179/small-cabin-near-temenos-massachusetts">this small cabin in Massachusetts</a>. Looks like the perfect getaway to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;disconnected from the outside world, and just far enough removed from everything else to really get away from it all.</p>

<p>These <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/wheelhaus-mobile-cabins/">Wheelhaus Mobile Cabins</a> are incredible. I have always wanted a mobile home or camper that I could attach to the back of a large truck and just <em>go</em>, and these just sweeten the deal. Awesome.</p>

<p>How&#8217;s <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80847672649/charles-inglis-clark-memorial-hut-ben-nevis">this</a> for a bit of perspective?</p>

<p>Now <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80876956857/huts-by-patrick-bouchain-and-alexandre-gauthier">these huts near Montreuil, France</a>, are just cool, and I love the idea of covering the outside with grasses. These look sort of like something I would have built over a weekend camping trip; I&#8217;d bet they&#8217;re a bit more accommodating than anything I could throw together though.</p>

<p>Man has it been a good month.</p>
