<p>After finishing the backlog of Critical Path episodes early yesterday afternoon, I scrolled down through <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/too-many-podcasts.html">my extensive list of podcasts</a> until I came to <em>The Talk Show With John Gruber</em>. After <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/regarding-the-talk-show.html">my initial impressions</a> of John Gruber&#8217;s latest work, I did not expect to particularly enjoy the next hour and a half. Like my previous encounters with John Gruber&#8217;s work, however, where it took a number of tries to discover the value of The Talk Show while it aired in 5by5, the third time was the charm: I am once again hooked on John&#8217;s podcast.
