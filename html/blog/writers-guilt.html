<p>Some days, I want to write. Other days, I don&#8217;t. Today is one of the latter, and yet I still wrote this. Why?</p>

<p>I tried over and over, time and time again to write today. With the school year coming to a close and exams beginning next week, I have an inordinate amount of free time on my hands, time that I wanted to fill writing. All I have to show for my efforts though is a blank screen, a blinking cursor, and more guilt than I know what to do with.</p>

<p>Some days, inspiration drives me to write. Other days, I get caught in the heat of the moment and can&#8217;t help but write about the most popular news story. More often than not though, maddeningly often, it&#8217;s not inspiration or competition that pushes me to shut everything out and write for a while, but a crushing feeling of guilt. Guilt that I haven&#8217;t written anything for one, two, or three days; guilt that I spent my time not writing. This isn&#8217;t at all unusual; I do it almost every week. Just as Monday comes back around every  seven days, so does this stupid cycle, and I hate it. I do it partly out of fear, reasoning that if I don&#8217;t write or at least post something every day, the small readership I do have will disappear. The other part of it though, by far the lion&#8217;s share, comes from this arbitrary quota I force upon myself. I have a blog, after all; it follows that it is my prerogative, as the owner of that site, to write and to write often.</p>

<p>But you know what? I&#8217;ll write on the days I&#8217;ll write, and I won&#8217;t on the days I won&#8217;t. Today is the last day I let guilt drive me to write, lost readership or not. Here&#8217;s to not writing and not feeling guilty about it. Cheers.</p>
