<p>I often <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-mornings-reads.html">see articles</a> that I would like to talk about, but that I do not feel warrant a whole post here. Twitter is the obvious choice for quips like these, but I have little love for the service, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">prefer</a> to keep all my work <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-own-your-platform.html">on my own platform</a>, and feel that nuanced opinions should not come in 280 character bursts. Occasional &#8220;lightning rounds&#8221; will fill that gap. Together, a handful of these micro posts will make a full one, giving me somewhere to share things that used to just slip through the cracks.</p>

    <li><a href="https://qz.com/1759474/only-9-percent-of-15-year-olds-can-distinguish-between-fact-and-opinion/">Only 9% of 15-year-olds can tell the difference between fact and opinion</a>. Does the responsibility for differentiating between fact and opinion fall on the reader, or the one presenting the information? In the era of fake news, amidst a resurgence of propaganda, you may feel tempted to say it falls on the reader. Consider this, though: if I present false information as fact to you here, you cannot know it&#8217;s falsehood <em>without doing your own, independent research</em>. The responsibility for differentiating between fact and opinion, then, falls on the presenter&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the reader, who has no way of knowing truth from fiction by default, has a responsibility to <em>verify</em> the presenter&#8217;s claims. This is a nuanced distinction, but an important one.</li>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3523237-zuckerberg-doubles-down-on-ad-policy">Zuckerberg doubles down on ad policy</a>. From Seeking Alpha, quoting Mark Zuckerberg: &#8220;&#8216;What I believe is that in a democracy, it&#8217;s really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying, so they can make their own judgments,&#8217; he said. &#8216;And, you know, I don&#8217;t think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news.&#8217;&#8221; Facebook commands an unprecedented majority of the world&#8217;s time and attention. As a result, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-internet-and-the-third-estate.html">it may very well lead to the Second Estate&#8217;s overthrow</a>. The idea that it should <em>also</em> become the arbiter of truth boggles my mind. See above. </li>
<li><a href="https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.6">En-ROADS Interactive Climate Simulator</a>. I would have more interest in a simulator that modeled temperature change based on the behavior of individual countries. See related: <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/us-emissions-have-no-effect-on-temperatures.html">U.S. Emissions Have Almost No Effect on Global Temperatures</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/kill-sticky-headers/">Kill Sticky Headers</a>. I dislike anything that gets in the way of content. So does Alisdair McDiarmid, and so he did something about it.</li>
