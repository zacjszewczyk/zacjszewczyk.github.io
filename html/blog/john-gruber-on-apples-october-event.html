<p>I realize I have come late to the party, but after just two weeks that does not change the relevancy of John Gruber&#8217;s article written in the wake of Apple&#8217;s October iPad event. Many wrote about a single aspect: Marco <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/24/off">chimed in on the presentation itself</a>, and I devoted an entire article to the notion of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-ipad-pro.html">an upcoming iPad Pro</a>; others, <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/10/22/thoughts-on-the-apple-event/">such as Jim Dalrymple</a>, attempted the more monumental task of tackling the entire event; still others put forth more opinion-based pieces, such as Shawn Blanc&#8217;s <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/10/best-in-class-built-to-last/"><em>Best in Class, Built to Last</em></a>. None, however, did such a good job as John in not only conveying his thoughts and observations regarding the event, but presenting both those ideas and Apple&#8217;s announcements in context born from years of experience in this industry.</p>

<p>This is why John Gruber is so famous amongst the generation of writers, and why so many respect him; this is why I read Daring Fireball, for these impressively insightful pieces that inspire me to become a better writer myself. John gives me a bar to strive for, and one that I someday hope to reach.</p>
