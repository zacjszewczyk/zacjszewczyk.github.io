<p>I have devoted a lot of time to thinking about this, curious as to my motivations behind writing. In the past I said I wrote because I wanted to share my knowledge with others. How noble of me, I suppose. At other times, simply because I love the writer&#8217;s craft. This was closer to the real reason, but neither, while true on some level, accurately represented the actual drive that has pushed me to come home after a long day and sit down to write rather than collapse in my bed, the motivation necessary to make that seven-to-eleven-o&#8217;clock&#160;&#8212;&#160;or ten-to-midnight, as is the case here&#160;&#8212;&#160;side project a viable business.</p>

<p>I write because I don&#8217;t want to sit in an office for eight to ten hours a day doing anything. I write because I want the freedom writing permits as one of the few things I can do anywhere in the world at whatever time I feel so inclined to put pen to paper, so to speak. I write because I love the writer&#8217;s craft. I don&#8217;t write for pageviews; the number of pageviews I get&#160;&#8212;&#160;incidentally very few, in case you were wondering&#160;&#8212;&#160;is a by-product of this and nothing more, not the driving force behind my fascination and love of this craft.</p>
