<time id='article_time' datetime="2019-07-31 08:59:07-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-07.html">07</a>/31 08:59:07 EST</time>
<p>I started with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-european-diesel-cars/">a simple question</a>: Why does Europe have ultra efficient diesel vehicles, but America does not? I had heard the claims, that some European diesels get up to 80 miles per gallon&#160;&#8212;&#160;yet those in North America eek 50. I had a hunch, that <a href="https://dougdemuro.kinja.com/here-s-why-we-can-t-buy-that-80-mpg-diesel-we-rented-in-1325972764">stringent EPA rules forced auto makers to sell second-rate vehicles in the United States</a>, but I had to know for sure.  </p>

<p>It should have come as no surprise that this is more complex. First, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a4567/4330313/">The United States&#8217; low fuel prices make the upfront cost of diesel engines a tough pill to swallow. Americans also tend to want more speed than efficient, small diesel engines produce</a>. In short, the market for diesels does not exist here. Gasoline reigns supreme because it checks all the boxes for almost everyone.  </p>

<p>But what about that storied efficiency? I would pay more, and live with a slower vehicle, for 80 MPG. As it turns out, though, <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1091877_why-european-gas-mileage-ratings-are-so-high&#160;&#8212;&#160;and-often-wrong">the European mileage test does an even worse job of faking real-world use than the American one</a>. <a href="https://jalopnik.com/why-do-european-cars-get-better-mpg-than-us-cars-5981938">European ratings also use the five quart Imperial gallon used in the United Kingdom, rather than the four quart liquid gallon used in the United States</a>. Accounting for these differences closes the gulf between these ratings to about 10%.  </p>

<p>So what about that 10%? Thanks to some testing Consumer Reports did after the Volkswagen emissions scandal, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-how-much-fuel-economy-and-performance-drops-whe-1735705959">we can thank the Environmental Protection Agency for this</a>. <a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-real-scandal-is-the-epas-diesel-policy-not-volkswagen/">Meeting the EPA&#8217;s stringent rules does have a price</a>, but we cannot blame it for slashing performance by almost half.</p>

<p>This would appear to absolve the EPA of its role in keeping great diesels out of American hands, but not so fast. We cannot blame it for a major gap that does not exist, but we can blame it for making sure the United States never sees some of the best ultra reliable, high-output diesel engines in Europe, and some of the even better ones elsewhere. Coupled with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#8217;s overbearing safety standards, which ban certain vehicles by name, these groups have ensured Americans will never see Land Rover&#8217;s classic Defender, one of the greatest off-road and utility vehicles of all time&#160;&#8212;&#160;or the storied Toyota Hilux and Land Cruiser, which outclass every platform on this side of the globe.</p>

<p>The EPA does not deserve the flak it gets for kneecapping diesel engines in America, but these two agencies deserve much criticism for this.</p>
