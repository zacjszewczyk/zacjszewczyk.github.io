<p>Around minute 44:33 of Cube&#8217;s latest episode, Ben Bajarin theorized that Google&#8217;s motivation in selling Motorola to Lenovo while Samsung simultaneously agreed to scale back their customization of Android could have come about as a result of Samsung desiring access to a concrete feature road map which they could build to in the future. In my last article, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/retroactively-planning.html"><em>Retroactively Planning</em></a>, I talked about how Samsung&#8217;s backwards strategy in which rather than approaching future product creation with a long-held guiding philosophy they must now scramble to infer one from existing successful products is ultimately doomed to failure. Ben&#8217;s theory fits nicely into this picture as a move Samsung could be taking in an attempt at having greater control over their destiny.
