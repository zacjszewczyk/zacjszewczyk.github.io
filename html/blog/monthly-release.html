<p>If you looked at <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack&#8217;s</a> internal commit history, you would see that most features take at most a few days to write. Even the entirety of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0220.html">First Crack&#8217;s rewrite</a> happened over the course of a couple weeks, in the mornings before work and on the weekends. I have stuck with monthly releases since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">June of last year</a>, though, and today I want to explain why.</p>

<p>As I said <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">last year</a>, I started posting monthly release notes, instead of using a traditional versioning system, because the latter implied a cycle of feature integration-feedback-improvement for which I had neither the user base nor the inclination. I also did not want to take such a formal approach to a hobby I work in in my spare time. Still wanting to talk about new features, though, in June I began the series laid out in the list below.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">First Crack Release Notes, June 2019</a></li>

<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0320.html">First Crack Release Notes, March 2020</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0420.html">First Crack Release Notes, April 2020</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Had I decided on a shorter release schedule&#160;&#8212;&#160;even one as small as a week, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;most major features would have still fit within a single development window. I went with an entire month instead, though, for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Regularity</strong>. I can almost always get <em>something</em> done over the course of a month, but I felt less confident about committing to getting something done every week. Things happen; a compressed timeline would have given me less flexibility to account for them. </li>
<li><strong>Overhead</strong>. It takes a non-insignificant amount of work to write the release notes; batching these jobs allows me to minimize overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong>. Declaring that I would do <em>some</em> work on First Crack each month, and that I would then share it with the world, keeps the project moving forward. Although a benefit to any release schedule, month-long development windows make it tough for me to excuse a lack of progress. As I said, things happen&#160;&#8212;&#160;but they seldom happen for an entire month.</li>
</ol>

<p>This strategy has worked well for me. Almost a year later, First Crack has gone from a personal hobby to a polished blog engine. As I have continued to grow as a developer, so, too, has this project. I hope you will <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/firstcrack">check it out</a>, or just stick around for next month&#8217;s release.</p>
