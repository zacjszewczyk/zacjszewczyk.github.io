Fast-forward to today, though, and most of those sites have shut down. The Pirate Bay still manages to <a href="https://www.newidea.com.au/pirate-bay-what-happened-are-there-any-alternatives">limp along</a>, but copyright laws and watchful Internet Service Providers have made piracy a mere shadow of its former self.
