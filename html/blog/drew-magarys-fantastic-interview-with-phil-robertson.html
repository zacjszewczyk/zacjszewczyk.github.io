<p>Recently, Phil Robertson of the sensational cable TV program Duck Dynasty has drawn quite a bit of <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/12/19/255430555/duck-and-cover-what-exactly-is-the-point">flack</a> for his very Christian views kept largely hidden until now through A&E&#8217;s refusal to air his more candid statements. Setting personal opinions aside though and totally disregard the absurdity of crucifying Phil for his beliefs because today&#8217;s hyper-sensitive, disgustingly entitled society seeks to vilify everyone who challenges their nuanced values, and looking at this from an unbiased standpoint, a very interesting lifestyle emerges in <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson">Drew Magary&#8217;s article for GQ</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;incidentally, the article that started this whole debacle. The entire piece is excellent, but if I had to pick my favorite line it came down to Drew&#8217;s revelatory experience toward the end, for I can relate to that very feeling myself:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Whatever you think of Phil&#8217;s beliefs, it&#8217;s hard not to gaze upon his cultivations and wonder if you&#8217;ve gotten life all wrong. This is life as summer camp. It&#8217;s gorgeous, in a way that alters you on an elemental level. I feel it when I breathe the air. I feel it when I survey the enormity of the space around me. I shouldn&#8217;t be sitting around the house and bitching because the new iOS 7 touchscreen icons don&#8217;t have any fucking drop shadow. I should be out here, dammit! Killing things and growing things and bringing dead things home to cook! There is a life out in this wilderness that I am too chickenshit to lead.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spectacular. The most impactful line, however, came just a few paragraphs later at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the direction he would like to point everyone: back to the woods. Back to the pioneer spirit. Back to God. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we go back to the old days?&#8217; he asked me at one point. But now, I&#8217;m afraid, I must get out of the ATV and go back to where I belong, back to the godless part of America that Phil is determined to save.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drew took a very measured approach to the article despite failing to see eye to eye with Phil on quite a few things, and I laud him for that and for his impressive writing ability. Very well done, and worth the read many times over.</p>
