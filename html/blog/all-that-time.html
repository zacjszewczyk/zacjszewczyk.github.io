<p>A little over a year ago, I moved to Fort Gordon for the Cyber Basic Officer Leaders Course. I saw one of my former classmates in the gym this morning, lounging on a bench press near two of his Soldiers. He once said that he did not have hours to spend in the gym every day, and that he had better things to do with his time.</p>

<p>Thirteen months have passed since he said that, so now I have a question for him: what did you do with all that time you saved? Earn some technical certifications? Get a second degree? Start a side hustle? Or did you sleep through it? Did you waste it all watching Netflix?</p>

<p>I spent a lot of my free time <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">in the gym</a>. I started <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">a side hustle</a>. I made <a href="/projects.html">some projects</a>. He made an excuse.</p>

<p>To those of you reading this who have said something similar, I ask the same question: what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>To those of you who did not have the time to workout, what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>To those of you who did not have the time to write, what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>To those of you who did not have the time to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-own-your-platform.html">build a website</a>, what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>If you can say, &#8220;I did all these things&#8221; and follow that up with some real accomplishments, then great&#160;&#8212;&#160;but if not, I bet you did have time for those things after all. Instead, you made an excuse.</p>
