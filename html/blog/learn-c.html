<p>Steve and I came up hearing the same refrain: &#8220;Learn C, it&#8217;ll make you a good programmer&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s how the computer works behind the scenes.&#8221; As he points out in his <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/should-you-learn-c-to-learn-how-the-computer-works">three</a> <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/c-is-not-how-the-computer-works-can-lead-to-inefficient-code">part</a> <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/c-is-how-the-computer-works-is-a-dangerous-mindset-for-c-programmers">series</a>, though, using C just means having a thinner abstraction layer between your code and the hardware on which it runs. That layer still exists. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html">I do believe new developers should learn to work in this environment</a>: understanding the code that underlies usable, high-level languages like Python will help you write better Python for the same reason that understanding assembly will help you write better C; I do not believe they should use it, though, and here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p>Choosing between languages like C and Python should come down to the granularity of control the project demands. C&#8217;s manual memory management will just take away from time spent building real headline features; if you have to do it, and tools like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html"><code>struct</code></a> and <code>del</code> can&#8217;t get the job done, explore your options&#160;&#8212;&#160;but most people don&#8217;t, and the few that must seldom take full advantage of even these tools, let alone Python&#8217;s lesser-known low-level libraries, before jumping ship. Even in high-level languages, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html">you can do a lot</a> to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0320.html">optimize your code</a>. <strong>Do that first</strong>.</p>

<p>Frederick Brooks Jr shared a similar opinion in <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf"><em>No Silver Bullet</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;What does a high-level language accomplish? It frees a program from much of its accidental complexity. An abstract program consists of conceptual constructs: operations, data types, sequences, and communication. The concrete machine program is concerned with bits, registers, conditions, branches, channels, disks, and such. To the extent that the high-level language embodies the constructs wanted in the abstract program and avoids all lower ones, it eliminates a whole level of complexity that was never inherent in the program at all.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ll close with a one-liner for those in search of succinct advice: write Python until you can&#8217;t anymore, then get better at Python; if you still can&#8217;t solve your problem, write C for as narrow a use case as possible, then call the method from your Python script.</p>
