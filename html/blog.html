<p>From David Heinemeier Hansson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s human nature to assume there&#8217;s a good reason for why things are the way they are. And that this reason is either benign, based on careful deliberation, or malignant, derived from malice or incompetence. But this is a false dichotomy that often steers us away from the simpler answer: Nobody thought about this at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given an absence of information, many tend to fill those gaps with generous assumptions. At the beginning of Russia&#8217;s botched invasion of Ukraine, national security pundits considered it some sort of 4D chess game; time proved otherwise. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/675870/no-one-knows-what-theyre-doing">No one knows what they&#8217;re doing</a>, &#8220;It&#8217;s OK though&#160;&#8212;&#160;that&#8217;s not where your problems are coming from. Rather, your problems are coming from the fact that you think other people know what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to a presentation from a large cybersecurity firm the other day. The salesmen&#160;&#8212;&#160;and they were all salesmen, as even a few post-presentation questions made clear&#160;&#8212;&#160;focused on the intelligence their company produced, but knew little about the rest of their company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/Joint-Doctrine-Pubs/2-0-Intelligence-Series/">intelligence cycle</a>. As a consumer of their products, though, I consider knowledge of the process that created them critical. After an hour on finished intelligence, and in particular a slide that touted a &#8220;globally deployed sensor grid&#8221;, I wanted to know more about that production process in general, and about their collection specifically. Unfortunately, when asked, the salesmen offered a handful of handwavy &#8220;We have millions of sensors across the globe&#8221;, and, &#8220;We ingest billions of events per day&#8221; statements, but little beyond that.</p>

<p>I prefer a hands-off approach to management. Describe a goal, give me the freedom and resources to achieve it, and I will. The success of that approach, which the Army calls &#8220;mission command&#8221;, ultimately depends on the <em>right person</em> doing the <em>right things</em> in the <em>right ways</em>. Unfortunately, many focus on that first criterion but neglect the second and the third. In many cases, that leads to failure. In the final days of my last job, in a security operations center (SOC), I realized that this explained many of our systemic problems. We had the <em>right people</em>, they just did the <em>right things</em> in the <em>wrong ways</em> or&#160;&#8212;&#160;in some cases&#160;&#8212;&#160;did the <em>wrong things</em> altogether. This was not an inherent consequence of that hands-off approach, of mission command, but rather a necessary consequence of its partial implementation: we lacked <strong>measures of performance</strong> (MOPs), to assess whether or not (and to what degree) we were doing the <em>right things</em>, and <strong>measures of effectiveness</strong> (MOEs), to assess whether or not (and to what degree) we were doing them in the <em>right ways</em>. In their absence the <em>right things</em> and the <em>right ways</em> became inconsistent and subjective, and so did our success. I wrote this series to fix that.</p>

<p>The Army has a strange relationship with words. On the one hand, precision means everything: the term &#8220;seize&#8221; means something <em>very</em> different to a ground forces commander than the term &#8220;secure&#8221;. On the other hand, &#8220;leader&#8221; has become an umbrella term for both the entire force in general and the select few in command positions specifically. This has little impact on non-commissioned and warrant officers who&#160;&#8212;&#160;for the most part&#160;&#8212;&#160;will never command a unit; &#8220;leadership&#8221;, to them, means leadership: influence to accomplish a mission. For officers, however, the impact of this imprecision is significant.</p>

<p>I frequently encounter people eager to learn or interested in understanding current events but that do not know where to start. Many lack the experience to know what they should study. Others have become so disillusioned by the hyper-partisan twenty-four-hour news cycle that they just ignore current events altogether. While I have addressed those challenges in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/personal-development.html"><em>Personal Development</em></a> and the two-part series <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html"><em>Keeping Up with Current Events</em></a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-evening-reads.html"><em>My Evening Reads</em></a>, respectively, those aggressively curated lists leave out many useful sources that did not make the cut. I just don&#8217;t have time to keep up with everything. This article highlights those sources as well as several other valuable resources. While I may not visit these websites often, these are my first stops when I must seek out trustworthy information on a range of topics. This article also links to several useful tools both as a way for me to keep track of them and as a way to highlight them to others.</p>

<p>Network defenders often struggle to obtain timely, accurate, relevant, predictive, and tailored intelligence about the enemy and other aspects of the operational environment. This document attempts to address that difficulty by detailing a single, curated list of reputable, open sources of threat data, information, and intelligence. This list combines traditional sources such as cybersecurity organizations that publish detailed reports (think finished intelligence) with non-traditional ones like social media that provide feeds more akin to information or raw data. While many others exist, I tried to stick to those with a high signal to noise ratio. That ruled out some decent sources, but I consider that a worthy trade off. Keeping up with this entire list would require a full-time job as-is, so while you may choose differently, choose wisely.</p>

<p>As I close in on my promotion to captain, mentorship has become an increasingly important part of my job. Many new lieutenants find the Basic Officer Leader Course just that&#160;&#8212;&#160;basic&#160;&#8212;&#160;and so they report eager to develop personally, professionally, and militarily. My article <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/personal-development.html"><em>Personal Development</em></a> addresses that first domain in terms of improving one&#8217;s personal, professional, and military <em>knowledge</em>, but neglects other areas. After several conversations with new lieutenants eager for professional development as officers and military development as warfighters, I decided to turn some of those discussion points into a post here. As a Cyberspace Operations Officer, most of this advice will target other 17-series soldiers, although some of it may help new officers in other branches. This advice is also not specific to officers, and in some cases may apply to enlisted soldiers as well.</p>

<p>Aside from maintaining my article on <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/personal-development.html"><em>personal development</em></a>, I have shared little about this profession of arms. As I close in on my promotion to captain, though, mentorship has become an increasingly important part of my job. After several similar conversations with new officers, I decided to answer a common question here: &#8220;What do I do as a new lieutenant?&#8221; While the answer to that question will change from branch to branch and from unit to unit, I decided to write about some advice that should generalize well. If you follow this advice during your first week, you will put yourself in a good spot at the beginning of your assignment and set you up for success in the long run.</p>

Attribution is fraught, as both pieces explain. IP geolocation is woefully inaccurate, many of the tactics, techniques, and procedures tied to specific actors are either so common that they apply to several groups or so general that they might as well, and the proliferation of viable tool sets has made even this metric unreliable. At best, we can attribute activity with a degree of certainty&#160;&#8212;&#160;but never complete confidence, and you should be circumspect of anyone who does.</p>

<p>Outsourcing has put America in a precarious position. It quietly became one of the greatest threats to national security over the course of several decades, unrealized until the Coronavirus pan(dem)ic revealed the fragility of our situation. David Adler and Dan Breznitz, in the American Affairs Journal, discuss the issue and offer some concrete suggestions for fixing it. I encourage you to give it a read.

<p>A smart person knows everything about a single topic. An intelligent person knows as much as possible about more than one topic. Both have great value, and depending on the industry, some organizations value <a href="Smart versus intelligent.html">one more than the other</a>. In general, though, smart people fill entry-level jobs, who then become intelligent people to move up the ladder<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

<p>As best I can remember, I have bought seventeen backpacks in my life. Seven backpacking ones<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and a mix of ten book bags and assault packs<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Each time I bought something new, I upgraded in some way. I went from the <a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/camping-and-hiking/budget-backpacking-pack/teton-sports-scout-3400">Teton Sports Scout 3400</a> to the <a href="http://www.texsport.net/canvas-bags-gear-bags/wolcott-external-frame-pack.html">Texsport Wolcott</a> because it carried better. Next came the <a href="https://speartacticalreviews.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/kelty-falcon-664000-reveiw/">Kelty Falcon 4000</a> because I needed more space and wanted greater versatility and modularity.

With nine more liters of space yet coming in at 60% of the weight, I could not rationalize sticking with the Skycrane II no matter how much I liked it.  </p>

<p>&#8220;It’s tempting to simply laugh off these &#8216;free market&#8217; fetishists as they get their comeuppance when Alex Jones and the Daily Stormer get kicked off the internet, but that is to miss the wider point: we are now in a speech environment where power is so concentrated that the whims of a half-dozen tech execs determine&#160;&#8212;&#160;for all intents and purposes&#160;&#8212;&#160;who may speak and what they may say. If you think that power will only be wielded against Alex Jones, there’s a bunch of trans activists, indigenous activists, anti-pipeline activists, #BlackLivesMatter activists, and others who’d like to have a word with you.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/lightning-round-04dec19.html">Back in December</a>, I applauded Mark Zuckerberg for continuing to push back on demands that Facebook clamp down on its users&#8217; speech.

<p>Megan McArdle making a great point, writing for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you see a person&#160;&#8212;&#160;or a company&#160;&#8212;&#160;doing something that seems completely and inexplicably boneheaded, then it&#8217;s unwise to assume that the reason must be that everyone but you is a complete idiot who is blind to fairly trivial insights such as &#8221;people desire inexpensive and conveniently available movie services, and will resist having those services made more expensive, or less convenient&#8220;.  While it&#8217;s certainly true that people do idiotic things, it&#8217;s also true that a lot of those &#8216;idiotic&#8217; things turn out to have perfectly reasonable explanations.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone has their reasons&#160;&#8212;&#160;and everyone else has a reason for why those reasons are dumb. In leadership, as in writing, it&#8217;s important to remember the latter, and recognize the patent absurdity of the former.</p>

<p>In a draft titled <em>Starting Over</em>, I try to condense a decade&#8217;s worth of outdoor gear experience. The 8,000 word missive, started in 2017, highlights &#8220;The Gear I Would Buy if I Had to Do it All Over Again&#8221;. After thousands of dollars spent searching for the best of the best, it tries help those just starting out avoid some of the expensive lessons I had to learn. That post has not left my drafts folder, though, in part because the list keeps changing. Two weeks in Arizona made me reconsider my chosen boot, the <a href="https://www.vasque.com/mens-hiking-footwear/mens-hiking-boots/st.-elias-fg-gtx-07146.html">Vasque St. Elias GTX</a>, plus I need to try the new <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/equipment-auxiliary-suggested-picks/phantom-50-nf0a3bxv">Phantom 50</a> I bought while there to go with my <a href="https://matadorup.com/products/freerain24-2-0">Matador Freerain 24</a>. I want to move to a more lightweight and season-agnostic setup, and I will have to see how that plays out before I publish the be-all, end-all list for aspiring adventurers. Until then, take a look at these sites. I do a lot of research before I buy, and that research starts here.</p>

<p>John Gray, writing for UnHerd:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As pre-Covid life fades into history, large sections of the professional classes face a version of the experience of those who became former persons in the abrupt historical shifts of the last century. The redundant bourgeoisie need not fear starvation or concentration camps, but the world they have inhabited is evanescing before their eyes. There is nothing novel in what they are experiencing. History is a succession of such apocalypses, and so far this one is milder than most.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as disaster&#8217;s go, COVID-19&#8217;s direct effects have been far less impactful than its indirect ones. Once we have some distance from the event, and can look back on it with less bias, it will become clear that the panic that led to a national shutdown and then economic stagnation <a href="https://www.axios.com/navarro-coronavirus-lockdown-ef2a1335-661b-4f8b-a3a4-79af244f9bbf.html">caused far greater pain and suffering than the disease ever could have</a>, even if we had taken no action. This should be the legacy of COVID-19: not that of a deadly physical disease, but rather a panic-inducing mental one.</p>

<p>Every time I see an article like this one, I think back to something Horace Dediu said in <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/10/making-rain/"><em>Making rain</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I propose a way to think about [the Facebook Home and the Google Fiber issue] as: Google tries to make a business succeed through having a huge amount of <em>flow</em> in terms of data, traffic, queries and information that is indexed. So think about this idea of them tapping into a vast stream. The more volume that is flowing through the system the more revenue they generate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite so altruistic after all.</p>

<p>Today I announce a new project: <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/swig">Swig</a>. Swig is a monolithic, multithreaded, micro web framework designed for an air-gapped intranet environment. Aside from Python 3, it has zero dependencies; just download and deploy. Out of the box, Swig supports IPv4 and IPv6, HTTP and HTTPS, block and chunked responses, and gzip compression. I encourage you to go through <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/swig/blob/master/README.md">the README</a> for more information, and to check out the code <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/swig">on GitHub repo</a>.</p>
