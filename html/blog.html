<p>From Paul Rascagneres and Vitor Ventura at Cisco Talos Intelligence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our tests showed that&#160;&#8212;&#160;on average&#160;&#8212;&#160;we achieved an ~80 percent success rate while using the fake fingerprints, where the sensors were bypassed at least once. ... The results show fingerprints are good enough to protect the average person&#8217;s privacy if they lose their phone. However, a person that is likely to be targeted by a well-funded and motivated actor should not use fingerprint authentication.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all like to get wrapped up in the minutiae of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/plausibly-deniable-encryption.html">architecting overly secure systems</a>, when in reality a determined adversary <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">will succeed in spite of even our best efforts</a>. Most of us are not facing such a sophisticated or determined adversary, though: most of us just need to latch the screen door.</p>

<time id='article_time' datetime="2020-04-20 07:07:20-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2020.html">2020</a>/<a href="/blog/2020-04.html">04</a>/20 07:07:20 EST</time>
<p>As I read Tomas Petricek&#8217;s <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/"><em>On architecture, urban planning and software construction</em></a>, it reminded me of an interesting point Dan Luu made in <a href="https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/"><em>How (some) good corporate engineering blogs are written</em></a>: &#8220;There&#8217;s a dearth of real, in-depth, technical writing, which makes any half decent, honest, public writing about technical work interesting.&#8221; Tomas&#8217; piece reminded me of this not because it lacks substance, but rather for the opposite reason: his work stands out as a prime example of substantial technical writing. I recommend reading <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/">the entire piece</a>, but I will highlight a few interesting points here.</p>

<p>First, on good software design:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Christopher Alexander points out that design always speaks of form and its context. A good design is not just a property of the form, but it is a matter of fit between the form and the context. The reason why we cannot evaluate an isolated form is not because we are unable to precisely describe the form itself, but because we are unable to precisely describe the context with which it will interact. ... Exactly the same limitations exist in the world of programming. No matter how precisely we can talk about programs, we also need to exactly understand the environment with which they interact. This is the hard part.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea that suitability determination involves a multi-dimensional performance assessment on a scenario-by-scenario basis, rather than a simple checklist, is a departure from the process I often see. This approach represents a more complex process, and even a more fraught one, too&#160;&#8212;&#160;but, perhaps, also one that might deliver something usable.</p>

<p>And then on the unintended consequences of avoiding maintenance, later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When discussing maintenance, [Stewart] Brand mentions the cautionary tale of vinyl siding, which is used to avoid problems with peeling paint. Rather than repainting a wooden wall, you cover it with a layer of vinyl siding, which is durable and weather resistant. The problem is that vinyl siding blocks moisture and the humidity behind it can cause structural damage to the building. Many traditional materials have the attractive property that they look bad before they act bad and, furthermore, the problems with traditional materials are well understood. ... The lesson about using traditional materials has a relatively easy parallel. If you build software using tools whose problems you understand, you will be able to expect and resolve those problems. If you are using a new material, you will not anticipate where problems might occur.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To once again pound the drum I just haven&#8217;t stopped beating since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html"><em>Good Times Create Weak Men</em></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;By learning to use frameworks instead of the tools and protocols they implement, developers not only miss out on foundational knowledge that will help them become better at their job, but also hamstring themselves to the subset of features the frameworks’ creators’ felt important enough to enable. Expanding a project beyond that expected use case will require diving into those low-level tools and protocols.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mehul Mohan had a similar take in <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-frontend-web-development/"><em>The Best Way to Learn Front End Web Development</em></a>. I tend to have low expectations for articles that purport to have <strong>the</strong> answer, but Mehul delivered some sound advice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You see, frameworks exist to offload repetitive work from you. They do not exist so that you can not care at all what&#8217;s going on under the hood and rely on the fact that it&#8217;s all magic. The first time you choose a framework like React or Angular for your projects should be <strong>when you&#8217;re confident that you can create that project without React or Angular</strong> too.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/learn-c.html">learn C</a> not to use it, but because it will make you a better programmer. Learning C will help you understand the code that underlies your usable high-level language. node.js vinyl siding is cool, but do not ignore the old-fashioned tools it &#8220;replaced&#8221;: we used&#160;&#8212;&#160;and still use&#160;&#8212;&#160;them for a reason.</p>

<p>Again, I recommend reading <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/">the entire piece</a>.</p>

<p>Steve and I came up hearing the same refrain: &#8220;Learn C, it&#8217;ll make you a good programmer&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s how the computer works behind the scenes.&#8221; As he points out in his <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/should-you-learn-c-to-learn-how-the-computer-works">three</a> <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/c-is-not-how-the-computer-works-can-lead-to-inefficient-code">part</a> <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/c-is-how-the-computer-works-is-a-dangerous-mindset-for-c-programmers">series</a>, though, using C just means having a thinner abstraction layer between your code and the hardware on which it runs.

<p>I have an innate distrust of all writing advice that seem to come from a large organization. I blame academia, for all those years I spent years reading and writing the most rigid, boring prose known to man. I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-writing.html">prefer</a> advice <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-turn-offs.html">from</a> actual <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tbt-writing-vs-writing.html">writers</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that&#8217;s what I found in Harry Guinness&#8217;s recent article for The New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-edit-your-own-writing.html"><em>How to Edit Your own Writing</em></a>. He offers some great advice, and makes some excellent book recommendations. To add to that list, I also recommend William Zinsser&#8217;s <em>On Writing Well</em>, and Stephen King&#8217;s <em>On Writing</em>: Harry&#8217;s books focus on the mechanics, while these concern themselves with the craft.</p>

<p>I agree with Kev, that readers should have the ability to view my work in whatever format they please, but I still truncate the posts in my RSS feed. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p>Whenever I find a new <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-evening-reads.html">writer</a>, I go through everything they have ever written&#160;&#8212;&#160;turns out, good writers write good things often; this helps me find great works from their past. RSS feeds with, say, the site&#8217;s ten most recent posts make this much harder than ones with every article in them, so when <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">I restarted this site</a>, I took the latter route. Over a thousand posts would make my feed a hefty __ MB, though, so truncating the individual posts allowed me to strike a nice balance between the two.</p>

<p>Mozilla&#8217;s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2017/12/16/Firefox-is-on-a-slippery-slope.html">mistakes</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;although <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/mozilla-is-becoming-evil-be-careful-with-firefox.html">concerning</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;worry me less than Google&#8217;s methodical Internet takeover. Indulge me while I bring the uninformed up to speed: after eviscerating its competitors, over half the Internet now uses Chrome. This dominance gives its creator the power to force sweeping change across this decentralized system: although superficially optional, failure to comply means longer load times, lower search ranking, and lost revenue. Over the last few years in particular, the company has shown an increased willingness to wield that power with more and more aggressive mandates. Publishers who do not expose their content through Accelerated Mobile Pages <a href="https://medium.com/the-set-list/google-amp-a-70-drop-in-our-conversion-rate-35fe3cb69c59">lose viewers and income</a>.

It all leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So while I find Mozilla&#8217;s mistakes concerning, I like the thought of supporting Chrome even less, so I decided to give <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> another try.</p>

<p>Micah Lee, writing for The Intercept, in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/03/zooms-encryption-is-not-suited-for-secrets-and-has-surprising-links-to-china-researchers-discover/"><em>Zoom’s Encryption Is &#8220;Not Suited for Secrets&#8221; and Has Surprising Links To China, Researchers Discover</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Some of the key management systems — 5 out of 73, in a Citizen Lab scan — seem to be located in China, with the rest in the United States. Interestingly, the Chinese servers are at least sometimes used for Zoom chats that have no nexus in China. ... The report points out that Zoom may be legally obligated to share encryption keys with Chinese authorities if the keys are generated on a key management server hosted in China.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This just makes an adversary&#8217;s easy job even easier, though, thanks to the weak encryption scheme those keys facilitate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A security white paper from the company claims that Zoom meetings are protected using 256-bit AES keys, but the Citizen Lab researchers confirmed the keys in use are actually only 128-bit ... Furthermore, Zoom encrypts and decrypts with AES using an algorithm called Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, &#8216;which is well-understood to be a bad idea, because this mode of encryption preserves patterns in the input,&#8217; according to the Citizen Lab researchers. In fact, ECB is considered the worst of AES&#8217;s available modes.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton&#8217;s study, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/"><em>Move Fast &#38; Roll Your Own Crypto</em></a>, goes into more detail, and concludes with this key takeaway: &#8220;As a result of these troubling security issues, we discourage the use of Zoom at this time for use cases that require strong privacy and confidentiality&#8221;. Unfortunately, though, most of Zoom&#8217;s competitors don&#8217;t do much better.</p>

Although a simple fix later slashed First Crack&#8217;s runtime, I waited to post the code until I could talk about a few things here.</p>

<p>Ignat Korchagin posted a fantastic writeup on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/speeding-up-linux-disk-encryption/">speeding up Linux disk encryption</a> to Cloudflare&#8217;s blog. The lengths that team went to in order to solve this problem are fascinating. Dan Luu hit the nail on the head <a href="https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/">when he highlighted Cloudflare&#8217;s as an example of a great corporate blog</a>.</p>

<p>For those looking for more interesting reads, Dan highlighted a few other corporate engineering blogs in <a href="https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/">his post</a>; start there.

<p>Jay Rayner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis">writing for The Guardian</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system [the fragile global food distribution system] has come from. &#8216;There is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.&#8217; Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add a century and replace &#8220;British&#8221; with &#8220;American&#8221;, and Tim Lang&#8217;s words apply just as well to the United States. Like Tim, I hold out hope that the nation will wake up and make a change; you would have to be a fool to bank on it, though. Exercise your individual liberty now to prepare for the all too likely crises ahead. Far too many are content just to whistle past the graveyard.</p>

<p>Jean-Louis Gassee, in <a href="https://mondaynote.com/arm-ed-mac-we-have-an-answer-545a20419a46">yesterday&#8217;s Monday Note</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;An answer to the now age-old ARM-ed Mac question now emerges: With the emphasis on the iPad Pro as a real computer, there&#8217;s no reason for Apple to move the Mac off of trusty if perhaps less glamorous Intel processors.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I may finish his sentence, &#8220;... there&#8217;s no reason for Apple to move the Mac off of trusty if perhaps less glamorous Intel processors, <em>because the iPad will soon replace the Mac</em>.&#8221; As for when this will happen, I don&#8217;t know&#160;&#8212;&#160;and if Jean-Louis does, he&#8217;s not saying. With each passing year it becomes more feasible from a technical standpoint, but it will take a sea change in Apple&#8217;s strategic thinking for this to actually happen.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the electric car situation: they have gotten pretty good, but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expediton-vehicles.html">at least for my use case</a>, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-electric-vehicle-wish-list.html">they aren&#8217;t quite good enough</a>. I can see that this will change soon, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;again&#160;&#8212;&#160;it will take a sea change in strategic thinking to make this happen. In this case, that means automakers stop trying to turn a truck into an electric truck, and start designing vehicles to take full advantage of all this new technology enables.</p>

<p>As I start shopping around to replace my trusty 2013 MacBook Pro, I hope Apple will make its decision soon.</p>

<p>Hilarious. Ian also got at a critical point about the state of modern software engineers, something I touched on a few weeks ago when I linked to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html"><em>Good TImes Create Weak Men</em></a>. Short-term, push-button fixes attempt to get around the long, hard, and expensive problem of developing and deploying expertise. Like outsourcing, while the former approach has <a href="http://berthub.eu/articles/posts/national-outsourcing/">short-term benefits</a>, its <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9da/f5cc1c94c6e34e29095ca168e8fa2d750df9.pdf">long-term effects are debilitating</a>.</p>

<p>Dan Moore&#8217;s 2018 post, <a href="http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/2765"><em>When do you earn your pay?</em></a>, reminded me of something I told one of my friends a few years ago. Both senior ROTC cadets at the time, he had just finished complaining about how our instructors always blamed him when other people did the wrong thing. &#8220;You&#8217;re not here for things to go right,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;the only reason our job exists is to fix things when they go wrong.&#8221; This leads into a larger point about the role of Officers in the Army, but I need to spend more time thinking about that before I start writing about it; for now, this will have to suffice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans have gone west to escape the ills of society while bringing the ills of society with them, pretty much since Manifest Destiny; one regional myth was that, once here, everyone would have the chance to experience something wild. In reality, of course, settlement always brought land-access issues, prompted human displacement, and fueled socioeconomic disparity. That remains true now, as Billionaire Wilderness makes evident through its examination of one of the most beloved playgrounds of this part of the nation.&#8221;</p>

<time id='article_time' datetime="2020-03-04 17:53:30-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2020.html">2020</a>/<a href="/blog/2020-03.html">03</a>/04 17:53:30 EST</time>
<p>Simple systems deploy faster than complex ones, and fail less often; sometimes they take less time to build, too, but the pursuit of simplicity often entails a long process to prioritize some features while justifying the exclusion of others. Ironically, that process tends to take much longer than just building in all the features, so most choose the latter approach. The end result is complex software that does many things, but few things well.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html">fan of premature optimization</a>, I like to take the opposite approach, and to take it to the extreme. <a href="/projects.html#codingProjects">My software</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;and even my devices&#160;&#8212;&#160;tend to do one thing well. This makes the upfront cost higher in terms of time spent planning projects, writing code, and purchasing hardware, but also&#160;&#8212;&#160;since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html">I understand and control the entire stack</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;lowers the number of opaque systems that can fail as well as the knock-on effects of such an event. I consider this a worthwhile tradeoff, and I bet <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">Greg would, too</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">don&#8217;t like</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html">dependencies</a>, but excusing one language&#8217;s reliance on bucketloads of them because others use built-in libraries misses the point. I care about the number of dependencies I have to install just for your project. On a system full of libraries that could have met most of those requirements, as evidenced by other, similar projects that do not need hundreds of extra packages, the fact that yours does gives me pause. The fact that this language seems to cause this leads me to believe some fundamental shortcoming must exist. Let&#8217;s not excuse that.</p>

<p>Over a decade ago, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">Keven Kelly put forward the idea that creators could earn a living from 1,000 fans</a>. In <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/">this piece</a>, Li Jin proposes that they can do the same from 100 super fans. Crucially, though, as the number of patrons goes down, the value that creator provides must go up. Many seem to forget this last point, and see headlines like these as evidence that they can somehow make it with 1,000 subscribers or 100 readers. It just doesn&#8217;t work. Understand the tradeoffs, make a realistic plan, and never <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html">quit</a>.</p>

<p>I read a few of Marcus&#8217;s posts, and liked <a href="https://utf9k.net/blog/25/">them</a> <a href="https://utf9k.net/blog/email-lookup/">all</a>, but it was <a href="https://utf9k.net/blog/publish-old-works/">his link</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/X2wLP0izeJE">an interview with Ira Glass</a> that made me post this. Most have heard this many times before, but it bears repeating: doing good work means first doing a lot of bad work, and having the tenacity to get through those discouraging times. The great creators, to whom far too many aspiring creators prematurely compare themselves, made it through because they pressed on. Success is not a mystery, it&#8217;s just <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html">hard</a>. Put in the work to get there.</p>

<p>Josh Constine, writing for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s suspiciously convenient that Facebook already fulfills most of the regulatory requirements it&#8217;s asking governments to lay on the rest of the tech industry. ... We already saw this happen with GDPR. The idea was to strengthen privacy and weaken exploitative data collection that tech giants like Facebook and Google depend on for their business models. The result was that Facebook and Google actually gained or only slightly lost EU market share while all other adtech vendors got wrecked by the regulation, according to WhoTracksMe.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suspicious, no; convenient, yes; par for the course&#160;&#8212;&#160;also yes. What a surprise.</p>
