<p>Quite some time ago I came across Jeffrey Way&#8217;s article <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/editorials/publishers-dont-restrict-writers/"><em>Publishers: Don&#8217;t Restrict Writers</em></a> and added it to my Instapaper queue more out of curiosity at an article posted on Nettuts+ not about programming than anything else. Nearly a month prior, I had read an article on Ben Brooks&#8217; website called <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/11/self-publishing/"><em>Self-Publishing</em></a> in which he said something I found very interesting:</p>

<p>I have an innate distrust of all writing advice that seem to come from a large organization. I blame academia, for all those years I spent years reading and writing the most rigid, boring prose known to man. I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-writing.html">prefer</a> advice <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-turn-offs.html">from</a> actual <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tbt-writing-vs-writing.html">writers</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that&#8217;s what I found in Harry Guinness&#8217;s recent article for The New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-edit-your-own-writing.html"><em>How to Edit Your own Writing</em></a>. He offers some great advice, and makes some excellent book recommendations. To add to that list, I also recommend William Zinsser&#8217;s <em>On Writing Well</em>, and Stephen King&#8217;s <em>On Writing</em>: Harry&#8217;s books focus on the mechanics, while these concern themselves with the craft.</p>

<p>Mozilla&#8217;s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2017/12/16/Firefox-is-on-a-slippery-slope.html">mistakes</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;although <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/mozilla-is-becoming-evil-be-careful-with-firefox.html">concerning</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;worry me less than Google&#8217;s methodical Internet takeover. Indulge me while I bring the uninformed up to speed: after eviscerating its competitors, over half the Internet now uses Chrome. This dominance gives its creator the power to force sweeping change across this decentralized system: although superficially optional, failure to comply means longer load times, lower search ranking, and lost revenue. Over the last few years in particular, the company has shown an increased willingness to wield that power with more and more aggressive mandates. Publishers who do not expose their content through Accelerated Mobile Pages <a href="https://medium.com/the-set-list/google-amp-a-70-drop-in-our-conversion-rate-35fe3cb69c59">lose viewers and income</a>.

It all leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So while I find Mozilla&#8217;s mistakes concerning, I like the thought of supporting Chrome even less, so I decided to give <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> another try.</p>

<p>Ian Eyberg in <a href="https://rap.mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm"><em>Containers are Not the Future</em></a>, quoting a line from <a href="https://rap.mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm">Mike Rapoport and James Bottomley&#8217;s talk at this year&#8217;s Free and Open source Software Developers&#8217; European Meeting</a>:</p>

<p>&#8220;The kernel developers view of the docker community is that in the rare case they can actually formulate the question correctly they usually don&#8217;t understand the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilarious. Ian also got at a critical point about the state of modern software engineers, something I touched on a few weeks ago when I linked to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html"><em>Good TImes Create Weak Men</em></a>. Short-term, push-button fixes attempt to get around the long, hard, and expensive problem of developing and deploying expertise. Like outsourcing, while the former approach has <a href="http://berthub.eu/articles/posts/national-outsourcing/">short-term benefits</a>, its <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9da/f5cc1c94c6e34e29095ca168e8fa2d750df9.pdf">long-term effects are debilitating</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">don&#8217;t like</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html">dependencies</a>, but excusing one language&#8217;s reliance on bucketloads of them because others use built-in libraries misses the point. I care about the number of dependencies I have to install just for your project. On a system full of libraries that could have met most of those requirements, as evidenced by other, similar projects that do not need hundreds of extra packages, the fact that yours does gives me pause. The fact that this language seems to cause this leads me to believe some fundamental shortcoming must exist. Let&#8217;s not excuse that.</p>

<p>I took two weeks off work around Christmas. I spent the first touring Arizona, and the second at my parents&#8217; farm in Ohio. After a 605lb deadlift PR in early December, I felt like a break from the gym. Plus, I did not workout for the three weeks I spent driving up the east coast in 2018. Gym access did not factor into this trip&#8217;s planning process either, and so over those fifteen days, I worked out three times. Today, I want to share some thoughts about fitness on the road.</p>

<p>I love stories like <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">Adam&#8217;s</a>. Too many people propose complex solutions to simple problems because they get excited about building something cool, and lose sight of their actual purpose: building a useful tool. I see this all the time at work. In this case, another developer used a Big Data approach for a Small Data problem, and Adam shows how a much simpler&#160;&#8212;&#160;but less cool(?)&#160;&#8212;&#160;one would have got it done much, much faster. Had this other developer <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html">understood the underlying technologies</a>, and taken some time for <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html">premature optimization</a>, he might have gotten there himself.</p>

<p>The Economist took an interesting look at how citizens view politicians when they lie, and their conclusion warrants concern: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You might expect (or hope) that thoughtful people would be more amenable to the force of fact-based evidence than most. Alas, no. According to David Perkins of Harvard University, the brighter people are, the more deftly they can conjure up post-hoc justifications for arguments that back their own side.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads well into a point Ryan Holiday made back in March, in <a href="https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1"><em>It&#8217;s Not Enough to Be Right&#160;&#8212;&#160;You Also Have to Be Kind</em></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There is this unshakeable assumption that if they can just present the right fact[, ...] that people will change their minds. ... After spending years and millions of words and hours of video on this, we&#8217;ve had almost zero success. Why? Because you can&#8217;t reason people out of positions they didn&#8217;t reason themselves into. No one responds well to having their identity attacked. No argument made in bad faith&#160;&#8212;&#160;that the person on the other side is a moron or a dupe or a racist or a snowflake&#160;&#8212;&#160;is ever going to be received in good faith.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sooner this becomes not just common knowledge, but also common practice, the sooner we can move beyond petty divisions and focus on <a href="https://dchhaddendum.libsyn.com/ep7-hardcore-history-on-fire">steering the empire from total collapse</a>.</p>

<p>Joe Jackson has some good tips for better camp kitchens. I like to keep everything for cooking, eating, and cleaning in one container, packed at all times. I keep a second one empty for dry goods. This makes trip prep a breeze: I just load the first tote in my car, then fill up the second tote and my cooler in the grocery store&#8217;s parking lot on my way out of town. Along with <a href="http://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/furniture/tables/regular-dining-table">two dining tables</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B001QC31G6">two water jugs</a>, and <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">my storage system</a>, this setup makes cooking tough meals easy, and eating them fun.</p>

<p>In an article I will post soon, I mention the difference between smart and intelligent people. I have seen this explained in more ways than I can count, but none the way I define it. Rather than burying this in an already long piece, I want to talk about it here so that I can flesh it out and then cite it later.</p>

<p>I have an article in the works on a similar topic, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight this piece by one of my favorite new writers, <a href="http://blairreeves.me/">Blair Reeves</a>, before I reference it there. He makes some great points about the value of blogging, even if you have no intention of ever turning it into a revenue stream.</p>

<p>I came across this story thanks to <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/22/6053213/pokemon-black-creepypasta">Polygon&#8217;s refutation</a> of the mod&#8217;s existence, but fortunately thought to read <a href="http://tinycartridge.com/post/866743831/super-creepy-pokemon-hack">the original article</a> over at Tiny Cartridge first&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I would recommend you do as well. &#8220;Creepy&#8221; barely scratches the surface of this haunting tale. Especially if you, like me, grew up loving Pokemon, I encourage you to take a few minutes and read this story; it&#8217;s remarkably well-done.</p>

<p>The idea that one could survive and prosper based on their merits alone is a comforting idea. If this story teaches us anything though, it teaches us that increasingly, it is nothing more than that&#160;&#8212;&#160;little more than a comforting notion in a world where mom and dad can open their wallets to make any door spring open before their baby. I signed eight years of my life away in exchange for a four-year education, and while <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/looking-to-the-future.html">I don&#8217;t regret that decision in the least</a>, it&#8217;s remarkably disheartening to see others reap similar rewards in exchange for their father&#8217;s signature and a brief &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very interesting point from Benedict Evans at the tail end of this article, where he points out that Apple&#8217;s <em>decision</em> not to build a larger phone, and the company&#8217;s decision not to enter the mid- to low-end, place it in a very powerful position going forward as those decisions can be reversed at any time. Much more powerful a position than its competitors, because unlike Apple who possess the ability to ship phones with these capabilities but has thus far deigned not to, others have proven wholly incapable of creating the aspects that make Apple&#8217;s products so valuable. Going forward, that ought to cause a great deal of concern amongst some, while a great deal of hope among others.</p>

<p>In a style made popular by Benedict Evans in his hallmark Twitter postulations, posit: computers were created for writers. As such, the next iteration of computing devices will cater to the needs of others: creators and designers will have Jarvis-like artificial intelligence systems to converse with and holographic interfaces to involve their entire bodies in the creation process. The current model involves the two tools of the writer&#8217;s trade: their hands and their minds. Future implementations will go beyond those unnecessary restrictions that don&#8217;t apply in other fields in order to provide a richer, more productive computing experience.</p>

<p>Yes; fantastic piece from Sid O&#8217;Neill. I myself have begun to wonder the same things lately, questioning how I became so pedantic and obsessed with things of such little real importance that I would wax on endlessly about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/misunderstood.html">a simple ad</a>, of all things. Yet, unlike Sid, I have been able to suppress those uncomfortable questions until very recently. As time marches on, however, and the amount of time I devote to this hobby only grows, this is a very real reality that I must confront. And as for what I will ultimately answer? Time will only tell; were I forced to make a prediction now, though, I would wager I end up on the same side of this issue as Sid.</p>

<p>A remarkably short list for you this week, if it even deserves such a title as &#8220;list&#8221; with only two members. But, nevertheless, it does contain the two best podcast episodes I encountered over the last seven days. So enjoy, and maybe this weekend spend a little less time with headphones in your ears.</p>

<p>Over the past week especially, there has been a fair bit of discussion devoted to podcasting&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Blogger moment&#8221;. In particular, John Gruber and Mike Monteiro discussed this on <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/80/">the latest episode of The Talk Show</a>, and Myke Hurley and Casey Liss spent some time talking about it on <a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/96">CMD+SPACE 96: Not Many Original Thoughts, with Casey Liss</a> as well. In a nutshell, the idea is that just as Blogger brought blogging to the masses in the early 2000s and consequently caused the medium to explode in popularity, so too will podcasting have a similar moment whereby it breaks through the nerd barrier and goes mainstream. Interestingly, many at the forefront of the podcast medium believe that time to be now. For what reasons they believe this, however, I cannot say.</p>

<p>Education is a topic near and dear to my heart, so whenever I can find an interesting, well-written article on the subject I tend to afford it slightly more attention than I might Business Insider&#8217;s terrible article explaining possible reasons behind Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Oculus. Unfortunately, these articles often turn out mediocre at best; this piece by Clay Shirky, however, and its predecessor <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/"><em>Napster, Udacity, and the Academy</em></a>, are both very interesting in-depth looks at the problems facing higher education in America. You will have to spend a while reading both of these, but it will be time well spent.</p>

<p>Fascinating look at the percentage of household income various countries spend on groceries each year. Surprisingly, that number has steadily decreased over the past thirty years. In response to Businessweek&#8217;s chart, on display at the beginning of The Typist&#8217;s article, The Atlantic wrote <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/cheap-eats-how-america-spends-money-on-food/273811/">a great, in-depth piece</a> taking the discussion a few steps farther.

<p>Tomorrow morning at three o&#8217;clock, I will wake up three hours earlier than normal; within sixty minutes of getting out of bed, I will be on my way to the Pittsburgh International Airport; five hours after awakening&#160;&#8212;&#160;if all goes well, and weather permitting&#160;&#8212;&#160;my plane will take off bound for the Bahamian island of San Salvador where I will reside for a week as part of a geology class I enrolled in at the beginning of this semester. After several weeks of in-class study, this trip will allow my class and I to gain valuable field experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;hence the class title, &#8220;Field Investigative Geology&#8221;. Because I will go San Salvador with the express purpose of gaining field experience, due to the research center&#8217;s isolated and somewhat dated nature, and as a result of the island&#8217;s location far outside of America&#8217;s borders, I will have no way of accessing the internet from Wednesday morning until the following Friday. As a courtesy to all my readers, then, rather than simply going off-grid for an entire week without notice, I just wanted to take a moment and give you a heads-up.</p>

<p>I have a very light issue for you this month, unfortunately: precious little caught my eye over the past few weeks. In fact, just two articles did, and only one came from Cabin Porn: a <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/77427808607/3rd-generation-hand-made-family-cabin-on-the-upper">third-generation hand-made cabin from Michigan</a>. This structure, to me, defines the genre: built of wood and stone and out in the middle of the woods, not some modern architecture retrofitted into a rustic getaway a few hundred feet from the nearest road, this cabin has <em>character</em>. And I love that about it.</p>

<p>Great look at the industry&#8217;s leading font providers, Hoefler &#38; Frere-Jones, Typekit, and Google Fonts, made all the more valuable because now I won&#8217;t have to shell out $150 to ultimately go back to Google Fonts in the end. In a sense, as light bulbs are to Marco Arment, so too are fonts to The Typist in this article. Also worth noting with regards to Google&#8217;s offering is that in addition to making an ever-expanding library of fonts available for the attractive price of free, the ubiquity of these fonts over the more expensive options from H&#38;FJ and Typekit makes caching and, thus, decreased load times something to consider as well.</p>
