</h2>
<time id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-10 11:21:10-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/10 11:21:10 EST</time>
<p>Despite it&#8217;s oxymoron of a title, this is a great piece by Felix Martin for Wired drawing some interesting parallels between Bitcoin and the monetary system of sixteenth-century Europe. Bitcoin has enjoyed a great deal of support up until now, but the jury is still out as to whether it will turn in to a viable, stable currency or go down in history as a somewhat lengthy flash in the pan. Hopefully, though, for the reasons Felix laid out in his conclusion, Bitcoin will.</p>

<p>Virtually every time Dan Benjamin is interviewed, the host eventually asks the same question posed by numerous interviewers of days gone by: &#8220;When people ask what you do, what do you tell them?&#8221; And every time, Dan answers the same way, saying that his answer depends on the person asking. For some, Dan responds that he is in broadcasting and leaves it at that; in other cases he goes in to more detail, qualifying that statement by describing his podcast network. He chooses his answer based on the level to which that person would understand his explanation, because as Dan has said each time in response to the aforementioned question, there are some people that still don&#8217;t know what podcasts are.</p>

</h2>
<time id='article_time' datetime="2019-05-28 08:32:35-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-05.html">05</a>/28 08:32:35 EST</time>
<p>I am immediately skeptical of any framework for getting something done. Individuals often use these elaborate processes to procrastinate, and in organizations they have a tendency to become bloated risk avoidance mechanisms. I see the former danger in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">David Maciver&#8217;s strategy for doing hard things</a>, but it did remind me of my own, so I want to take a minute to share my approach here.</p>

<p>In short, just do the hard thing. When you don&#8217;t feel like working out, <a href="https://youtu.be/N3t-em026ec">go</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/1023918579522002944">anyway</a>. When you don&#8217;t feel like writing, write anyway. The more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19958340">something scares you</a>, the more important it is that you get aggressive, charge into it, and crush that thing until it holds no power over you. You might need a twelve step process to conquer that hard thing, but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">just like in weightlifting</a>, give hard work a try first.</p>
