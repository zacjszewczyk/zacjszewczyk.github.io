<p>&#8220;The cap on WWDC tickets means it won&#8217;t go the way of SXSW - a wildly successful conference that has grown consistently since its inception. I used to go every year until one late night we looked around a huge sea of strangers and decided that we no longer knew this conference. The experience had become diluted. It had become unfamiliar, full of strangers, and unknowable.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the most part, I didn&#8217;t follow the discussion surrounding WWDC ticket sales after they sold out in under two minutes. I read <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/26/the-lottery">John Siracusa&#8217;s article</a> on the topic, but for the most part stayed out of the conversation. I haven&#8217;t ever gone to WWDC, after all, nor do I plan to in the foreseeable future. From the few articles I did see, however, and based on the numerous podcasts that touched on the subject, I noticed that by far the vast majority criticized Apple for capping WWDC attendance at 5,000. Michael Lopp&#8217;s piece linked at the top of this article was the only piece of note I came across defending Apple&#8217;s decision, and easily the best.</p>

<p>As a brief aside before you go on your way, before tonight I had only heard of Michael Lopp in name. Specifically, I remember this one time, very distinctly for some reason, John Gruber mentioned him and his blog on an episode of The Talk Show. After reading <em>Unknowable</em>, I took a few minutes to check out his site. Ten minutes later I finished adding Rands in Repose to my RSS reader; I was very impressed. Over the next half hour I jumped between this article and <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/08/28/youre_not_listening.html"><em>You&#8217;re Not Listening</em></a>, an article from last year about verbal communication and all its curious little nuances. It was a very interesting read and a representative sample of the type and quality of article Michael Lopp writes. As I suggested at the end of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tumblr-plus-yahoo.html"><em>Tumblr. + Yahoo! = !!</em></a>, if you are unfamiliar with his work, go check it out.</p>

<p>Patrick George over at Jalopnik <a href="https://jalopnik.com/i-ve-been-thinking-about-picking-up-an-old-4runner-or-l-1837864980">posted a picture</a> of a Toyota BXD20 the other day, and I had to check it out. Kinja <a href="https://oppositelock.kinja.com/m-e-g-a-the-rarest-toyota-on-this-side-of-the-world-a-1822806540">had a nice article about the vehicle</a>. I would not say no to a BXD, but given the chance to build on a platform like this, I would just go with a similar AM General Humvee. AM General has built almost 10,000 per year since 1984 for militaries around the world, which has proven the vehicle&#8217;s reliability and made it readily available for cheap. With a few modifications, like <a href="https://www.flashoffroad.com/Improvements/Lockers/Eaton/EatonLockers.htm">locking differentials</a>, I would have a similar rig for much less time and money.</p>

<p>Finally getting around to a few blogs I have wanted to check out for almost a week now, earlier this morning I read Harshil Shah&#8217;s third blog post since starting his new site. I enjoyed his refreshing honesty, and his new approach seems like a great middle ground between pushing so hard he burns out once again and posting two articles for the entirety of 2013. I look forward to reading more of his excellent writing <a href="https://twitter.com/harshilshah1910/status/422039100074373120">very soon</a>, and you should too.</p>
