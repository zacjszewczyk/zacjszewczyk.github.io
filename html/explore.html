<p>I often start strong: I have an idea, direction, and inspiration; I know where I want to take this brand new piece and how I will get there. If I&#8217;m lucky, that article will go live within a day or two of its inception; if not, well, that&#8217;s when I have a problem.</p>

<p>The last article I wrote I called &#8220;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/printing-money.html">Printing Money</a>&#8221;. I started writing that piece on December first of last year, more than five months ago. After a few days I lost interest, and it remained an unfinished blurb until last week when I stumbled across it. Last week, meaning it sat in Drafts for somewhere in the ballpark of three days to just under a week after I rediscovered it and before I put any effort into improving it, before last night when I sat down in Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and put enough work in to the aticle to call it finished enough to publish without feeling too guilty. I did the same thing with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/citational-fallacy.html"><em>Citational Fallacy</em></a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-key-to-education-reform.html"><em>The Key to Education Reform</em></a>, establishing an unfortunate trend. I had such high hopes and grand aspriations for those three articles at the onset, and look at them now: a shadow of what they could have been. Still good by most standards, but far inferior to the articles I could have published had I set them on the back burner and waited a while instead of forging ahead and publishing each article before it was actually ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your job? You pick up the freshest, most interesting coffee from tiny roasters who do not drop ship (and of varieties not listed online from bigger roasters) and send them by request to customers around the world. Your customers trust you as a reporter and pay a small premium to have access to the strange diversity that surrounds you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first installment of Rich Stevens&#8217; handmade, artisanal newsletter list. It&#8217;s been great fun so far; I look forward to each new release.</p>

<p>Prompted by <a href="https://twitter.com/typistx/status/422270033340166144">a question from Shibel</a> early this morning wondering how I determine where to publish a given article, to my site or my new newsletter, I decide what content goes where and when to release it based on a relatively simple heuristic: when I write for my website I strive to do so in service of furthering the overarching narrative with regards to topics I currently have some degree of interest in. Pursuant of this goal, I write long form articles and link to others&#8217; work who have varying viewpoints and provide commentary I feel my readers will value but may not otherwise see elsewhere. I started The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter to have a place in which I could write without those restrictions, somewhere that I could publish my thoughts on any given topic not beholden to a desire to advance its associated conversation. This will manifest itself in new genres I have previously only covered on occasion or not at all.</p>

<p>Take my brief digress in to the second season of House of Cards in the latest issue, for example: I would not have written anything about it otherwise, yet this medium provided me with a platform through which I could share my thoughts on the matter. Similarly, with the exception of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/castro.html">Castro</a> I rarely write about new apps, instead choosing to leave that to the likes of Federico Viticci who I know will do a much better job than I ever could. However, the first installment of what will hopefully become many newsletters in the future features two mini reviews of Network and Command-C. Albeit only a paragraph or two in length, these opinions would have never seen the light of day had I not put them into this newsletter.</p>

<p>This is how I will designate articles and topics to one venue or the other. Think of The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter as an extension of my website governed by fewer rules and policed with less severity, a backstage pass of sorts giving you added insight into any and all subjects on my mind. I will still devote most of my time to writing original articles and collecting interesting pieces from around the internet, but now I have an outlet for everything that does not make it through the stringent editing process.</p>
