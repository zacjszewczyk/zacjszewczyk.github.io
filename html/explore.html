<p>&#8220;The cap on WWDC tickets means it won&#8217;t go the way of SXSW - a wildly successful conference that has grown consistently since its inception. I used to go every year until one late night we looked around a huge sea of strangers and decided that we no longer knew this conference. The experience had become diluted. It had become unfamiliar, full of strangers, and unknowable.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the most part, I didn&#8217;t follow the discussion surrounding WWDC ticket sales after they sold out in under two minutes. I read <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/26/the-lottery">John Siracusa&#8217;s article</a> on the topic, but for the most part stayed out of the conversation. I haven&#8217;t ever gone to WWDC, after all, nor do I plan to in the foreseeable future. From the few articles I did see, however, and based on the numerous podcasts that touched on the subject, I noticed that by far the vast majority criticized Apple for capping WWDC attendance at 5,000. Michael Lopp&#8217;s piece linked at the top of this article was the only piece of note I came across defending Apple&#8217;s decision, and easily the best.</p>

<p>As a brief aside before you go on your way, before tonight I had only heard of Michael Lopp in name. Specifically, I remember this one time, very distinctly for some reason, John Gruber mentioned him and his blog on an episode of The Talk Show. After reading <em>Unknowable</em>, I took a few minutes to check out his site. Ten minutes later I finished adding Rands in Repose to my RSS reader; I was very impressed. Over the next half hour I jumped between this article and <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/08/28/youre_not_listening.html"><em>You&#8217;re Not Listening</em></a>, an article from last year about verbal communication and all its curious little nuances. It was a very interesting read and a representative sample of the type and quality of article Michael Lopp writes. As I suggested at the end of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tumblr-plus-yahoo.html"><em>Tumblr. + Yahoo! = !!</em></a>, if you are unfamiliar with his work, go check it out.</p>

<p>I found this article after <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/2016/07/22/making-obvious-fast.html"><em>Making the obvious code fast</em></a>, where Jack Mott explained the impact of ignoring basic optimization. In his 2016 piece <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/tools/editor/ide/visual/studio/2016/07/01/marginal-gains.html"><em>Marginal Gains</em></a>, he went over some small tips to make developers&#8217; lives easier. He had some good suggestions, and I want to take a minute to emphasize one of his points.</p>

<p><strong>Use the command line as much as possible, so that you can automate as much of your work as possible.</strong> Most programs wrap one or more command line tools. This helps non-technical people. Take out the middleman, though, learn to use the underlying tool, and then write a script to work for you. Automate the boring tasks, so that you can focus on the exciting ones, take on new roles, further your own education, or even start a side hustle.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time optimizing images for the web, for example, <a href="https://imageoptim.com/command-line.html">let the command line handle that</a>. Do you work with videos? <a href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.2.0/cli/command-line-reference.html">It can handle that, too</a>. If you spend hours scrolling through thousands of lines of log files, <a href="http://droptips.com/using-grep-to-exclude-lines-containing-certain-characterstext">why not save some time by taking out all traffic to the server from your developers&#8217; machines?</a> You cannot do everything with the command line, but you can free yourself from the boring in favor of more challenging and interesting work.</p>

<p>I have a lot of thoughts about choosing an expedition rig. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">I went over them before</a>, so I won&#8217;t repeat myself here. On the topic of a van for between $100,000 and $200,000, though, I will say this: as prices for these vehicles climb, do not forget to consider the other rigs ever-higher price points make viable. If you plan to spend $60,000 on a cool van but come to terms with shelling out $200,000 for Sportsmobile&#8217;s beast, take stock of what else that $200,000 might get you before you pull the trigger. At this point you have gotten into <a href="https://earthcruiser.com/">EarthCruiser</a> territory, and as cool as the Sportsmobile Classic may be, I would rather the former.</p>
