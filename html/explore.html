<p>A few days ago Stefan Constantinescu of <a href="http://tabdump.com/">Tab Dump</a> wrote an article titled <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/1/22/making-some-bets"><em>Making Some Bets</em></a>, where he announced his decision to go fully independent and rely on his writing to support himself. The latest in <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/">a</a> string <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/">of</a> similar resolutions, his decision gained a bit of attention, through which I came across <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/2/4/february-04-57-tabs"><em>February 04: 57 tabs</em></a> earlier this morning. The broad range of topics he covers makes for very interesting reading and highlights great articles I would never have found otherwise, but I could get that from any old news reader. Rather, it is the unique format and accompanying succinct summarizations that I find so compelling about Stefan&#8217;s new daily venture, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt that he includes enough articles to keep me set for a day or two, at least, with each installment. I really like this new thing Stefan decided to do, and I think you will too. Definitely go check it out.</p>

<p>Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist, and Steven Pinker believe nuclear power should replace fossil fuels, and serve as the backup that makes renewable energy sources viable. They make a good case in this interesting article on The New York Times, and I even found a few gems in the comments section&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of which pointed me to a piece on Bloomberg. Gerard Mourou, a winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize for Physics, has a novel idea to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-nuclear-waste-storage-france/">solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal</a>.</p>

<p>These advocates, and the scientists behind them, have many barriers to overcome before their proposal becomes a reality. As they point out in The New York Times&#8217; piece, though, it comes down to using a scary solution to avoid the guaranteed disaster that lies at the end of the path we walk today. If the science works out, we will have to choose between the devil we know, and the imagined one we have built up in our minds over the last half century. I&#8217;ll keep my finger&#8217;s crossed that we make the right choice.</p>

<p>Last week Ben Thompson recommended that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ben-thompson-on-the-future-of-news-and-newspapers.html">anyone who enjoyed his three-part series on the future of news and newspapers</a> check out Nieman Journalism Lab&#8217;s latest report on the state of news media in 2014. For anyone interested, here&#8217;s the link: <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/03/new-technology-new-money-new-newsrooms-old-questions-the-state-of-the-news-media-in-2014/"><em>New technology, new money, new newsrooms, old questions: The State of the News Media in 2014</em></a>; at the time, I was: I promptly saved the essay to Instapaper and eagerly awaited reading it. However, a little more than a week later, I got through the first two paragraphs before completely losing interest. Yet, ten days prior I read more than three thousand words on this subject, spread across three different articles. What changed?</p>
