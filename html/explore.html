<p>As Glenn Fleishman said in the article&#8217;s opening sentence, Marco has indeed had a very busy few weeks lately. I&#8217;m very enthusiastic about the changes Glenn plans to make in the coming weeks and months with the publication of an actual print volume and the advent of a complementary podcast. Until now I haven&#8217;t made time to subscribe despite constantly hearing wonderful things about The Magazine; who knows, maybe this will get me to bite the bullet and spend my summer reading.</p>

<p>I have written about this before, in an article titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/testing-the-apple-tax.html"><em>Testing the Apple Tax</em></a>, and Ben Lovejoy comes to the same conclusion I did in his piece over at 9to5 Mac: in reality, the proposed &#8220;Apple tax&#8221; is, frankly, nearly nonexistent. Taking into account overall build quality, form factor, fit and finish, power, and power consumption, Mac computers compete quite competitively with their PC &#8220;counterparts&#8221;; adding in other factors such as resale value, maintenance, and support, I have a hard time believing anyone could make the reasonable case than any manufacturer offers greater value than Apple. The only part of Ben&#8217;s article that I took issue with was his belief that a five-year-old Windows machine would have any resale value whatsoever: late last year I tried to attain some return on investment for four DELL laptops roughly that old, and as far as anyone was concerned, they were worthless.</p>

<p>Every so often an article crosses my path wherein the author drools over a custom shop&#8217;s awesome modifications to an already awesome vehicle, and then I invariably spend a good long while extricating myself from the inevitable rabbit hole that ensues. As of this writing, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/el-diablo-jeep.html">nearly four months have passed since I have gone down that path</a>, continuing my trend of leaving roughly <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/superhero-vehicles.html">three months</a> between each of these articles. Today, I&#8217;m back for another round: thanks to the rediscovery of three monsters I squirreled away in my Instapaper queue a number of weeks ago, and only just recently rediscovered, I finally have cause to once again spend time appreciating these mechanical marvels at the intersection of industrial design and raw power.</p>
