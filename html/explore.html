<time id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-08 07:25:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/08 07:25:31 EST</time>
<p>Quite some time ago, I started this draft with a simple premise: precluding success is failure of at least one effort in a given area. Put differently, those who have yet to fail in their chosen profession can never attain greatness in that field. Along with this supposition, I included one more stipulation as an addendum to the previous statement: one can, however, substitute knowledge, to a degree, for failure. Regardless of the knowledge amassed relating to a particular skill set or field of study though, the best one can hope for is mediocrity without the essential, formative impact even one failure invariably brings with it. Thus, from these somewhat humble beginnings, I began to craft this article.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apple has set fire to iOS. Everything&#8217;s in flux. Those with the least to lose have the most to gain, because this fall, hundreds of millions of people will start demanding apps for a platform with thousands of old, stale players and not many new, nimble alternatives. If you want to enter a category that&#8217;s crowded on iOS 6, and you&#8217;re one of the few that exclusively targets iOS 7, your app can look better, work better, and be faster and cheaper to develop than most competing apps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I see why this article was at the top of the Hacker News front page. Marco is very hopeful for this fall, and rightly so: iOS 7 does indeed present a rare opportunity for existing markets to be disrupted by brand new entrants. I&#8217;m extremely excited to see what comes next, especially from Marco. We are moving towards a very interesting time; buckle up and hold on.</p>

<p>Wes Siler has some advice for those looking to buy an adventure vehicle. I agree with almost everything he says, even if most of it just applies to those who already have one: get good tires, have a tire repair kit and recovery gear, get advanced driver training, pack less, don&#8217;t try to force an inadequate car into the role of a much more capable one, and understand the difference between AWD and 4WD&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the rest, not so much. He also suggests leasing instead of buying (say goodbye to things like bumpers and roof racks, and don&#8217;t get too adventurous), defaulting to a truck (too large and heavy unless you choose a mid-size pickup, at which point you might as well get an SUV like a 4Runner), and avoiding a Tacoma&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of the most capable off-road trucks in North America&#160;&#8212;&#160;at all costs. Take the good from this piece and ignore the bad. I plan to post a guide of my own soon.</p>
