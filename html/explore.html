</h2>
<time id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-10 18:59:04-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/10 18:59:04 EST</time>
<p>Over the last few days I have received a ton of great feedback on both a number of my articles and my site&#8217;s design as well. While the former has remained consistently positive, the latter refrain almost invariably included the same two criticisms: that I had set the font too small, and that every line contained too many words spread much too far across the screen for a comfortable reading experience. Others recommended that I find a way to differentiate linked list items from my own posts, but by and large the most common suggestion advocated a larger font size and decreased content column width. Today, I have addressed those issues and many others with my latest redesign, live with this article.</p>

<p>Nice to finally have some closure on this subject. I never got into Flappy Bird&#160;&#8212;&#160;I never even downloaded the game&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I couldn&#8217;t help but get sucked into the &#8220;discussion&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use that term loosely here&#160;&#8212;&#160;around the game, especially after its creator took Flappy Bird down at the peak of its popularity. I wish him good luck in the future; he has been remarkably blessed, and I have no doubt he will make good use of that good fortune.</p>

<p>Stories like this one from Craig Grannell remind me why I have been so reticent to enter the political landscape in any meaningful capacity up until now, a hesitancy <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/net-neutrality-wake-call/">I outlined when linking to Ben Thompson&#8217;s recent piece</a> in which he called for greater political involvement for those in the technical professions. Everyone promises peace and to bring the soldiers home, but that will never happen: wars will forever wage on, and someone will always need stopped. The key difference between Craig&#8217;s story and reality, though, is not the tactics or actions of the system&#8217;s participants, but rather the end result when they invariably and inevitably fail to fulfill their promises: whereas his classmates held him and his cohorts accountable on the schoolyard, modern-day citizens&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Americans in particular, it seems&#160;&#8212;&#160;have no interest in holding anyone accountable for the promises on which they renege.</p>
