<p>Virtually every time Dan Benjamin is interviewed, the host eventually asks the same question posed by numerous interviewers of days gone by: &#8220;When people ask what you do, what do you tell them?&#8221; And every time, Dan answers the same way, saying that his answer depends on the person asking. For some, Dan responds that he is in broadcasting and leaves it at that; in other cases he goes in to more detail, qualifying that statement by describing his podcast network. He chooses his answer based on the level to which that person would understand his explanation, because as Dan has said each time in response to the aforementioned question, there are some people that still don&#8217;t know what podcasts are.</p>

<p>Turns out you are not the only one battling with a lack of conviction in your own self worth and the value of the things you create, and struggling with the fear that at any moment someone might discover that you are, in fact, the fraud you so strongly believe yourself to be. In reality, we all struggle with these complicated feelings&#160;&#8212;&#160;you, me, and I would bet anything your role model does as well. In the somber words of <a href="http://the-blacklist.wikia.com/wiki/Raymond_Reddington">Raymond Reddington</a> though, &#8220;There will be nightmares. And every day when you wake up, it will be the first thing you think about. Until one day, it will be the second thing.&#8221; Although at the time he referred to something much darker than the purely psychological impostor syndrome, his words apply here as well: these misgivings will plague you from the moment you wake up <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/02/20/om">in the middle of the night</a> to the second you fall back into a fitful sleep. Until one day, they will not.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-european-diesel-cars/">a simple question</a>: Why does Europe have ultra efficient diesel vehicles, but America does not? I had heard the claims, that some European diesels get up to 80 miles per gallon&#160;&#8212;&#160;yet those in North America eek 50. I had a hunch, that <a href="https://dougdemuro.kinja.com/here-s-why-we-can-t-buy-that-80-mpg-diesel-we-rented-in-1325972764">stringent EPA rules forced auto makers to sell second-rate vehicles in the United States</a>, but I had to know for sure.  </p>
