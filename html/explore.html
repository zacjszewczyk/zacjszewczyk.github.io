<time id='article_time' datetime="2020-02-12 17:05:13-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2020.html">2020</a>/<a href="/blog/2020-02.html">02</a>/12 17:05:13 EST in <a href='/tech.html'>Tech</a></time>
<p>This is such a cool idea: Denis Shiryaev used Gigapixel AI&#8217;s neural network to upscale a classif video from 1896 into 4k; as Timothy Bee <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/someone-used-neural-networks-to-upscale-a-famous-1896-video-to-4k-quality/">points out</a>, a similar approach could then add color.  </p>

<p>One of my long-term projects involves making the small part of the internet I use every day available offline. As I <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">lean</a> toward a more nomadic lifestyle, I may not always have ready access to the familiar shows I stream on Netflix, for example, or that one news article from a few weeks ago. A single hard drive could store everything I have ever watched, read, and listened to, though, and so I want to make that happen. This goes well with one of my other long-term projects, which involves curating evergreen digital media for posterity&#8217;s sake. Think of the former as every movie I have ever watched, and the latter as the classics I want to save for my kids. There are many <a href="https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/which-compression-format-to-use-for-archiving/">subltle challenges</a> to this, but none so obvious as the fact that even video from a few years ago looks bad on modern displays. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/someone-used-neural-networks-to-upscale-a-famous-1896-video-to-4k-quality/">Denis&#8217;s demonstration</a> gives me hope that this may not always be the case.</p>

<p>I took over a team in June, and like Dwight, I have more than one priority. We have our mission and all the tasks it entails, but on my own time, I decided to also encourage my Solders to take an active role in their personal development. This involved a long write-up, a detailed plan, and a list of many books, articles, and projects to guide their study. Those will make their way here in time, but for now, I want to highlight some of the gems I re-discovered as part of this process&#160;&#8212;&#160;starting with <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/"><em>Writing vs writing</em></a>, by Shawn Blanc.  </p>

<p>I used to read everything <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a> wrote, and this piece from 2011 reminded me why. Writing is hard, and the people who don&#8217;t think so either haven&#8217;t written enough, or haven&#8217;t written well enough, to understand this.</p>

<time id='article_time' datetime="2014-08-25 07:59:48-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-08.html">08</a>/25 07:59:48 EST in <a href='/uncategorized.html'>Uncategorized</a></time>
<p>Here on this website, I predominantly write about technology: Apple, iOS, the web, code, and the like in a mixture of original articles and link posts. I also put together a weekly collection of excellent podcasts that I, quite creatively, dubbed &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221;. Roughly once a month I write about cabins too, and every so often talk about outdoor gear. The vast majority of the pieces I publish here, however, are at least tangentially related to technology. So if today you have come here looking for one of these articles, perhaps one where I hypothesize as to the future of podcasts or Apple&#8217;s next operating system, you might as well leave now: today I will touch on none of those topics, for I have sat down to, for the first time in quite a while, talk about myself. Myself, and my future.</p>
