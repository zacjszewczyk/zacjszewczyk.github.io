<p>Over the past two weeks my usage of the iPad as a device for both content consumption and creation has exploded: whereas before I had used the iPad primarily to read textbooks with the occasional deviation into other forms of reading, I now use the iPad as my primary computing device. Despite the occasional inconvenience this approach presents, forcing me to return to my computer for one thing or another from time to time, I have done so less often than I thought I would, and it happens increasingly infrequently as I spend more time perfecting a new workflow. And that&#8217;s strange for me, as an avid programmer, writer, and occasional gamer, to discover.</p>

<time id='article_time' datetime="2013-04-09 10:24:36-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-04.html">04</a>/09 10:24:36 EST</time>
<p>I have always had an interesting&#160;&#8212;&#160;if not unique&#160;&#8212;&#160;mentality when it comes to money. Rather than a thing to be desired, I have always considered money merely a means to an end. The physical thing is only worth possessing inasmuch as it allows me to do fun and enjoyable things with people I like. When I take my girlfriend out for dinner, I don&#8217;t see the twenty dollars I spend on a meal as the loss of that money; I see that twenty dollars as paying for a delightful evening spent with a girl I enjoy being with and really like. Or consider the days I take my siblings to the frozen yogurt shop down the street from my house. One of the last times I took them, my sister tried to pay. It was a nice gesture and good that she did, but it is not her responsibility, at twelve, to pay for her own food; I was there and fully capable of buying our yogurt, which I did. I exchanged somewhere in the ballpark of ten dollars for a delicious bowl of frozen yogurt with my sister. I did not lose that money; to me, it was an acceptable trade in which I certainly got the better part of the deal.</p>

<p>I have talked before about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/git-home.html">some of the aliases I use in my development environment</a>, and how these and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/pushing-to-multiple-repos.html">other little tricks</a> make my life just a bit easier. Victor Zhou wrote a neat post about his aliases, and about while they don&#8217;t save him much time in the end, they make his life a little easier, too.</p>
