                &lt;p&gt;Quite some time ago I came across Jeffrey Way&amp;#8217;s article &lt;a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/editorials/publishers-dont-restrict-writers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publishers: Don&amp;#8217;t Restrict Writers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and added it to my Instapaper queue more out of curiosity at an article posted on Nettuts+ not about programming than anything else. Nearly a month prior, I had read an article on Ben Brooks&amp;#8217; website called &lt;a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/11/self-publishing/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-Publishing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which he said something I found very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I have an innate distrust of all writing advice that seem to come from a large organization. I blame academia, for all those years I spent years reading and writing the most rigid, boring prose known to man. I &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-writing.html"&gt;prefer&lt;/a&gt; advice &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-turn-offs.html"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; actual &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tbt-writing-vs-writing.html"&gt;writers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;and that&amp;#8217;s what I found in Harry Guinness&amp;#8217;s recent article for The New York Times, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-edit-your-own-writing.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Edit Your own Writing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He offers some great advice, and makes some excellent book recommendations. To add to that list, I also recommend William Zinsser&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;On Writing Well&lt;/em&gt;, and Stephen King&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;On Writing&lt;/em&gt;: Harry&amp;#8217;s books focus on the mechanics, while these concern themselves with the craft.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Mozilla&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://drewdevault.com/2017/12/16/Firefox-is-on-a-slippery-slope.html"&gt;mistakes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;although &lt;a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/mozilla-is-becoming-evil-be-careful-with-firefox.html"&gt;concerning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;worry me less than Google&amp;#8217;s methodical Internet takeover. Indulge me while I bring the uninformed up to speed: after eviscerating its competitors, over half the Internet now uses Chrome. This dominance gives its creator the power to force sweeping change across this decentralized system: although superficially optional, failure to comply means longer load times, lower search ranking, and lost revenue. Over the last few years in particular, the company has shown an increased willingness to wield that power with more and more aggressive mandates. Publishers who do not expose their content through Accelerated Mobile Pages &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-set-list/google-amp-a-70-drop-in-our-conversion-rate-35fe3cb69c59"&gt;lose viewers and income&lt;/a&gt;. Users who prefer other browsers, &lt;a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/is-google-evil.html"&gt;perhaps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/"&gt;because they value their privacy&lt;/a&gt;, either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"&gt;cannot access many of Google&amp;#8217;s popular services, or have to live with a degraded user experience&lt;/a&gt;. It all leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So while I find Mozilla&amp;#8217;s mistakes concerning, I like the thought of supporting Chrome even less, so I decided to give &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; another try.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Ian Eyberg in &lt;a href="https://rap.mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Containers are Not the Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, quoting a line from &lt;a href="https://rap.mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm"&gt;Mike Rapoport and James Bottomley&amp;#8217;s talk at this year&amp;#8217;s Free and Open source Software Developers&amp;#8217; European Meeting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The kernel developers view of the docker community is that in the rare case they can actually formulate the question correctly they usually don&amp;#8217;t understand the answer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious. Ian also got at a critical point about the state of modern software engineers, something I touched on a few weeks ago when I linked to &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good TImes Create Weak Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Short-term, push-button fixes attempt to get around the long, hard, and expensive problem of developing and deploying expertise. Like outsourcing, while the former approach has &lt;a href="http://berthub.eu/articles/posts/national-outsourcing/"&gt;short-term benefits&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9da/f5cc1c94c6e34e29095ca168e8fa2d750df9.pdf"&gt;long-term effects are debilitating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As I read through &lt;a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2013/01/mechanical-transmission-of-power-stangenkunst.html"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and then, later, parts &lt;a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2013/02/the-mechanical-transmission-of-power-jerker-line-systems.html"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2013/03/the-mechanical-transmission-of-power-3-wire-ropes.html"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; of Kris De Decker&amp;#8217;s interesting series on mechanical power transmission, I knew I had read other articles from the Low-Tech Magazine before. A quick check through my archive proved me right: for those looking for other interesting reads on low-tech solutions to hard problems, check out &lt;a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/01/how-sustainable-is-a-solar-powered-website.html"&gt;How Sustainable is a Solar Powered Website?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet/"&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Internet&lt;/a&gt;, too, or any of &lt;a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/"&gt;The Low-Tech Magazine&amp;#8217;s other fascinating work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, check out &lt;a href="http://507movements.com/"&gt;507 Movements&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;get this&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;507 different mechanical mechanisms. When I run into &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/projects.html#caddProjects"&gt;a novel engineering challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I always try to solve it in a simple mechanical way first. Computers are great, but there is a certain elegance to simple machinery for which I have great appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/projects.html#firstCrack"&gt;don&amp;#8217;t like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html"&gt;dependencies&lt;/a&gt;, but excusing one language&amp;#8217;s reliance on bucketloads of them because others use built-in libraries misses the point. I care about the number of dependencies I have to install just for your project. On a system full of libraries that could have met most of those requirements, as evidenced by other, similar projects that do not need hundreds of extra packages, the fact that yours does gives me pause. The fact that this language seems to cause this leads me to believe some fundamental shortcoming must exist. Let&amp;#8217;s not excuse that.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I took two weeks off work around Christmas. I spent the first touring Arizona, and the second at my parents&amp;#8217; farm in Ohio. After a 605lb deadlift PR in early December, I felt like a break from the gym. Plus, I did not workout for the three weeks I spent driving up the east coast in 2018. Gym access did not factor into this trip&amp;#8217;s planning process either, and so over those fifteen days, I worked out three times. Today, I want to share some thoughts about fitness on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I love stories like &lt;a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html"&gt;Adam&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;. Too many people propose complex solutions to simple problems because they get excited about building something cool, and lose sight of their actual purpose: building a useful tool. I see this all the time at work. In this case, another developer used a Big Data approach for a Small Data problem, and Adam shows how a much simpler&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;but less cool(?)&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;one would have got it done much, much faster. Had this other developer &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/good-times-create-weak-men.html"&gt;understood the underlying technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and taken some time for &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/linear-python.html"&gt;premature optimization&lt;/a&gt;, he might have gotten there himself.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;The Economist took an interesting look at how citizens view politicians when they lie, and their conclusion warrants concern: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You might expect (or hope) that thoughtful people would be more amenable to the force of fact-based evidence than most. Alas, no. According to David Perkins of Harvard University, the brighter people are, the more deftly they can conjure up post-hoc justifications for arguments that back their own side.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads well into a point Ryan Holiday made back in March, in &lt;a href="https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Not Enough to Be Right&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;You Also Have to Be Kind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There is this unshakeable assumption that if they can just present the right fact[, ...] that people will change their minds. ... After spending years and millions of words and hours of video on this, we&amp;#8217;ve had almost zero success. Why? Because you can&amp;#8217;t reason people out of positions they didn&amp;#8217;t reason themselves into. No one responds well to having their identity attacked. No argument made in bad faith&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;that the person on the other side is a moron or a dupe or a racist or a snowflake&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;is ever going to be received in good faith.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sooner this becomes not just common knowledge, but also common practice, the sooner we can move beyond petty divisions and focus on &lt;a href="https://dchhaddendum.libsyn.com/ep7-hardcore-history-on-fire"&gt;steering the empire from total collapse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Check out the original article &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2589345-an-income-portfolio-high-income-and-capital-preservation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

This story reminded me of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvm3z5/rich-rebuilds-tesla-repair-and-salvage"&gt;Rich Benoit rebuilding his own Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. When I want to get away from my screen I stick with woodworking for the most part, but I would love to get into this sort of work. I can &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/projects.html#sleepingPlatform"&gt;build out my car&lt;/a&gt;, but I would love to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Joe Jackson has some good tips for better camp kitchens. I like to keep everything for cooking, eating, and cleaning in one container, packed at all times. I keep a second one empty for dry goods. This makes trip prep a breeze: I just load the first tote in my car, then fill up the second tote and my cooler in the grocery store&amp;#8217;s parking lot on my way out of town. Along with &lt;a href="http://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/furniture/tables/regular-dining-table"&gt;two dining tables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B001QC31G6"&gt;two water jugs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/projects.html#sleepingPlatform"&gt;my storage system&lt;/a&gt;, this setup makes cooking tough meals easy, and eating them fun.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I wanted to get into this &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html"&gt;when I explained why you should manage your own website&lt;/a&gt;, but that got a little long and this topic deserves its own post. I have talked before about &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html"&gt;my setup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/projects.html#firstCrack"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt;, First Crack, but today I want to explain how I run my site, so that you can run yours. &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20362319#20363104"&gt;I agree&lt;/a&gt; that most technical people underestimate the difficulty of setting up a website, and so today I will make that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In an article I will post soon, I mention the difference between smart and intelligent people. I have seen this explained in more ways than I can count, but none the way I define it. Rather than burying this in an already long piece, I want to talk about it here so that I can flesh it out and then cite it later.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I have an article in the works on a similar topic, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight this piece by one of my favorite new writers, &lt;a href="http://blairreeves.me/"&gt;Blair Reeves&lt;/a&gt;, before I reference it there. He makes some great points about the value of blogging, even if you have no intention of ever turning it into a revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I came across this story thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/22/6053213/pokemon-black-creepypasta"&gt;Polygon&amp;#8217;s refutation&lt;/a&gt; of the mod&amp;#8217;s existence, but fortunately thought to read &lt;a href="http://tinycartridge.com/post/866743831/super-creepy-pokemon-hack"&gt;the original article&lt;/a&gt; over at Tiny Cartridge first&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;as I would recommend you do as well. &amp;#8220;Creepy&amp;#8221; barely scratches the surface of this haunting tale. Especially if you, like me, grew up loving Pokemon, I encourage you to take a few minutes and read this story; it&amp;#8217;s remarkably well-done.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The idea that one could survive and prosper based on their merits alone is a comforting idea. If this story teaches us anything though, it teaches us that increasingly, it is nothing more than that&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;little more than a comforting notion in a world where mom and dad can open their wallets to make any door spring open before their baby. I signed eight years of my life away in exchange for a four-year education, and while &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/looking-to-the-future.html"&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t regret that decision in the least&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s remarkably disheartening to see others reap similar rewards in exchange for their father&amp;#8217;s signature and a brief &amp;#8220;Thanks.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Very interesting point from Benedict Evans at the tail end of this article, where he points out that Apple&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;decision&lt;/em&gt; not to build a larger phone, and the company&amp;#8217;s decision not to enter the mid- to low-end, place it in a very powerful position going forward as those decisions can be reversed at any time. Much more powerful a position than its competitors, because unlike Apple who possess the ability to ship phones with these capabilities but has thus far deigned not to, others have proven wholly incapable of creating the aspects that make Apple&amp;#8217;s products so valuable. Going forward, that ought to cause a great deal of concern amongst some, while a great deal of hope among others.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In a style made popular by Benedict Evans in his hallmark Twitter postulations, posit: computers were created for writers. As such, the next iteration of computing devices will cater to the needs of others: creators and designers will have Jarvis-like artificial intelligence systems to converse with and holographic interfaces to involve their entire bodies in the creation process. The current model involves the two tools of the writer&amp;#8217;s trade: their hands and their minds. Future implementations will go beyond those unnecessary restrictions that don&amp;#8217;t apply in other fields in order to provide a richer, more productive computing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Yes; fantastic piece from Sid O&amp;#8217;Neill. I myself have begun to wonder the same things lately, questioning how I became so pedantic and obsessed with things of such little real importance that I would wax on endlessly about &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/misunderstood.html"&gt;a simple ad&lt;/a&gt;, of all things. Yet, unlike Sid, I have been able to suppress those uncomfortable questions until very recently. As time marches on, however, and the amount of time I devote to this hobby only grows, this is a very real reality that I must confront. And as for what I will ultimately answer? Time will only tell; were I forced to make a prediction now, though, I would wager I end up on the same side of this issue as Sid.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A remarkably short list for you this week, if it even deserves such a title as &amp;#8220;list&amp;#8221; with only two members. But, nevertheless, it does contain the two best podcast episodes I encountered over the last seven days. So enjoy, and maybe this weekend spend a little less time with headphones in your ears.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Over the past week especially, there has been a fair bit of discussion devoted to podcasting&amp;#8217;s so-called &amp;#8220;Blogger moment&amp;#8221;. In particular, John Gruber and Mike Monteiro discussed this on &lt;a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/80/"&gt;the latest episode of The Talk Show&lt;/a&gt;, and Myke Hurley and Casey Liss spent some time talking about it on &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/96"&gt;CMD+SPACE 96: Not Many Original Thoughts, with Casey Liss&lt;/a&gt; as well. In a nutshell, the idea is that just as Blogger brought blogging to the masses in the early 2000s and consequently caused the medium to explode in popularity, so too will podcasting have a similar moment whereby it breaks through the nerd barrier and goes mainstream. Interestingly, many at the forefront of the podcast medium believe that time to be now. For what reasons they believe this, however, I cannot say.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Education is a topic near and dear to my heart, so whenever I can find an interesting, well-written article on the subject I tend to afford it slightly more attention than I might Business Insider&amp;#8217;s terrible article explaining possible reasons behind Facebook&amp;#8217;s acquisition of Oculus. Unfortunately, these articles often turn out mediocre at best; this piece by Clay Shirky, however, and its predecessor &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Napster, Udacity, and the Academy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are both very interesting in-depth looks at the problems facing higher education in America. You will have to spend a while reading both of these, but it will be time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Fascinating look at the percentage of household income various countries spend on groceries each year. Surprisingly, that number has steadily decreased over the past thirty years. In response to Businessweek&amp;#8217;s chart, on display at the beginning of The Typist&amp;#8217;s article, The Atlantic wrote &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/cheap-eats-how-america-spends-money-on-food/273811/"&gt;a great, in-depth piece&lt;/a&gt; taking the discussion a few steps farther. Even if you only have a passing interest in this subject, I encourage you to check these articles out; great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning at three o&amp;#8217;clock, I will wake up three hours earlier than normal; within sixty minutes of getting out of bed, I will be on my way to the Pittsburgh International Airport; five hours after awakening&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;if all goes well, and weather permitting&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;my plane will take off bound for the Bahamian island of San Salvador where I will reside for a week as part of a geology class I enrolled in at the beginning of this semester. After several weeks of in-class study, this trip will allow my class and I to gain valuable field experience&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;hence the class title, &amp;#8220;Field Investigative Geology&amp;#8221;. Because I will go San Salvador with the express purpose of gaining field experience, due to the research center&amp;#8217;s isolated and somewhat dated nature, and as a result of the island&amp;#8217;s location far outside of America&amp;#8217;s borders, I will have no way of accessing the internet from Wednesday morning until the following Friday. As a courtesy to all my readers, then, rather than simply going off-grid for an entire week without notice, I just wanted to take a moment and give you a heads-up.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I have a very light issue for you this month, unfortunately: precious little caught my eye over the past few weeks. In fact, just two articles did, and only one came from Cabin Porn: a &lt;a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/77427808607/3rd-generation-hand-made-family-cabin-on-the-upper"&gt;third-generation hand-made cabin from Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. This structure, to me, defines the genre: built of wood and stone and out in the middle of the woods, not some modern architecture retrofitted into a rustic getaway a few hundred feet from the nearest road, this cabin has &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt;. And I love that about it.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Great look at the industry&amp;#8217;s leading font providers, Hoefler &amp;#38; Frere-Jones, Typekit, and Google Fonts, made all the more valuable because now I won&amp;#8217;t have to shell out $150 to ultimately go back to Google Fonts in the end. In a sense, as light bulbs are to Marco Arment, so too are fonts to The Typist in this article. Also worth noting with regards to Google&amp;#8217;s offering is that in addition to making an ever-expanding library of fonts available for the attractive price of free, the ubiquity of these fonts over the more expensive options from H&amp;#38;FJ and Typekit makes caching and, thus, decreased load times something to consider as well.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A few days ago I wrote &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/algorithmic-ineptitude.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algorithmic Ineptitude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where I took Hacker News, Digg, and Reddit to task for recommending articles based on flawed algorithms rather than employing humans to perform the same task in a much better way. That same day I found a post by Alex Turnbull of Groove talking about his team&amp;#8217;s efforts to game Hacker News. Although his well-researched, reasonable methodology ultimately failed, its existence highlights a huge shortcoming in this service to actually bring good content to the attention of its users, and I highly doubt Hacker News is the only site creators have gamed in exchange for pageviews and thus increased revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Rather than asking &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://harshilshah1910.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/yahoo-marissa-mayer-techpinions/"&gt;Is Yahoo Even Worth Trying To Save?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;, a more apropos question would ask not if Yahoo! was worth rescuing, but instead if Marissa Mayer&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;or anyone, for that matter&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; actually keep the company afloat, for to operate under the assumptions imposed by the latter would be to approach this issue from the wrong direction entirely. As Harshil Shah points out in his aforecited article, Steve Jobs managed a drastic course correction of the caliber needed at Yahoo! when he made his triumphant return after the floundering Apple purchased NeXT. With that notable exception, no one else in recent history has successfully conducted such a significant change. To use that anomalous revival in support of the argument that Marissa Mayer could, if her company warranted salvation, save Yahoo!, however, does not take into account the very distinct differences between Apple of the late 1990s and the Yahoo! of today.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Hat-tip to Shawn Blanc for &lt;a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/for-the-love-of-money/"&gt;the original link&lt;/a&gt;, former hedge-fund manager Sam Polk talks about his amazing journey from addict college dropout to making nearly four million dollars in a single bonus, to say nothing of his base salary and any other dividends accrued throughout the year. If you, like me and so many others, have ever thought, &amp;#8220;If I could just win the lottery, think of all the great things I could do; all the problems that money would solve&amp;#8221;, you ought to read this; even if you have never thought that, you should still read this. It&amp;#8217;s an incredible and harrow story of wealth, greed, and, ultimately, redemption.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I decided to start this article in response to &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LinusEdwards/status/423245321142304768"&gt;a remark Linus Edwards made&lt;/a&gt; saying that although a tech blogger, he felt like a bad one given his lack of knowledge regarding the intricacies of RSS, which prevented him from keeping an accurate record of those subscribers. I faced a similar problem shortly after launching this site, but solved it soon afterwards. As they say though, every day someone comes into the world having never seen the Flintstones. Today I thought I would take some time to explain how I go about doing what I do here in the hopes that it will save someone time, energy, and frustration in the future, or just make their life a little bit easier through a new app or service they had previously never heard of. Before I can get into the nitty-gritty details of back-end sites and services though, I must provide a frame of reference by talking about the front-end devices and apps I use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co"&gt;Josh Ginter&lt;/a&gt; responded to my article &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doing Monetization Well&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a very thoughtful &lt;a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/cashing-in-the-blog"&gt;post of his own&lt;/a&gt;. To no great surprise on my part, he questioned the viability of sponsorships at my low threshold of just 2,000 visitors per month. I expected someone would, and I can not fault Josh for doing so: I picked such low numbers on purpose because I wanted to have tangible, achievable goals I felt some confidence in my ability to attain. Even if I only get ten or fifteen dollars a months, that will cover hosting and take this from a cost center to a profitable venture, while simultaneously setting me on the path to further monetization down the road as my readership continues to expand. In my eyes, that&amp;#8217;s a win.&lt;/p&gt;

However, when he decided to put his own post together, I chose to forgo mine until he published his. As it turns out, I did the right thing: reading &lt;em&gt;The Hard Way&lt;/em&gt; earlier this afternoon, it was as if I had written it myself. Linus covered all the points I would have and even told a story that could have just as easily fit my experience working to drive traffic towards my work. All in all, an excellent retrospective and a great starting point for anyone thinking of launching their own website.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Last night I &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-coin.html"&gt;took Coin to task&lt;/a&gt; for extending their pre-order sale, again, in to the new year rather than allowing it to expire as should have happened sometime today. I briefly explained how this move has further devalued their product by virtually solidifying it at the $50 price point, and then talked about how Coin&amp;#8217;s latest escapade showed a startling lack of respect for the individuals who put their hard-earned cash on the line so that this company could fulfill its one job in life by making a great device. Unlike the causes behind the former though, which I could explain with relatively simple examples, the latter&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;distilling the relationship between maker and consumer&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;proved much more difficult. I touched on this topic in &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html"&gt;my past&lt;/a&gt; articles &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html"&gt;on Coin&lt;/a&gt;, but have not actively sought to fully flesh out my thoughts on this topic until now.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I feel a bit like a broken record at this point, what with having already talked about Coin &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but the company&amp;#8217;s latest stunt bears once again picking up my banner and going back off to war: earlier this evening, via their Twitter account, Coin posted a &amp;#8220;BREAKING NEWS!&amp;#8221; announcement that&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;you guessed it&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;extended the $50 off early adopter deal into the new year. Surprised? You should&amp;#8217;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I love overachievers in the world of cars much more than in person, hence my unbridled enthusiasm when &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/superhero-vehicles.html"&gt;I happened across&lt;/a&gt; Mercedes&amp;#8217; six-wheeled monster the G63 AMG and Ghe-O&amp;#8217;s indomitable Rescue. Something about these &lt;em&gt;trucks&lt;/em&gt;, for their rugged ability to tackle literally any terrain imaginable truly epitomizes the colloquial definition of the term&lt;sup id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, awakens a visceral desire to pack my backpack and spend a long weekend trekking through uninhabited back country with nothing but my thoughts to keep my company; they ignite within me a base midwestern American desire to go outside and spend time in nature. Unsurprisingly, then, Filson&amp;#8217;s Jeep 4x4 was no exception. My only hesitation in pushing its limits on a narrow mountain trail would be that I tarnish its carefully crafted exterior and spoil the bespoke interior; once I got past that though, I have no doubt it could handle anything I decided to throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t mean to go on a rant, but as a brief aside I do not understand the appeal of such small trucks. I can see the place of cars, vans, SUVs, and F-150-esq trucks in the jobs consumers hire vehicles to do, but when it comes to these small &amp;#8220;trucks&amp;#8221; I am at a loss. Granted, their perpetuated existence indicates continued demand for such a form factor, but I can&amp;#8217;t for the life of my understand its appeal. Perhaps this is the naivety of youth and machismo of a nineteen-year-old speaking, but if I had the need for a flat bed and an additional four miles to each gallon without the bulk of an F-150 or above&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;the only reasons I could see someone purchasing one of these vehicles&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;I would swallow my second and third criteria and buy a Ford F-series anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id='fn1'&gt;&lt;a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;As opposed to the dinky Ford Rangers that have somehow managed to subsume the moniker.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I love The Verge&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;I really do. Not long after posting &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credibility and Bullies with Blogs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where I took Josh Topolsky to task for his wholly inappropriate reaction to many justifiable criticisms regarding his publication&amp;#8217;s device reviews, I subscribed to The Verge. Today it not only serves as my primary news source, but I also follow The Vergecast and tune in for their live coverage of Apple&amp;#8217;s events. Lately, however, I have been increasingly disappointed with their work.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, however, we find that despite possessing identical processors, the Air will outperform the Mini as many suspected it would leading up to last month&amp;#8217;s event.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Number ten, Tonya Lavel&amp;#8217;s, and the eleventh, David Pepper&amp;#8217;s, were reasonably good. With those two exceptions though, these were almost universally both terrible and utterly hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;My introduction to this article, and the piece I personally found more interesting, was &lt;a href="http://tumblr.caseyliss.com/post/61297839809"&gt;the response Casey Liss wrote&lt;/a&gt;. As I read both articles, I thought of something Patrick McKenzie said quite some time ago in &lt;a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Call Yourself a Programmer, and Other Career Advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with.&amp;#8221; While Patrick said that in reference to the perception of one&amp;#8217;s own skill set, it is just as applicable here.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;In an excellent article posted to The Verge earlier this afternoon Casey Newton made the point I intended to discuss this evening almost as an aside near the end of his article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Apple could also let users log in to other apps and services using a fingerprints, providing secure authentication into apps and websites with a couple of taps. If biometric solutions become widely adopted, the tech industry could begin to phase out&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;or at least augment&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;the flawed, familiar password.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Passbook in iOS 6, Apple began handling important personal information such as credit card numbers, boarding passes, and gift cards. A few months ago in June, when  the company announced iCloud Keychain, it expanded that domain to include passwords, but only on the Mac platform. Before too long&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;hopefully prior to iOS 8&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;I foresee Apple marrying these two technologies with Touch ID on iOS to give users the ability to not only unlock their phone with a fingerprint, but login to websites and apps with that same technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touch ID in its current form is a technology in its infancy; it will take time before we see the full potential of the groundbreaking feature, and perhaps even longer before we realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I could write an entire article proposing improvements to the new website alone, let alone the aging app. But this article isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about Instapaper&amp;#8217;s website, nor is it &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about the app; this article is about Instapaper the read it later service and what Betaworks can do to revolutionize this beloved platform upon its next milestone release.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Wednesday evening, news broke that Apple had removed The Omni Group&amp;#8217;s iOS app &lt;em&gt;OmniKeyMaster&lt;/em&gt; for facilitating upgrade pricing, a feature Apple has refused to build in to the App Store since its launch. Amidst the &lt;a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/09/omni-app-store/"&gt;vocal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/on-omnikeymasters-shutdown/"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; for change in Apple&amp;#8217;s long-standing policies, I remembered something Marco Arment said on an episode of &lt;em&gt;Build &amp;#38; Analyze&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ability to disable Control Center while using apps. The feature previously worked no matter where you were in iOS 7. Now you can select to have it turned off whenever an app is open. It can also be disabled on the lock screen.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately upon reading this it struck me how very strange it is for Apple, notorious for choosing the one experience it considers best and enforcing it with a hard and unyielding hand, to give its users control over such a major feature in iOS 7. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised to see the setting gone by the next beta release.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I have always had great trouble starting to write. I seldom found the actual act of writing difficult, only getting started. The same goes for programming: once I had successfully implemented the main functionality I set out to imbue First Crack with, I ceased iterating on the project not for lack of new ideas&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;with the underlying code functional and working, I wanted to design an accompanying GUI, for example&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;but instead because I lacked the drive to approach such a monumental task. I was burned out, I suppose, tired after working on the same project for months and months, and stuck in a linkblog rut when it came to writing.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;With the minor caveat of having drawn its entire inspiration solely from one of the most unintelligible and idiotic videos I have ever seen, &lt;a href="http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/"&gt;Jon Negroni&amp;#8217;s theory&lt;/a&gt; that all Pixar movies not only take place within the same world but also serve to establish a connected timeline is nevertheless a very interesting one. Like most conspiracy theories, Jon&amp;#8217;s proposition makes use of many seemingly related happenstances and strings them together in to a plausible proposition, which he then offered up as a work-in-progress theory.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Copying iOS 7 is going to be a big problem for cheap hardware. iOS 7&amp;#8217;s appearance and dynamics require a powerful GPU and advanced, finely tuned, fully hardware-accelerated graphics and animation APIs. This will hurt web imitators most, but it&amp;#8217;s also going to be problematic for Android: while high-end Android phones have mostly caught up in GPU performance, and recent Android versions have improved UI acceleration, most Android devices sold are neither high-end nor up-to-date.&amp;#8221; - Marco Arment in  &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/27/ios7-as-defense"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 7 As Defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Craig Hockenberry made the same point in episode forty-six of John Gruber&amp;#8217;s The Talk Show around minute 35:40.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;Wonderfully worded and impressively well thought-out, Matt Gemmel&amp;#8217;s article &lt;em&gt;iOS 7&lt;/em&gt; is easily the best piece on the topic I have read since the WWDC keynote address. In explaining the motivation behind Apple&amp;#8217;s complete UI overhaul in iOS7, he began his one-two punch with this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The thing is, we&amp;#8217;ve grown up. We don&amp;#8217;t require hand-holding to tell us what to click or tap. Interactivity is a matter of invitation, and physical cues are only one specific type. iOS 7 is an iOS for a more mature consumer, who understands that digital surfaces are interactive, and who doesn&amp;#8217;t want anything getting in the way of their content.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, following up, he said something &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/anti-ios-7-anger.html"&gt;curiously familiar&lt;/a&gt; before moving on with the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The basic functionality hasn&amp;#8217;t changed. You still use iOS in the same way, and almost everything is where you expect it to be. The same gestures work. There are a few differences here and there - it&amp;#8217;s a major new version of the OS, after all - but the changes are mostly aesthetic. You won&amp;#8217;t be confused by iOS 7 if you&amp;#8217;re accustomed to a previous version.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I try to, for the most part, stay positive when I write on here. Instead of taking a page out of Jim Dalrymple&amp;#8217;s play book, not that there is anything wrong with his approach, and calling shenanigans and bullshit when I see shenanigans and bullshit, I try to &amp;#8220;take the high road&amp;#8221; and either ignore bad writing and poorly-formed opinions altogether, or criticize them generously. In the wake of the iOS 7 announcement though, many people have said things that I consider&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;quite frankly&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;stupid, especially concerning iOS 7&amp;#8217;s overhauled interface.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Although I make it a point not to spend much time talking about my personal life on this blog, it occasionally creeps in to my writing in the form of an anecdote, perhaps, or the inspiration for an entire article. A few weeks before Christmas last year, I linked to an article by Jason Snell titled &lt;a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2018600/why-im-writing-on-the-ipad.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why I&amp;#8217;m Writing on the iPad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which he talked about a time when he was forced to write using a pen and paper rather than on a computer. In &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-on-the-ipad.html"&gt;my brief article linking to that piece&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about a six month period during which I kept a journal for a person very near and dear to my heart. I happened across that article a few minutes ago in the process of writing a new piece, and this paragraph struck a chord:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Writing about writing has always held great interest for me. That&amp;#8217;s why, when I saw Shawn Blanc&amp;#8217;s article &lt;a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/05/the-root-of-non-writing/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Root of Non-Writing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pop up in Reeder earlier this afternoon, I read it, saved it to Instapaper, and then read it again. I love metawriting.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With each paragraph you write, double the amount of time you spend editing. It&amp;#8217;s not just grammar and spelling errors that might be hurting your credibility. Is your point clear, literate, and concise? Have you pruned aggressively to find the core of what you&amp;#8217;re saying? With each additional paragraph, the higher the chance becomes that you&amp;#8217;ve made an egregious mistake that might make your email confusing and forgettable.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No one wants to think of themselves as a Luddite, which is part of what makes technological conservatism so insidious. It can color the thinking of the nerdiest among us, even as we use the latest hardware and software and keep up with all the important tech news. The certainty of our own tech savvy can blind us to future possibilities and lead us to reject anything that deviates from the status quo. We are not immune.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not necessarily a representative sample of this great article by John Siracusa, I nevertheless chose this quotation from the piece reminiscent of the Hypercritical episodes of days since passed because, like John&amp;#8217;s epic rants of old, it was just too good to let pass without note or comment.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As I was reading &lt;a href="http://www.elasticspace.com/2013/03/no-to-no-ui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No to NoUI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier, an article ostensibly regarding the state of user interfaces today, Timo Arnall&amp;#8217;s description of &amp;#8220;the cloud&amp;#8221; stuck with me more than anything else from the article. That&amp;#8217;s why, even though I should have picked a more representative sample, I ended up using that as my excerpt when I linked to the piece. Foolhardy or not, I chose this paragraph above all the others:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;On the one hand, I worry that Pixar is making too many sequels. On the other, I&amp;#8217;d love to see another Incredibles movie.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone, somewhere, once said something to the effect of the higher the number the less-good the sequel. Certainly there are some exceptions to that rule&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Toy Story, for example&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;but by and large it has proved a valid hypothesis. Take Cars 2: as much as I wanted to love that movie after the first, I couldn&amp;#8217;t do it. An endless number of examples and counter-examples could be made on both sides of this argument, but I, for one, look forward to anything with Pixar&amp;#8217;s name on it, regardless of whether or not a digit follows it.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Since John Gruber abruptly announced that The Talk Show would move from 5by5 to the Mule Radio Syndicate a few months ago, many have speculated as to the reasons behind this sudden and unexpected split while both John and Dan remained, for the most part, silent. Twitter exploded with questions, theories, and, in some cases, anger; bloggers wrote long articles filled with speculation; Philip Elmer-DeWitt, writing for CNN Money, even entered the conversation with an uncharacteristically unemotional &lt;a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/19/john-gruber-jumps-ship/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for the topic; however, to this day John and Dan are the only two who know the actual cause for the split. Here I will aggregate the most common discussions and the strongest theories in an attempt at discerning the underlying cause for this unfortunate rift, using this topic as a manner through which to discuss the Mule Radio Syndicate of which I have many opinions on. I originally intended to incorporate this discussion into my post &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/5by5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;5by5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but following the announcement that both Hypercritical and Build &amp;#38; Analyze would close their doors before the year&amp;#8217;s end I chose to pause, step back, thank Dan, Marco, and John for the excellent work, and give a brief history of 5by5 and its impact on the podcasting industry. Separating these two articles also gave me the opportunity to fully explore all the possibilities of this unfortunate happenstance.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Emin Gun writing on Hacking Distributed about the impending demise of Google Reader and the farcical backlash that ensued following the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Second, I suspect that the Reader-loving hacker-turned-entrepreneur crowd, which is deeply insecure about its position in society, is perhaps so sensitive because they see this as a sign that Google, and by proxy, the computer industry, values the masses with their dirty mobile devices and effervescent Twitter feeds more than the self-titled &amp;#8216;digital cognescenti&amp;#8217; with their MacBooks and Reader accounts and IFTTT recipes that save noteworthy articles in Evernote or whatever. They want to flex their digital muscle. And to some extent, I sympathize with this. But let&amp;#8217;s call a spade a spade, and let&amp;#8217;s pick something more worthy over which to flex our muscle. My greatest fear is what would happen if Google were to go back on their decision. It will feed the crazed, self-important &amp;#8216;technocrati&amp;#8217; so much that we&amp;#8217;ll be deluged with overblown outrage at every perceived online slight. I know how 2 year olds turn out when they get their way with tamper tantrums.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emin made a lot of great points in his article, my favorite of which was his call for all the people whining and complaining about Google&amp;#8217;s announcement to instead focus their collective energies into making or finding a good alternative to Reader. If you can code, write a script to fetch and parse your favorite feeds; such a challenge would be simple and take a few evenings, at best; if not, there are plenty of alternatives out there. Embrace this change, don&amp;#8217;t fight it.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The thing I realized early on is people are happy to pay for things that are good. Don&amp;#8217;t be afraid to charge for your services. Don&amp;#8217;t be afraid to charge for what you produce. If those people who don&amp;#8217;t want to pay for it want to complain about it, that&amp;#8217;s fine. They don&amp;#8217;t have to buy it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;My problem, if it could even be called that, with my obviously beloved Cabin Porn tumblr is not really a problem as much as a twinge of disappointment I felt as I made my way through all fifty-six pages on the site. I was disappointed because as I neared and eventually surpassed the halfway point, fewer of the cabins were actually that: a cabin; rather, many of the structures featured on Cabin Porn were more akin to small houses than the cozy, generally handcrafted buildings nestled away from civilization I came to the site looking for. It got progressively worse as I approached the final page. Now granted, in recent years the folks at Beaver Brook have gotten much better at this, but it nevertheless left me feeling slightly dissatisfied when I closed page #56.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was living in Florida and I had a nice two-bedroom condominium, a garage, a swimming pool, some tangerine trees outside, a sports car and a Ford van. It wasn&amp;#8217;t really very fulfilling, in the end.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My cabin at Beaver Brook is in a forest that used to be mostly dominated by white pines, the tallest trees in the Eastern United States. The forest was nearly clear cut and the logs were floated down the nearby Delaware River to Philadelphia where they were used as structural beams for buildings and British ships. ... Now, BB&amp;#8217;s trees are mostly 40-50 years old, though I&amp;#8217;m grateful there are still a few old growth trees to remind me of the previous magnificence of this historic forest.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me about this post as I scrolled through &lt;a href="http://freecabinporn.com/"&gt;Cabin Porn&lt;/a&gt; earlier this morning was not the sad story, but the cover of Erik Rutkow&amp;#8217;s book: featuring two cowboys, for lack of a better term, amidst a huge forest of leviathan trees. It saddens me to think that today, we lack both.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After writing my last post, &lt;a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-next-step.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Next Step&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and as I went back to perusing the steady stream of news and articles I proctor throughout the day, I started thinking about the prevalence of the Apple blog. I touched on this briefly in my last article. There&amp;#8217;s a strangely pervasive mentality in the blogosphere these days that in order to be successful, one must do some combination of three things: write about Apple, adopt the linkblog format, and post regularly, the argument being that few companies are as interesting to write about as Apple. For the most part, I agree with these requirements: nobody writes about Microsoft anymore, because Microsoft isn&amp;#8217;t doing anything revolutionary anymore; for the same reason, nobody writes about Samsung or Oracle or Adobe. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean Apple is the only interesting company on the market. As I said in my previous post, Google is doing many of the same things Apple does and receives so much attention for, although granted often to a lesser degree. In fact, Google does even more with their much broader research and development division, leading to the creation of driverless vehicles, augmented reality glasses, and, most recently, an experimental cell network. No other company in the world can claim the same.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An article from Ben Brooks posted in November of last year I had near the middle of my Simplenote list, burried beneath a slew of notes, ideas, and half-baked articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not interested in writing when it&amp;#8217;s not about the writing. iBooks Author is neat, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to learn it - instead I&amp;#8217;ll just &amp;#8220;publish&amp;#8221; the book here as a series of posts, where I know what I am doing (somewhat) and where writing is about writing and not layout, marketing, legal issues, notices, copyrights, glossaries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely agree with his conclusion, as I&amp;#8217;m sure many writers do. That&amp;#8217;s why, in part, I built First Crack: so that once it was working, I didn&amp;#8217;t need to worry about the logistics and nitpicky details of publication. Instead, I could write in an environment in which &amp;#8220;writing is about writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, when I lived in Minnesota, my friend and I split our time between two activities: building robots and building rockets. We built our robots of Legos and our rockets of cardboard and balsa wood. When we weren&amp;#8217;t occupied with one of those endeavors we spent our evenings racing his go-cart around the empty parking lot across from his house, our afternoons building zip lines in his backyard instead of doing the work we were supposed to, and our mornings being homeschooled by our moms. Outside of that relatively small allocation to formalized learning, we were allowed to pursue whatever interested us.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Earlier this morning &lt;a href="http://nicharalambous.com/"&gt;Nic Haralambous&lt;/a&gt; posted an article titled &lt;a href="http://nicharalambous.com/2012/12/03/dont-read-techcrunch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Read TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Within four hours his article had climbed to the #1 spot on the Hacker News home page with 132 points, at which point I found it and, out of curiosity, clicked the link.&lt;/p&gt;
