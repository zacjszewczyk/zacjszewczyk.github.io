<p>A few days ago I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/algorithmic-ineptitude.html"><em>Algorithmic Ineptitude</em></a>, where I took Hacker News, Digg, and Reddit to task for recommending articles based on flawed algorithms rather than employing humans to perform the same task in a much better way. That same day I found a post by Alex Turnbull of Groove talking about his team&#8217;s efforts to game Hacker News. Although his well-researched, reasonable methodology ultimately failed, its existence highlights a huge shortcoming in this service to actually bring good content to the attention of its users, and I highly doubt Hacker News is the only site creators have gamed in exchange for pageviews and thus increased revenue.</p>

<p>Rather than asking &#8220;<a href="http://harshilshah1910.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/yahoo-marissa-mayer-techpinions/">Is Yahoo Even Worth Trying To Save?</a>&#8221;, a more apropos question would ask not if Yahoo! was worth rescuing, but instead if Marissa Mayer&#160;&#8212;&#160;or anyone, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>could</em> actually keep the company afloat, for to operate under the assumptions imposed by the latter would be to approach this issue from the wrong direction entirely. As Harshil Shah points out in his aforecited article, Steve Jobs managed a drastic course correction of the caliber needed at Yahoo! when he made his triumphant return after the floundering Apple purchased NeXT. With that notable exception, no one else in recent history has successfully conducted such a significant change. To use that anomalous revival in support of the argument that Marissa Mayer could, if her company warranted salvation, save Yahoo!, however, does not take into account the very distinct differences between Apple of the late 1990s and the Yahoo! of today.</p>

<p>Hat-tip to Shawn Blanc for <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/for-the-love-of-money/">the original link</a>, former hedge-fund manager Sam Polk talks about his amazing journey from addict college dropout to making nearly four million dollars in a single bonus, to say nothing of his base salary and any other dividends accrued throughout the year. If you, like me and so many others, have ever thought, &#8220;If I could just win the lottery, think of all the great things I could do; all the problems that money would solve&#8221;, you ought to read this; even if you have never thought that, you should still read this. It&#8217;s an incredible and harrow story of wealth, greed, and, ultimately, redemption.</p>

<p>I decided to start this article in response to <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LinusEdwards/status/423245321142304768">a remark Linus Edwards made</a> saying that although a tech blogger, he felt like a bad one given his lack of knowledge regarding the intricacies of RSS, which prevented him from keeping an accurate record of those subscribers. I faced a similar problem shortly after launching this site, but solved it soon afterwards. As they say though, every day someone comes into the world having never seen the Flintstones. Today I thought I would take some time to explain how I go about doing what I do here in the hopes that it will save someone time, energy, and frustration in the future, or just make their life a little bit easier through a new app or service they had previously never heard of. Before I can get into the nitty-gritty details of back-end sites and services though, I must provide a frame of reference by talking about the front-end devices and apps I use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co">Josh Ginter</a> responded to my article <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"><em>Doing Monetization Well</em></a> with a very thoughtful <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/cashing-in-the-blog">post of his own</a>. To no great surprise on my part, he questioned the viability of sponsorships at my low threshold of just 2,000 visitors per month. I expected someone would, and I can not fault Josh for doing so: I picked such low numbers on purpose because I wanted to have tangible, achievable goals I felt some confidence in my ability to attain. Even if I only get ten or fifteen dollars a months, that will cover hosting and take this from a cost center to a profitable venture, while simultaneously setting me on the path to further monetization down the road as my readership continues to expand. In my eyes, that&#8217;s a win.</p>

However, when he decided to put his own post together, I chose to forgo mine until he published his. As it turns out, I did the right thing: reading <em>The Hard Way</em> earlier this afternoon, it was as if I had written it myself. Linus covered all the points I would have and even told a story that could have just as easily fit my experience working to drive traffic towards my work. All in all, an excellent retrospective and a great starting point for anyone thinking of launching their own website.</p>

<p>Last night I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-coin.html">took Coin to task</a> for extending their pre-order sale, again, in to the new year rather than allowing it to expire as should have happened sometime today. I briefly explained how this move has further devalued their product by virtually solidifying it at the $50 price point, and then talked about how Coin&#8217;s latest escapade showed a startling lack of respect for the individuals who put their hard-earned cash on the line so that this company could fulfill its one job in life by making a great device. Unlike the causes behind the former though, which I could explain with relatively simple examples, the latter&#160;&#8212;&#160;distilling the relationship between maker and consumer&#160;&#8212;&#160;proved much more difficult. I touched on this topic in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html">my past</a> articles <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html">on Coin</a>, but have not actively sought to fully flesh out my thoughts on this topic until now.</p>

<p>I love overachievers in the world of cars much more than in person, hence my unbridled enthusiasm when <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/superhero-vehicles.html">I happened across</a> Mercedes&#8217; six-wheeled monster the G63 AMG and Ghe-O&#8217;s indomitable Rescue. Something about these <em>trucks</em>, for their rugged ability to tackle literally any terrain imaginable truly epitomizes the colloquial definition of the term<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, awakens a visceral desire to pack my backpack and spend a long weekend trekking through uninhabited back country with nothing but my thoughts to keep my company; they ignite within me a base midwestern American desire to go outside and spend time in nature. Unsurprisingly, then, Filson&#8217;s Jeep 4x4 was no exception. My only hesitation in pushing its limits on a narrow mountain trail would be that I tarnish its carefully crafted exterior and spoil the bespoke interior; once I got past that though, I have no doubt it could handle anything I decided to throw at it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to go on a rant, but as a brief aside I do not understand the appeal of such small trucks. I can see the place of cars, vans, SUVs, and F-150-esq trucks in the jobs consumers hire vehicles to do, but when it comes to these small &#8220;trucks&#8221; I am at a loss. Granted, their perpetuated existence indicates continued demand for such a form factor, but I can&#8217;t for the life of my understand its appeal. Perhaps this is the naivety of youth and machismo of a nineteen-year-old speaking, but if I had the need for a flat bed and an additional four miles to each gallon without the bulk of an F-150 or above&#160;&#8212;&#160;the only reasons I could see someone purchasing one of these vehicles&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would swallow my second and third criteria and buy a Ford F-series anyways.</p>

Not long after posting <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>, where I took Josh Topolsky to task for his wholly inappropriate reaction to many justifiable criticisms regarding his publication&#8217;s device reviews, I subscribed to The Verge. Today it not only serves as my primary news source, but I also follow The Vergecast and tune in for their live coverage of Apple&#8217;s events. Lately, however, I have been increasingly disappointed with their work.</p>

<p>Yesterday Jason Snell <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/400363769005486080">made an interesting tweet</a> regarding Apple&#8217;s A7 SoC, presumably after reading the MacRumors article <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/12/retina-ipad-mini-has-1-3-ghz-a7-processor-with-5x-better-performance-than-original-mini/"><em>Retina iPad Mini Has 1.3 GHz A7 Processor With 5X the Performance of the Original Mini</em></a>: &#8220;The iPad Air&#8217;s processor is running at 1.39GHz; the iPad mini&#8217;s is clocked down to 1.27GHz.&#8221; Amidst nearly every discussion surrounding the iPad Mini, especially building up to its release earlier today, much of that discourse has lauded synonymous computing power between both devices as enabling those wishing to buy an iPad to make their decision based purely on form factor rather than performance. Today, however, we find that despite possessing identical processors, the Air will outperform the Mini as many suspected it would leading up to last month&#8217;s event.</p>

As I read both articles, I thought of something Patrick McKenzie said quite some time ago in <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"><em>Don&#8217;t Call Yourself a Programmer, and Other Career Advice</em></a>: &#8220;You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with.&#8221; While Patrick said that in reference to the perception of one&#8217;s own skill set, it is just as applicable here.</p>

<p>In an excellent article posted to The Verge earlier this afternoon Casey Newton made the point I intended to discuss this evening almost as an aside near the end of his article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Apple could also let users log in to other apps and services using a fingerprints, providing secure authentication into apps and websites with a couple of taps. If biometric solutions become widely adopted, the tech industry could begin to phase out&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least augment&#160;&#8212;&#160;the flawed, familiar password.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the advent of Passbook in iOS 6, Apple began handling important personal information such as credit card numbers, boarding passes, and gift cards. A few months ago in June, when  the company announced iCloud Keychain, it expanded that domain to include passwords, but only on the Mac platform. Before too long&#160;&#8212;&#160;hopefully prior to iOS 8&#160;&#8212;&#160;I foresee Apple marrying these two technologies with Touch ID on iOS to give users the ability to not only unlock their phone with a fingerprint, but login to websites and apps with that same technology.</p>

<p>Touch ID in its current form is a technology in its infancy; it will take time before we see the full potential of the groundbreaking feature, and perhaps even longer before we realize it.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening, news broke that Apple had removed The Omni Group&#8217;s iOS app <em>OmniKeyMaster</em> for facilitating upgrade pricing, a feature Apple has refused to build in to the App Store since its launch. Amidst the <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/09/omni-app-store/">vocal</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/on-omnikeymasters-shutdown/">calls</a> for change in Apple&#8217;s long-standing policies, I remembered something Marco Arment said on an episode of <em>Build &#38; Analyze</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ability to disable Control Center while using apps. The feature previously worked no matter where you were in iOS 7. Now you can select to have it turned off whenever an app is open. It can also be disabled on the lock screen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately upon reading this it struck me how very strange it is for Apple, notorious for choosing the one experience it considers best and enforcing it with a hard and unyielding hand, to give its users control over such a major feature in iOS 7. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the setting gone by the next beta release.</p>

<p>I have always had great trouble starting to write. I seldom found the actual act of writing difficult, only getting started. The same goes for programming: once I had successfully implemented the main functionality I set out to imbue First Crack with, I ceased iterating on the project not for lack of new ideas&#160;&#8212;&#160;with the underlying code functional and working, I wanted to design an accompanying GUI, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;but instead because I lacked the drive to approach such a monumental task. I was burned out, I suppose, tired after working on the same project for months and months, and stuck in a linkblog rut when it came to writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Copying iOS 7 is going to be a big problem for cheap hardware. iOS 7&#8217;s appearance and dynamics require a powerful GPU and advanced, finely tuned, fully hardware-accelerated graphics and animation APIs. This will hurt web imitators most, but it&#8217;s also going to be problematic for Android: while high-end Android phones have mostly caught up in GPU performance, and recent Android versions have improved UI acceleration, most Android devices sold are neither high-end nor up-to-date.&#8221; - Marco Arment in  <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/27/ios7-as-defense"><em>iOS 7 As Defense</em></a>. Craig Hockenberry made the same point in episode forty-six of John Gruber&#8217;s The Talk Show around minute 35:40.</p>

<p>Wonderfully worded and impressively well thought-out, Matt Gemmel&#8217;s article <em>iOS 7</em> is easily the best piece on the topic I have read since the WWDC keynote address. In explaining the motivation behind Apple&#8217;s complete UI overhaul in iOS7, he began his one-two punch with this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The thing is, we&#8217;ve grown up. We don&#8217;t require hand-holding to tell us what to click or tap. Interactivity is a matter of invitation, and physical cues are only one specific type. iOS 7 is an iOS for a more mature consumer, who understands that digital surfaces are interactive, and who doesn&#8217;t want anything getting in the way of their content.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, following up, he said something <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/anti-ios-7-anger.html">curiously familiar</a> before moving on with the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The basic functionality hasn&#8217;t changed. You still use iOS in the same way, and almost everything is where you expect it to be. The same gestures work. There are a few differences here and there - it&#8217;s a major new version of the OS, after all - but the changes are mostly aesthetic. You won&#8217;t be confused by iOS 7 if you&#8217;re accustomed to a previous version.&#8221;</p>

<p>I try to, for the most part, stay positive when I write on here. Instead of taking a page out of Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s play book, not that there is anything wrong with his approach, and calling shenanigans and bullshit when I see shenanigans and bullshit, I try to &#8220;take the high road&#8221; and either ignore bad writing and poorly-formed opinions altogether, or criticize them generously. In the wake of the iOS 7 announcement though, many people have said things that I consider&#160;&#8212;&#160;quite frankly&#160;&#8212;&#160;stupid, especially concerning iOS 7&#8217;s overhauled interface.</p>

<p>Although I make it a point not to spend much time talking about my personal life on this blog, it occasionally creeps in to my writing in the form of an anecdote, perhaps, or the inspiration for an entire article. A few weeks before Christmas last year, I linked to an article by Jason Snell titled <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2018600/why-im-writing-on-the-ipad.html"><em>Why I&#8217;m Writing on the iPad</em></a>, in which he talked about a time when he was forced to write using a pen and paper rather than on a computer. In <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-on-the-ipad.html">my brief article linking to that piece</a>, I talked about a six month period during which I kept a journal for a person very near and dear to my heart. I happened across that article a few minutes ago in the process of writing a new piece, and this paragraph struck a chord:</p>

<p>&#8220;With each paragraph you write, double the amount of time you spend editing. It&#8217;s not just grammar and spelling errors that might be hurting your credibility. Is your point clear, literate, and concise? Have you pruned aggressively to find the core of what you&#8217;re saying? With each additional paragraph, the higher the chance becomes that you&#8217;ve made an egregious mistake that might make your email confusing and forgettable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one wants to think of themselves as a Luddite, which is part of what makes technological conservatism so insidious. It can color the thinking of the nerdiest among us, even as we use the latest hardware and software and keep up with all the important tech news. The certainty of our own tech savvy can blind us to future possibilities and lead us to reject anything that deviates from the status quo. We are not immune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps not necessarily a representative sample of this great article by John Siracusa, I nevertheless chose this quotation from the piece reminiscent of the Hypercritical episodes of days since passed because, like John&#8217;s epic rants of old, it was just too good to let pass without note or comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the one hand, I worry that Pixar is making too many sequels. On the other, I&#8217;d love to see another Incredibles movie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone, somewhere, once said something to the effect of the higher the number the less-good the sequel. Certainly there are some exceptions to that rule&#160;&#8212;&#160;Toy Story, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;but by and large it has proved a valid hypothesis. Take Cars 2: as much as I wanted to love that movie after the first, I couldn&#8217;t do it. An endless number of examples and counter-examples could be made on both sides of this argument, but I, for one, look forward to anything with Pixar&#8217;s name on it, regardless of whether or not a digit follows it.</p>

<p>Since John Gruber abruptly announced that The Talk Show would move from 5by5 to the Mule Radio Syndicate a few months ago, many have speculated as to the reasons behind this sudden and unexpected split while both John and Dan remained, for the most part, silent. Twitter exploded with questions, theories, and, in some cases, anger; bloggers wrote long articles filled with speculation; Philip Elmer-DeWitt, writing for CNN Money, even entered the conversation with an uncharacteristically unemotional <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/19/john-gruber-jumps-ship/">article</a> for the topic; however, to this day John and Dan are the only two who know the actual cause for the split. Here I will aggregate the most common discussions and the strongest theories in an attempt at discerning the underlying cause for this unfortunate rift, using this topic as a manner through which to discuss the Mule Radio Syndicate of which I have many opinions on. I originally intended to incorporate this discussion into my post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/5by5.html"><em>5by5</em></a>, but following the announcement that both Hypercritical and Build &#38; Analyze would close their doors before the year&#8217;s end I chose to pause, step back, thank Dan, Marco, and John for the excellent work, and give a brief history of 5by5 and its impact on the podcasting industry. Separating these two articles also gave me the opportunity to fully explore all the possibilities of this unfortunate happenstance.</p>

<p>Emin Gun writing on Hacking Distributed about the impending demise of Google Reader and the farcical backlash that ensued following the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Second, I suspect that the Reader-loving hacker-turned-entrepreneur crowd, which is deeply insecure about its position in society, is perhaps so sensitive because they see this as a sign that Google, and by proxy, the computer industry, values the masses with their dirty mobile devices and effervescent Twitter feeds more than the self-titled &#8216;digital cognescenti&#8217; with their MacBooks and Reader accounts and IFTTT recipes that save noteworthy articles in Evernote or whatever. They want to flex their digital muscle. And to some extent, I sympathize with this. But let&#8217;s call a spade a spade, and let&#8217;s pick something more worthy over which to flex our muscle. My greatest fear is what would happen if Google were to go back on their decision. It will feed the crazed, self-important &#8216;technocrati&#8217; so much that we&#8217;ll be deluged with overblown outrage at every perceived online slight. I know how 2 year olds turn out when they get their way with tamper tantrums.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emin made a lot of great points in his article, my favorite of which was his call for all the people whining and complaining about Google&#8217;s announcement to instead focus their collective energies into making or finding a good alternative to Reader. If you can code, write a script to fetch and parse your favorite feeds; such a challenge would be simple and take a few evenings, at best; if not, there are plenty of alternatives out there. Embrace this change, don&#8217;t fight it.</p>

<p>My problem, if it could even be called that, with my obviously beloved Cabin Porn tumblr is not really a problem as much as a twinge of disappointment I felt as I made my way through all fifty-six pages on the site. I was disappointed because as I neared and eventually surpassed the halfway point, fewer of the cabins were actually that: a cabin; rather, many of the structures featured on Cabin Porn were more akin to small houses than the cozy, generally handcrafted buildings nestled away from civilization I came to the site looking for. It got progressively worse as I approached the final page. Now granted, in recent years the folks at Beaver Brook have gotten much better at this, but it nevertheless left me feeling slightly dissatisfied when I closed page #56.</p>

<p>John Coffer, in an excellent video produced by <a href="http://www.lostfoundfilms.com/">Lost &#38; Found Films</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I was living in Florida and I had a nice two-bedroom condominium, a garage, a swimming pool, some tangerine trees outside, a sports car and a Ford van. It wasn&#8217;t really very fulfilling, in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My cabin at Beaver Brook is in a forest that used to be mostly dominated by white pines, the tallest trees in the Eastern United States. The forest was nearly clear cut and the logs were floated down the nearby Delaware River to Philadelphia where they were used as structural beams for buildings and British ships. ... Now, BB&#8217;s trees are mostly 40-50 years old, though I&#8217;m grateful there are still a few old growth trees to remind me of the previous magnificence of this historic forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>What struck me about this post as I scrolled through <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/">Cabin Porn</a> earlier this morning was not the sad story, but the cover of Erik Rutkow&#8217;s book: featuring two cowboys, for lack of a better term, amidst a huge forest of leviathan trees. It saddens me to think that today, we lack both.</p>

</h2>
<time id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-24 14:32:54-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/24 14:32:54 EST</time>
<p>After writing my last post, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-next-step.html"><em>The Next Step</em></a>, and as I went back to perusing the steady stream of news and articles I proctor throughout the day, I started thinking about the prevalence of the Apple blog. I touched on this briefly in my last article. There&#8217;s a strangely pervasive mentality in the blogosphere these days that in order to be successful, one must do some combination of three things: write about Apple, adopt the linkblog format, and post regularly, the argument being that few companies are as interesting to write about as Apple. For the most part, I agree with these requirements: nobody writes about Microsoft anymore, because Microsoft isn&#8217;t doing anything revolutionary anymore; for the same reason, nobody writes about Samsung or Oracle or Adobe. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple is the only interesting company on the market. As I said in my previous post, Google is doing many of the same things Apple does and receives so much attention for, although granted often to a lesser degree. In fact, Google does even more with their much broader research and development division, leading to the creation of driverless vehicles, augmented reality glasses, and, most recently, an experimental cell network. No other company in the world can claim the same.</p>

<p>An article from Ben Brooks posted in November of last year I had near the middle of my Simplenote list, burried beneath a slew of notes, ideas, and half-baked articles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested in writing when it&#8217;s not about the writing. iBooks Author is neat, but I don&#8217;t want to learn it - instead I&#8217;ll just &#8220;publish&#8221; the book here as a series of posts, where I know what I am doing (somewhat) and where writing is about writing and not layout, marketing, legal issues, notices, copyrights, glossaries, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with his conclusion, as I&#8217;m sure many writers do. That&#8217;s why, in part, I built First Crack: so that once it was working, I didn&#8217;t need to worry about the logistics and nitpicky details of publication. Instead, I could write in an environment in which &#8220;writing is about writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few years ago, when I lived in Minnesota, my friend and I split our time between two activities: building robots and building rockets. We built our robots of Legos and our rockets of cardboard and balsa wood. When we weren&#8217;t occupied with one of those endeavors we spent our evenings racing his go-cart around the empty parking lot across from his house, our afternoons building zip lines in his backyard instead of doing the work we were supposed to, and our mornings being homeschooled by our moms. Outside of that relatively small allocation to formalized learning, we were allowed to pursue whatever interested us.</p>
