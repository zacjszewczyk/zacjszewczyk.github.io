</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-12-11 08:02:29-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-12.html">12</a>/11 08:02:29 EST</time>
<p>Jason Fenske does a nice job explaining why the Cybertruck will not tow well: high efficiency gives electric vehicles competitive ranges despite their batteries&#8217; low energy capacity, but also means that even a light, 5,000 pound trailer will slash that figure. In <code>distance = energy / force</code>, a small numerator (low capacity) causes range to drop off much faster as the denominator (towed weight) increases. See the blue graph below, which depicts range (the y-axis) as a function of towed weight (the x-axis). Traditional vehicles, although less efficient, have vast energy stores; in their case, a high numerator means the denominator has much less of an impact as it increases. See this in the green graph.</p>

<p>As I said about the Cybertruck <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tesla-cybertruck.html">last week</a>, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a very good sportscar, and it&#8217;s not a very good truck.&#8221; I <a href="/blog/expedition-rigs.html#Electric">still think electric vehicles will revolutionize the overland space</a>, but it will take years for the batteries to get there.</p>

<p>Update on February 18, 2020: Jalopnik posted a quick writeup on an Audi E-Tron&#8217;s range with and without a large trailer. The trailer cut range in half. See the post here: <a href="https://jalopnik.com/an-audi-e-tron-towed-a-gm-ev1-from-tulsa-to-austin-ran-1841707034"><em>An Audi E-Tron Towed A GM EV1 From Tulsa To Austin, Range Was Affected</em></a></p>

<p>I often <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-mornings-reads.html">see articles</a> that I would like to talk about, but that I do not feel warrant a whole post here. Twitter is the obvious choice for quips like these, but I have little love for the service, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">prefer</a> to keep all my work <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-own-your-platform.html">on my own platform</a>, and feel that nuanced opinions should not come in 280 character bursts. Occasional &#8220;lightning rounds&#8221; will fill that gap. Together, a handful of these micro posts will make a full one, giving me somewhere to share things that used to just slip through the cracks.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://qz.com/1759474/only-9-percent-of-15-year-olds-can-distinguish-between-fact-and-opinion/">Only 9% of 15-year-olds can tell the difference between fact and opinion</a>. Does the responsibility for differentiating between fact and opinion fall on the reader, or the one presenting the information? In the era of fake news, amidst a resurgence of propaganda, you may feel tempted to say it falls on the reader. Consider this, though: if I present false information as fact to you here, you cannot know it&#8217;s falsehood <em>without doing your own, independent research</em>. The responsibility for differentiating between fact and opinion, then, falls on the presenter&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the reader, who has no way of knowing truth from fiction by default, has a responsibility to <em>verify</em> the presenter&#8217;s claims. This is a nuanced distinction, but an important one.</li>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3523237-zuckerberg-doubles-down-on-ad-policy">Zuckerberg doubles down on ad policy</a>. From Seeking Alpha, quoting Mark Zuckerberg: &#8220;&#8216;What I believe is that in a democracy, it&#8217;s really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying, so they can make their own judgments,&#8217; he said. &#8216;And, you know, I don&#8217;t think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news.&#8217;&#8221; Facebook commands an unprecedented majority of the world&#8217;s time and attention. As a result, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-internet-and-the-third-estate.html">it may very well lead to the Second Estate&#8217;s overthrow</a>. The idea that it should <em>also</em> become the arbiter of truth boggles my mind. See above. </li>
<li><a href="https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.6">En-ROADS Interactive Climate Simulator</a>. I would have more interest in a simulator that modeled temperature change based on the behavior of individual countries. See related: <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/us-emissions-have-no-effect-on-temperatures.html">U.S. Emissions Have Almost No Effect on Global Temperatures</a>.</li>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-12-04 08:19:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-12.html">12</a>/04 08:19:51 EST</time>
<p>A few days late, again, but here it is: First Crack&#8217;s release notes for November, 2019. Again in October, like <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0919.html">in September</a>, I spent most of my dev time on an Instapaper-like read later service. I use it every day, and plan to release it. I did get a couple things done, though; once again, I did not neglect <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> entirely.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="NovemberActivity">November Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#NovemberActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>CSS grid replaced old-fashioned tables to make the navigation menu, <a href="/archives.html">archives page</a>, and <a href="/blog/2019.html">year breakdowns</a> more responsive. I had been using media queries to make the site responsive before, but CSS grid does it better, more consistently, and with less code. About time I caught up to the rest of the industry.</p>

<br />

<p>I also spent some more time on&#160;&#8212;&#160;shocker&#160;&#8212;&#160;performance. Some legacy code cruft was adding a minuscule amount of unnecessary overhead to First Crack. For an engine that generates over a thousand pages in less than a second, though, that overhead meant the difference between execution time looking like <code>0.85 &lt; runtime &lt; 1.2</code> and <code>0.83 &lt; runtime &lt; 0.90</code>. I then gave up my hard-won performance gains to avoid a race condition.</p>

<p>During initialization, First Crack used to create <em>one</em> Markdown parser for <em>all</em> the files. This worked fine, because the parser&#8217;s buffers got cleared for each new file. I started having problems <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0819.html">in August</a>. With the engine now running on multiple cores but still using that one parser, each core kept overwriting the buffers with data from a different file. Although a clear flaw, the vast majority of my articles consist of paragraphs, so this had almost no impact: if core #1 processed three paragraphs and then core #7 jumped in with a paragraph before core #1 read its fourth paragraph, both cores still built an HTML file with four and one paragraphs, respectively. This became a problem, though, when core #1 processed three lines of a table, and then core #7 jumped in with a paragraph. The parser then made two wrong decisions: first, because the previous lines were table rows and it now had a plain paragraph, core #7 would receive a close table tag plus the new line formatted as a paragraph; then, when core #1 sent the fourth row of its table, the parser saw this as a <em>new</em> table and sent back an open table tag plus the new line formatted as a table row. At the end of this convoluted process, core #7 had a file with an unnecessary <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code>, and core #1 had a file with at least two nested tables.</p>

<p>But wait, it gets better.</p>

<p>If core #1 managed to get through all four lines of that table before core #7 sent its paragraph, everything worked&#160;&#8212;&#160;but if core #3 entered an unordered list partway through, and core #8 entered a blockquote, while cores #2, #4, #5, and #6 kept sending the parser paragraphs... Yikes. Across eight cores and over a thousand files, First Crack got different lines wrong in different ways, every time I ran it&#160;&#8212;&#160;but it still got most of them right. </p>

<p>I solved this problem by creating an instance of the Markdown parser for each file. This overkill band-aid put execution time back in the <code>0.85 &lt; runtime &lt; 1.2</code> neighborhood. I hope to win back some of that performance by creating one instance of the Markdown parser per core, but I have not gotten around to that yet.</p>

<br />

<p>Last, First Crack now resizes the command line interface if it detects a window less than 59 characters wide. I chose this number because the longest menu item comes in at 59 characters long, and took the time to do this because I dislike wrapped text. For the most part, it looks like garbage in a terminal&#160;&#8212;&#160;but not so with First Crack anymore. For small windows, First Crack gracefully resizes the menu to 45 characters. Any smaller than that, and the text will wrap as usual.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="FeatureRoadmap">Feature Roadmap<span>&nbsp;<a href="#FeatureRoadmap">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I plan to focus on these (mostly minor) features.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReduceMultiprocessingOverhead">Reduce Multiprocessing Overhead<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReduceMultiprocessingOverhead">#</a></span></h3>

<p>As I said above, First Crack now creates a new instance of the Markdown parser for each file. This avoids the race condition, but since the engine farms out posts by year to the individual cores, it only needs to create one instance of the parser per core. Then, as each core finishes processing a file and opens a new one, First Crack can clear that core&#8217;s parser&#8217;s buffers before moving on to the next file. This will minimize unnecessary overhead while still generating correct output files.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would still like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser. Low priority, but something I want to get done nonetheless.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to release my Markdown parser as its own project. I still have some bugs to work out, though, I want to go public with greater coverage of the spec, and I would like to add the ability to parse multi-line strings and entire files at once.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to outline the peculiarities of my implementation of the Markdown spec. This would cover weird edge cases for the most part, but documenting these shortfalls would still have value so that those who use my engine will have some sort of explanation for why their article looks weird, and so that I may one day fix them. I made some progress here this month, but not enough for a finished product.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImproveDocumentation">Improve Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImproveDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did some work on the documentation this month, but as always, I could do more. Again, a few of the ways I think I can improve the README in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, I want to highlight this.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build.</li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I look forward to the work ahead.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-12-02 11:31:43-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-12.html">12</a>/02 11:31:43 EST</time>
<p>I like to think about things. To riff off <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/start-before-you-think-youre-ready.html">Austin Kleon</a>, I want to become a professional writer so that I can be a professional thinker. For now, though, as I have said <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/life-is-a-hallway.html">many</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">times</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">before</a>, I write to clarify, condense, and record my thoughts. I have sat down today to talk about Tesla&#8217;s new Cybertruck&#160;&#8212;&#160;not because the Internet needs <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hot-takes-on-teslas-cybertruck.html">one more hot take</a>, but rather to pursue those goals.</p>

<p>I will spend little time on the boring stuff. Every website, blog, and Social Median&trade; has covered those subjects well enough by now. In brief, then: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>On the design</strong>: Art is subjective, but design is objective. From the former, subjective standpoint, I see the Cybertruck as a step in <a href="https://gearpatrol.com/2019/11/23/can-truly-beautiful-car-designs-even-exist-anymore/">a good direction</a>; from the latter, objective point of view, I feel less certain. The Cybertruck&#8217;s rigid shell and harsh angles seem to make it a crash test and pedestrian nightmare. Some middle ground must exist between the traditional aluminum and fiberglass body panels I can deform by hand, and the ultra-durable plate steel common in military vehicles, though; perhaps Tesla struck that balance. The unibody platform <a href="https://jalopnik.com/mid-size-trucks-dont-need-frames-1785674405">makes sense</a>, and <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/tesla-cybertruck">by</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-impressions-ride/">all</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk">accounts</a>, the spacious interior will even appease the large market segment who prefer luxe finishes in their utility vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>On the specs</strong>: The Cybertruck specs are good for an electric vehicle, but mediocre for a truck&#160;&#8212;&#160;and bad at $70,000. Do not judge this polygon&#160;&#8212;&#160;with a 14,000 pound towing capacity, 3,500 pound payload, and 500 mile range&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://jalopnik.com/heres-how-tesla-played-itself-with-the-cybertruck-vs-f-1840064923">against an entry-level, $30,000 F-150</a>. Instead, look at the top-of-the-line, $70,000 Cybertruck versus a not-quite-top-of-the-line, $60,000 F-450. For that price, I could get a monstrous truck with a 500 mile range, that could tow over 30,000 pounds&#160;&#8212;&#160;and carry almost 8,000 pounds in its 8 foot bed&#160;&#8212;&#160;with ease. Speaking of beds, Tesla claim of 6.5 feet also bothers me:</li>
</ul>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/Cybertruck_empty.jpg' alt='Tesla Cybertruck True Bed Dimensions' title='Tesla Cybertruck True Bed Dimensions' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Given that Tesla appears to have built the Cyberquad from a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/31175/it-looks-like-the-tesla-cyberquad-atv-is-actually-a-yamaha-raptor-underneath">Yamaha Raptor</a>, which comes in at 72.6" long, I bet the <em>usable</em> bed space comes in closer to six feet&#160;&#8212;&#160;not six and a half. The Cyberquad just fits:</p>

<div class='image'><img src='https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/08_Desktop.jpg' alt='Tesla Cybertruck with Cyberquad' title='Tesla Cybertruck with Cyberquad' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>The Cybertruck looks cool, but has little going for it beyond that. It&#8217;s a truck with near-sportscar-level performance, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk">but it&#8217;s not a very good sportscar</a>, and it&#8217;s not a very good truck. As a vehicle, then, it just doesn&#8217;t interest me, for these reasons and those cited above; as a toe in the waters of a sea change, though, the garishly named Cybertruck does give me hope for a more angular future.</p>

<p>I despise <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8762373/car-design-curves">curvy cars</a>. I just want a box on wheels, like a classic Toyota Land Cruiser or Land Rover Defender. Aside from a Jepp Wrangler, I got as close to that as I could with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/choosing-an-adventure-rig.html">my Toyota 4Runner</a>. I also have no love for the fragility of modern cars. I understand the reasons for large crumple zones and lightweight materials, but delicate trim pieces degrade over time&#160;&#8212;&#160;often quickly, and seldom well. Perhaps the Cybertruck&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/24/20980141/tesla-cybertruck-preorder-deposit-elon-musk">apparent</a> popularity will encourage an automaker to try something new. Besides looking good and making me happy, a Cybertruck-like design would also <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing">slash production costs</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;a <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/08176b5a-ca96-4b82-bd15-336295ec7d14">win, win, win</a>. Tesla did something good with the Cybertruck, but it did not do it well. The fact that anyone did it at all, though, does give me hope.</p>

<p>I like this post a lot, and the idea even more: Noah Gibbs lays out some good reasons to encourage a culture of blogging within an organization, and solid strategies for getting started. My boss floated an idea like this a few weeks ago, and while I had my doubts at first, time&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this piece&#160;&#8212;&#160;have changed my mind. More to follow.</p>

<p>I spent the morning reading hot takes on Tesla&#8217;s new Cybertruck. I have some more thinking to do, but <a href="https://jalopnik.com/a-deep-look-at-the-design-of-tesla-s-cybertruck-1839993654">Jason Torchinsky</a> wrote a great post on the truck&#8217;s design, and <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing">Kim Reynolds</a> did a nice job approaching the topic from a manufacturing standpoint. <a href="https://jalopnik.com/how-the-tesla-cybertruck-hypothetically-measures-up-to-1839993925">Andrew Collins</a> also has a nice comparison of the Cybertruck versus some of its competitors, which is beats on all fronts.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-11-21 07:47:36-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-11.html">11</a>/21 07:47:36 EST</time>
<p>I have a few things to say here, so let me say them all up front. Your diet doesn&#8217;t matter. Your training plan doesn&#8217;t matter. The reason you will never reach your goal is because you don&#8217;t want to. You don&#8217;t work hard enough to achieve it, and nowhere near hard enough for anything like a diet or training plan to make a difference. Those factors come into play at such a high level, one so far from where you are now, that all the time and effort you pour into these areas is wasted. Now let me explain.  </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start by telling you something about myself. I don&#8217;t enjoy running, so I am not good at it; and because I am not good at it, I get injured easily. So when I read about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/upshot/nike-vaporfly-shoe-strava.html">a Nike shoe</a> that makes its wearer three to four percent faster, I almost bought it. I had found the shortcut to conquering the one thing I could not do. I said no, though, and here&#8217;s why: a 4% boost to someone who puts as little effort into this activity as I do would amount to nothing. Running more often would dwarf the minimal gain I might see from those shoes, if I saw any at all. The one step I can take to make the greatest improvement here is towards the track. Getting outside and putting miles behind me will help more than anything else. That is the reality of my situation, and the reason I did not hand Nike $250.  </p>

<p>Regardless of what you hope to achieve in the gym, it&#8217;s not your diet that&#8217;s holding you back; it&#8217;s not an imperfect routine that&#8217;s keeping you from reaching your goal. You will never succeed because you do not work hard enough. You do not put forth enough effort to achieve anything more than mediocrity. Worry about the perfect meal plan once you stop skipping workouts. There are no rest days. Worry about crafting a training plan when you start spending more than an hour working out. There are no time limits. If you want to grow, if you want to make progress, train long, hard, and every day. There is no secret, and there are no shortcuts: go to the gym and lift as heavy as you can, as many times as you can, for as long as you can. Only then will you have any hope of succeeding, and only then will things like diet and volume make a difference; until then, the reason you can&#8217;t lift is because you&#8217;re not trying.</p>

<p>Avdi Grimm wrote an interesting post back in June, about <a href="https://avdi.codes/tools-for-turning-descriptions-into-diagrams/">using text to create simple diagrams</a>. He highlighted a few different tools, but one stood out: <a href="http://www.nomnoml.com/">nomnoml</a>. I used <a href="https://www.umlet.com/">UMLet</a> a lot back in college, to create some mediocre user stories, which soured me on UML in general. I gave nomnoml a shot, though, and created this simple network diagram:</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/example_network.png' alt='Example network diagram created with nomnoml' title='Example network diagram created with nomnoml' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Check out the code that generated it, below:</p>

<p>Most people use PowerPoint for simple network diagrams, and Visio Studio for more complex ones, but I liked using nomnoml more than either of those. Next time I need to mock up something simple, I&#8217;ll go there first.</p>

<p>At home, I can send a link from any device to a local web server that saves it for later. Then, when I have time to read, I can see all my saved articles, move them into folders, and refer back to them as needed. At work, though, those links go into a text file. When I get home, I find the text file, open it, copy the list, clear the file, close it, and then send the list to the server. <code>pbcopy</code> makes that process just a little easier. Now, <code>cat ingest.txt &gt; pbcophy &#38; echo "" &gt; ingest.txt</code> puts the contents of <code>ingest.txt</code> on my clipboard and then clears the file, so I can add the links through the web interface with just a bit less hassle.</p>

<p>The Economist took an interesting look at how citizens view politicians when they lie, and their conclusion warrants concern: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You might expect (or hope) that thoughtful people would be more amenable to the force of fact-based evidence than most. Alas, no. According to David Perkins of Harvard University, the brighter people are, the more deftly they can conjure up post-hoc justifications for arguments that back their own side.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads well into a point Ryan Holiday made back in March, in <a href="https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1"><em>It&#8217;s Not Enough to Be Right&#160;&#8212;&#160;You Also Have to Be Kind</em></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There is this unshakeable assumption that if they can just present the right fact[, ...] that people will change their minds. ... After spending years and millions of words and hours of video on this, we&#8217;ve had almost zero success. Why? Because you can&#8217;t reason people out of positions they didn&#8217;t reason themselves into. No one responds well to having their identity attacked. No argument made in bad faith&#160;&#8212;&#160;that the person on the other side is a moron or a dupe or a racist or a snowflake&#160;&#8212;&#160;is ever going to be received in good faith.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sooner this becomes not just common knowledge, but also common practice, the sooner we can move beyond petty divisions and focus on <a href="https://dchhaddendum.libsyn.com/ep7-hardcore-history-on-fire">steering the empire from total collapse</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick O&#8217;Neill did <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614646/inside-the-microsoft-team-tracking-the-worlds-most-dangerous-hackers/">a nice job</a> explaining why Microsoft, as an organization, does threat intelligence so well. Yes, it has piles of money and legions of smart people to throw at this problem, but Microsoft&#8217;s biggest leg up over everyone else is the massive data flow its ubiquity enables. This means its Threat Intelligence Center sees things no one else does, and has the context to identify malicious activity that&#160;&#8212;&#160;even given the same raw data&#160;&#8212;&#160;no one else would know to flag. Those looking to step into the cybersecurity realm, even if just to beef up their home network, should take note. </p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-11-02 16:05:01-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-11.html">11</a>/02 16:05:01 EST</time>
<p>Again in October, like <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0919.html">in September</a>, I spent most of my dev time on an Instapaper-like read later service. I use it every day, and plan to release it sometime soon. I did get a couple things done, though; once again, I did not neglect <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> entirely.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="OctoberActivity">October Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#OctoberActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>By &#8220;a couple things&#8221;, I do mean two: in October, I fixed a reference error that kept the favicon from showing up on all pages, and added a dark mode that uses the neat <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a> attribute to detect user preference. </p>

<h2 class="headers" id="NovemberPlan">November Plan<span>&nbsp;<a href="#NovemberPlan">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I may focus on these areas in October, 2019. I carried most of these over from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0919.html">last month&#8217;s update</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would still like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser. Low priority, but something I want to get done nonetheless.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to release my Markdown parser as its own project. I still have some bugs to work out, though, I want to go public with greater coverage of the spec, and I would like to add the ability to parse multi-line strings and entire files at once.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to outline the peculiarities of my implementation of the Markdown spec. This would cover weird edge cases for the most part, but documenting these shortfalls would still have value so that those who use my engine will have some sort of explanation for why their article looks weird, and so that I may one day fix them. I made some progress here this month, but not enough for a finished product.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImproveDocumentation">Improve Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImproveDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did some work on the documentation this month, but as always, I could do more. Again, a few of the ways I think I can improve the README in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, I want to highlight this.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build.</li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I look forward to the work ahead.</p>

The implication of overthrowing the Second Estate, via the empowerment of commoners[, the Third Estate], is almost too radical to imagine.”</p>

<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">A fascinating perspective</a>. The First Estate did not lose control without a fight&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a great deal of complaining&#160;&#8212;&#160;and it seems the Second Estate will follow suit.

<p>Since this has become a politics-adjacent post, I have found Mathew Stoller&#8217;s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/">BIG newsletter</a> quite interesting over the last few weeks, too.

<p>Jason and Nikki Wynn wrote a fantastic article that explains how they get Internet access on their sailboat. I spend a lot of time thinking about this, as I prepare to one day build and live in <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">my own RV</a>. I have an article in the works that outlines a few different approaches, as well as my own plan. In brief, though, I plan to use a dedicated LTE modem for my primary connection, with a satellite link as a fallback. This will give me a stronger connection than a cellphone, hotspot, or even the oft-cited WeBoost in most of the Americas. On the off-chance I have no signal but need one, satellite data prices have come down enough to make that a viable way to ensure I always have some sort of connectivity.</p>

<p>The &#8220;pound for pound&#8221; metric does a fine job of comparing two peoples&#8217; relative strength. It accounts for the difference between someone weighing in at 175 who deadlifts 585, and me weighing in at 220 who deadlifts the same. I have a lot of respect for that other guy. This metric does not trump absolute numbers, though. Argue all you want, but the pound for pound &#8220;stronger&#8221; person, who maxes out with weights someone else uses to warm up, is far weaker; that other guy&#8217;s max would break him. You may convince yourself that an arbitrary ratio makes them comparable, but the iron will crush that argument, too.</p>

<p>From Simon Pitt <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-death-of-the-computer-file-doc-43cb028c0506">over at OneZero</a>, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The other day, I came across a website I&#8217;d written over two decades ago. I double-clicked the file, and it opened and ran perfectly. Then I tried to run a website I&#8217;d written 18 months ago and found I couldn&#8217;t run it without firing up a web server, and when I ran NPM install, one or two of those 65,000 files had issues that meant node failed to install them and the website didn&#8217;t run. When I did get it working, it needed a database. And then it relied on some third-party APIs and there was an issue with CORS because I hadn&#8217;t whitelisted localhost. My website made of files carried on, chugging along. <strong>This isn&#8217;t me saying that things were better in the old days. I&#8217;m just saying that years ago websites were made of files; now they are made of dependencies.</strong>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do think things were better in the old days, <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">so I&#8217;ll stick to static files and vanilla Python for my projects</a>.</p>

<p>I have read a lot of Aaron and Jen&#8217;s work, but it took <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2401891/airstream-flying-cloud-tour">this video</a> to make me realize how nice they had it. Their Airstream-Silverado combo makes for a great setup, which made me re-think <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">my plan</a> to build an LMTV-based RV. With $40,000 for a used Airstream, though, plus another $30,000 for a used truck to pull it, I would spend more going this route and get a less capable setup. The M1083 will give me more living space atop a chassis that can go almost anywhere&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a trailer, no matter how slick, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">just can&#8217;t compete with that</a>.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-10-07 08:01:17-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-10.html">10</a>/07 08:01:17 EST</time>
<p>As I rolled into the last week of September, I started thinking about this post and how I have done almost nothing for it. I put a lot of work into some major performance wins <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0819.html">last month</a>, but lost almost all that momentum when I decided to write my own <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>-like read later service in September. It needs some more work before I release it, but I will. I did get a couple things done, though, even if I did forget to post this until the first week of October had already passed; I did not neglect <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> entirely.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="SeptemberActivity">September Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#SeptemberActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Most of my work in September involved refactoring and code documentation&#160;&#8212;&#160;the un-sexy but necessary work that makes for a better project in the long run. Outside of that, I also took some time to enable First Crack to handle articles written in raw HTML. This need came about as I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/building-a-syllable-dictionary-in-python.html">Building a Syllable Dictionary in Python</a>, which made heavy use of long HTML blocks for static code snippets with syntax highlighting. Most websites use Javascript for this, but thanks to <a href="http://hilite.me/">hilite.me</a>, I avoided that. After the title block, use <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> to keep First Crack from parsing the rest of the article as Markdown.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="OctoberPlan">October Plan<span>&nbsp;<a href="#OctoberPlan">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I plan to focus on these areas in October, 2019. I carried most of these over from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0819.html">last month&#8217;s update</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would still like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser. Low priority, but something I want to get done nonetheless.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to release my Markdown parser as its own project. I still have some bugs to work out, though, I want to go public with greater coverage of the spec, and I would like to add the ability to parse multi-line strings and entire files at once.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to outline the peculiarities of my implementation of the Markdown spec. This would cover weird edge cases for the most part, but documenting these shortfalls would still have value so that those who use my engine will have some sort of explanation for why their article looks weird, and so that I may one day fix them. I made some progress here this month, but not enough for a finished product.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImproveDocumentation">Improve Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImproveDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did some work on the documentation this month, but as always, I could do more. Again, a few of the ways I think I can improve the README in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, I want to highlight this.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build.</li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I look forward to the work ahead.</p>

<p>As most projects do, this one started small. I already had a way to preview Markdown files. <a href="/projects.html#proofer">Proofer</a> also counts words, sentences, and paragraphs, then averages those values and estimates reading time. The script finds <a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html">complex or overused phrases</a>, and highlights repeated words, be verbs, and adverbs that make for weak writing, too. It also calculates the Gunning Fog Index, and scores for the Flesch-Kincaid reading ease and grade level tests. I built this script to give me a few more features than <a href="https://marked2app.com/">Marked</a>, which I had used to proof my writing for years. It worked well, but runtime shot up if it had to process posts with more than a few hundred words. I set out to fix this, and ended up building an entire syllable dictionary in Python. Proofer has still not gotten any faster.</p>



<p>Proofer had no trouble with small files, but runtime shot up if it had to process posts with more than a few hundred words. Runtime went up as word count did, and so I started hunting for performance wins in <a href="https://github.com/eaydin/sylco/blob/master/sylco.py">the 129-line method that counted syllables</a>. Called for every word in the source file but not optimized for speed or memory use, this seemed like a good place to start.</p>



<h3>The Original Syllable Counter</h3>



<p>Counting syllables seems easy. Spend some time looking for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9096228/counting-syllables-in-a-word">examples</a> of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46759492/syllable-count-in-python">others</a> doing <a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/programming/count-syllables-in-python.html">this</a>, though, and you will soon realize that the English language makes this quite hard. I did not want to sink a ton of time into this, so I used this script from Emre Aydin.</p>

<p>This seemed like a lot just to count a few syllables. It made poor use of memory, too, by doing things like allocating variables that it then used one time.

<p>Take comments and whitespace out, and Emre's counter comes in at 70 lines long. My version sits at 66 lines but cuts runtime by 9%. It pays to worry about things like efficiency and memory usage after all. As I marveled at my own brilliance, though, I realized that this might not matter. Emre gave this a shot back in 2016 with no guarantee of its accuracy. Cutting runtime by any number meant nothing if the algorithm did not work. Before I spent any more time trimming an unproven script, I needed to test it against a known good source; I needed to test it against a dictionary.</p>



<p>This seemed like an easy task:</p>



<ol>

<li>Read a word from the dictionary</li>

<li>Use the algorithm to count its syllables</li>

<li>Compare the algorithm's count to the dictionary's</li>

</ol>



<p>As long as the algorithm gave me the right syllable count most of the time, I could speed it up, make it more accurate, and then repeat that process as many times as I wanted. I ran into problems starting with step one, though: UNIX has no native dictionary. It does have a wordlist, with over 200,000 words, but I needed a dictionary to give me valid words *and* the number of syllables they contained. Without that number, from an authoritative source, I had nothing to test the algorithm's accuracy.</p>



<p>Because I needed my script to pull words and syllable counts from the dictionary, I needed something with a command line interface. The built-in dictionary app on my Mac, <code>dictionary.app</code>, seemed like an easy answer, but supports only [basic programatic access](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/DictionaryServicesProgGuide/access/access.html). <code>dictd</code> looked like it fit the bill, but I had trouble getting it to install. It "succeeded", but never ran. A third-party dictionary violated my self-reliance principle anyway, so I cleared all the install files and went back to my old standby: web scraping.</p>



<p>My script started out simple. Read words from the UNIX wordlist at <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>, get a syllable breakdown from Google or <a href="https://howmanysyllables.com">HowManySyllables.com</a>, and record the result in a new wordlist. Check out my first try below.</p>

<p>It took almost two days to get through A and B, at just over 25,000 words. I did not have the patience to spend a month working through the other 90% of the dataset, so I made some changes for B to Z.</p>



<p>First, I split up the 235,886 line wordlist by letter. This gave me twenty-six sub-wordlists: <code>a.txt</code>, <code>b.txt</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>It would have taken me another twenty-six days to work through those twenty-six wordlists, so I decided to put my quad core processor to work by enabling multiprocessing. Python's handy <code>multiprocessing</code> module would farm out each dictionary lookup to its own core, which would allow me to use all eight of my logical processors to make quick work of this task. <code>BuildSyllableDictionaryWithMultiprocessing</code> farmed a sub-wordlist out to each processor. <code>BuildDictionary</code> enumerated the sub-wordlist to build the syllable dictionary. <code>DownloadSyllable</code> did the web scraping to capture the syllable count.</p>

<p>How Many Syllables never did block me, so I just commented out the part that checked Google first and drove on. Within a day, I had syllable count for all twenty-six sub-wordlists. <code>FinalCheck</code> made sure each sub-wordlist was not missing any words, <code>CombineWordlists</code> produced a master syllable dictionary I named <code>webS</code>, and <code>CompareWordlists</code> made sure the syllable dictionary had all the words from the original wordlist.</p>

<p>So how did my web scraper do? <code>FindNoSyllables</code>--below--told me that out of 235,886 words in the wordlist, the scraper could not find syllables for 102,461. Not great.</p>

<p>85,524 left. Just by checking for proper nouns alone, I ruled out 16,937 words that, of course, will not be in a dictionary. What about the rest? Many are words with prefixes and suffixes whose roots exist in the dictionary, but that do not exist in their present form. Take "absenteeship", for example. Others are foreign words like "haori", which is a traditional Japanese jacket. "Pharyngotonsillitis" is a medical condition. Are these words? Yes. Am I concerned about testing my syllable counter against them? No. Whether it counts seven syllables in pharyngotonsillitis or not, I will sleep just fine at night.</p>



<br />



<!-- Conclusion -->

<p>As most projects do, this one started small--and then it got out of hand. <a href="/projects.html#proofer">Proofer</a> has not gotten any faster, but now I have a syllable dictionary to test the syllable count method so that I can then write a new method optimized for speed and memory use. Maybe, at the end of all this, Proofer will be a bit faster. That's ... something. Right?</p>

<p>I like these drawers from Land Shark Outfitters. With <a href="https://www.goose-gear.com/collections/toyota-4runner-5th-gen-2010-present">big names in the space</a> pricing their systems at well over $1,000, I love the idea of a polished product at half the price. <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">My sleeping platform</a> came out to about $600, with two sets of $215 <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/6603a55">36&#8220; lock open/close slides</a> and a $145 pair of <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/1102A71">28&#8221; base mount slides</a>. Having gone through that build process, though, and after seeing this system from Land Shark Outfitters, I think I could cut it in half. My 4Runner may have a Jeep parked beside it within the next year or two, so we will find out soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/lets-talk-about-landcruisers.html">I have said it before</a>, and I will say it again: if I had the chance to buy a new Defender 110 in North America, I would have a hard time saying no&#160;&#8212;&#160;even though <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/lets-talk-about-landcruisers.html">I have settled on the LandCruiser 78 as my dream adventure platform</a>.

This all comes at a high price, but the results are staggering. These shops have the expertise to build incredible adventure platforms, yet onerous auto industry regulation limits them to restoration builds. I would love to see them create small batch, purpose-built adventure rigs of their own. As long as those well-intentioned, innovation-stifling laws stick around, though, we can hope for little more than cool remixes of already legendary platforms. Thanks to companies like Heritage Driven, it could be worse&#160;&#8212;&#160;but it could also be a lot better.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time over the last few weeks <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/choosing-an-adventure-rig.html">thinking</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/outfitting-my-4runner-for-adventure.html">about</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/building-my-4runner-sleeping-platform.html">my rig</a>, redesigning the Tacoma <a href="/projects#tacomaCamper">I want to build</a>, and dreaming of adventuring. In one of these recurring dreams, I travel to far-flung places in a decked out LandCruiser 78. You may know it as the Troopy or the J78. I fear this will never become a reality, though, for a few reasons I touch on later. But that feeling did get me thinking. Why did I want a Troopy so bad? What would it take to get one? Would something else serve my needs better? Today, let&#8217;s talk about LandCruisers.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheRealLandCruisers">The Real LandCruisers<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheRealLandCruisers">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Toyota sells a few different versions of the 4Runner. In 2018, that line contained the SR5, the TRD Off-Road, and the Limited, to name three. The company also sells a few different versions of the 70 series LandCruiser. In 2019, that line contained the WorkMate (J76), the GX (J79), and the GXL (J78). &#8220;70 series LandCruiser&#8221; defines a family of vehicles, the J7Xs, just as &#8220;4Runner&#8221; does. The family name <a href="https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/toyota-land-cruiser-70-series-forbidden-land-cruis-281474979887372">dates back to the 1980s</a>, when Toyota gave the world the J40. This chassis would later become the celebrated J70. The North American market got the less capable J60. The J60 became the J80 in the 1990s, the J100 at the turn of the century, and the J200 in 2007. The J100 and J200 still sell in North America today, but neither of these vehicles hold a candle to the J70s available almost everywhere else.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheLandCruisersStrengths">The LandCruiser's Strengths<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheLandCruisersStrengths">#</a></span></h3>

<p>The 70 series LandCruiser has made a name for itself as one of the most reliable, long-lasting, and capable vehicles on the road. Its impressive reputation stems from Toyota&#8217;s unique blend of diesel engine, utilitarian design, overbuilt construction, and practical form factor. Although a few other companies manage to tick a couple of those boxes, none check them all&#160;&#8212;&#160;and again, not even Toyota manages that feat in North America. To understand why this package makes the 70 series such a special platform, consider the value of each piece on its own.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ADieselEngine">A Diesel Engine<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ADieselEngine">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Gas engines produce the most power at high RPMs, while diesels produce the most power at lower RPMs. Because off-road drivers tend to pack heavy and go slow, 70 series LandCruisers&#160;&#8212;&#160;with their powerful V8 diesel motors&#160;&#8212;&#160;excel in this environment. Toyota also updated the platform&#8217;s gearing in 2017, making these vehicles well-suited to highway driving, too. This setup gives consumers the best of both worlds, along with unrivaled reliability, longevity, and simplicity. These fantastic engines make the gas motors offered in other, similar vehicles look anemic and incapable by comparison.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="AUtilitarianDesign">A Utilitarian Design<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AUtilitarianDesign">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Modern vehicles have all but done away with any semblance of simplicity. They have become ever more feature-rich and luxurious, which has forced their owners to take on ever fewer maintenance tasks and repair jobs. The masses delight in this shift; car enthusiasts and overlanders despair. The utilitarian design of 70 series LandCruisers means less can go wrong with them, and on the off chance that something does, their owners can fix the problem themselves. This makes the platform a great workhorse, well suited for hash use in even harsher environments.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="AnOverbuiltConstruction">An Overbuilt Construction<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AnOverbuiltConstruction">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Most vehicles these days also trade durability for lightweight materials, an advantage that they then cancel out with more safety features and small engines with better fuel economy. This has the net negative effect of making them far less durable, a downside from which the 70 series LandCruisers do not suffer. This platform has a reputation as one of the toughest, most reliable vehicles on the road, in the world. Its simple and overbuilt construction played an integral role in earning it that notoriety. A 25-year-old 70 series with over 100,000 miles on it holds up so well that it will sell for around $5,000 less than a brand new 4Runner.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ACapableFormFactor">A Capable Form Factor<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ACapableFormFactor">#</a></span></h4>

<p>LandCruisers also strike a good balance between form a function. Their compact chassis makes them capable off-road, while their utilitarian designs maximizes interior space. Compare this with the more bloated&#160;&#8212;&#160;albeit more luxurious&#160;&#8212;&#160;design of the modern 4Runner, or the 100 or 200 series LandCruisers sold in North America. In contrast, the J78 Troop Carrier has seating for up to eleven in a bay that, with its seating removed, could hold cargo almost seven feet long and five feet wide. North Americans must choose between trucks for utility and SUVs for function; the 70 series turns this false dichotomy on its head.</p>

<p>Taken on their own, any of these traits would make a compelling vehicle. Several car companies base entire lines on just one or two. With the 70 series LandCruisers, Toyota brings them all together into a powerful platform that can get you and your gear anywhere you want to go, take the harshest abuse along the way, and roll through it all without the slightest complaint. This unprecedented blend makes 70 series LandCruisers the most sought-after adventure platform in the world. Lofty claims like these, though, always lead to someone asking, &#8220;Well what about Land Rovers?&#8221; The British company has cultivated a similar reputation, but with one key difference.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="WhatAbouttheLandRoverDefender">What About the Land Rover Defender?<span>&nbsp;<a href="#WhatAbouttheLandRoverDefender">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Defender 110s boast many of the same strengths 70 series LandCruisers do. These vehicles also have powerful diesel engines, feature a design even <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15105229/we-drive-every-generation-of-the-land-rover-defender-news/">more</a> <a href="https://www.adventure-journal.com/2018/05/unintentional-review-land-rover-defender-110/">painfully</a> <a href="https://expeditionportal.com/form-meets-function/">utilitarian</a> than Toyota&#8217;s, and sport a form factor that makes them well-suited to off-road environments. They cannot compete in one crucial area, though: reliability. As storied a reputation as this platform has, it has become just as infamous for poor quality control and fit and finish as well. Die-hard fans love these vehicles, but their argument gets much less convincing when making it against the legendary longevity of a LandCruiser. With all other things equal, it made little sense to go this route. Land Rover also discontinued the Defender in 2016, and its replacement looks like the vehicle&#8217;s classic aesthetic collided with the disgusting modern trend of sanding down every edge until auto designers have a soft and inoffensive blob left to sell.</p>

<p>I love the design of a classic Defender 110. If I had the chance to buy a new one today, I would have a hard time walking away from it. When it came to choosing a dream adventure rig, though, I had to take Land Rover out of the running. Toyota has dominated this space for years, for good reason, and its long-time competitor seems to have all but given up trying. Toyota won. This, then, raises an important question: how could I get one?</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Sohowdowegetone">So how do we get one?<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Sohowdowegetone">#</a></span></h3>

<p>If you live in one of a handful of blessed countries, you can buy a 70 series LandCruiser at a Toyota dealership. If not, your country may allow their import. Canada limits these imports to vehicles fifteen years old or older, and the United States ups that number to 25. Satisfy these rules, though, and many companies will streamline this process for you&#160;&#8212;&#160;for a price. Many people have done this, and <a href="https://liveworkwander.com/">they love their rigs</a>. While I could have gone a similar route, the prospect of buying a twenty-five year old vehicle&#160;&#8212;&#160;with over 100,000 miles on it, without having seen it before, and for even more than the price of something new&#160;&#8212;&#160;made me uncomfortable. What choice did I have, though? I had two: 70 series LandCruisers have remarkable resale value, so it would cost me no matter what; using a third party to get a good one would cost even more. Every time I come back to the idea, I end up debating the benefits of each route over the other until I shelve them again. I did get an idea for an alternative, as I flipped through <a href="https://www.treadmagazine.com/">Tread</a> and <a href="https://outdoorx4.com/">OutdoorX4</a> the other day, but I will leave that for my next article.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-09-20 08:19:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-09.html">09</a>/20 08:19:49 EST</time>
<p>I chose the 4Runner for <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/choosing-an-adventure-rig.html">many reasons</a>, and in part because I could take it off-road without expensive upgrades. I needed it to do more than just take me to cool places, though: I needed it to support me once I got out there, too. Because I had set my sights on the East Coast, I focused on <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/outfitting-my-4runner-for-adventure.html">gear to make that trip safer and more fun</a> first, rather than new tires, bumpers, and recovery tools. As part of that process, I built a storage system and sleeping platform in my trunk. Today I want to talk about its conception, design, and construction.  </p>

<p>Because the 4Runner and the Tacoma use the same frame, the choice comes down to whether you prefer a climate-controlled interior or an exposed bed when building a rig. I chose the former because it would take the least work to go from showroom model to adventure vehicle. I did not have the time or resources to make a Tacoma as livable as a stock 4Runner. I still wanted some of the benefits of a pickup, though, such as plenty of storage space and room to sleep on my vehicle in a pinch. I decided I could achieve those goals with a raised platform. My design had to turn the 4Runner&#8217;s trunk and second row of seats into a flat area the size of a mid-size truck bed, with storage underneath; if I had to take passengers, it had to fold back into the trunk. A setup like this would give me the best of both worlds: the livability of an SUV with the capability of a truck, at much less than the price of building out some sort of camper shell.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="DesignCriteria">Design Criteria<span>&nbsp;<a href="#DesignCriteria">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Once I decided to build some sort of platform, I started spelling out my design criteria. First, it had to turn the trunk and second row of seats into a flat area large enough to sleep on. I still wanted to use the second row of seats, though, so it had to fold back into the trunk, too. It also had to stay as short as possible, to maximize headroom. The space beneath it would house camp gear. I also wanted to use that space for a small camp kitchen, with an area for a <a href="https://orcacoolers.com/collections/75-quart/products/green-75-cooler">large cooler</a> or <a href="https://www.snomasterusa.com/product/classic-series-bdc-65-stainless-steel-acdc-fridgefreezer/">portable refrigerator</a> and a stove.  </p>

<p>Over the next few months, I drew many versions of the platform. First on paper, then in Google SketchUp, until I felt I had something worth building. My final design consisted of two drawers in the trunk, one for storage and one for a cooler and a stove. Both would lock open and closed, in case I parked on uneven ground. Over the second row of seats, two independent folding platforms would allow me to stow the left or right side depending on whether I wanted to use the single or double seat in the second row, or both. I have included a picture of the final design below; I also have a link to the 3D model, and a brief writeup, on <a href="/projects">my Projects page</a>.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/4Runner_sleeping_platform.jpg' alt='Full view of 4Runner sleeping platform' title='Full view of 4Runner sleeping platform' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I will share more pictures of the system later. This design met all my criteria, and so I began gathering materials.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="SourcingMaterials">Sourcing Materials<span>&nbsp;<a href="#SourcingMaterials">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Although I got almost everything at the local hardware store, I want to point out that I ordered <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/6603a55">the locking drawer slides</a> from <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com">McMaster-Carr</a>. I can always count on great service and reasonable prices there, and they stock almost any part I can imagine. McMaster-Carr plays an important role in every project I take on, and I encourage everyone to source their parts and raw materials from them.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheBuildProcess">The Build Process<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheBuildProcess">#</a></span></h3>

<p>After a trip to the hardware store, I started cutting on a Sunday afternoon. I did the entire project over the next five days and after many trips back to the store. I did not spend more than a few hours a day on it, though, so I feel confident that I could have finished it in a weekend.  </p>

<p>I spent a lot of time on the 3D model, so I changed little when I built it. I did have to change a couple of things, though, with the folding platform. The original design showed two square boards on each side with a hinge in the middle, that arch up and then fold back into the trunk. When folding, those middle corners collided with the A-pillar on each side. Cutting a curve into the boards before installing them would have kept a lot of sawdust out of my new car. I also had to add a small gap between the two sections, because the seat backs and their bases have different widths. This allowed me to use one platform or the other, or both, depending on the situation. I updated the model to reflect these changes, and included a picture of the new design below. Other than those simple fixes, though, I changed little.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/4Runner_sleeping_platform_rounded_edges.jpg' alt='4Runner sleeping platform with rounded edges' title='4Runner sleeping platform with rounded edges' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Once I had the platform in my vehicle, I used six turnbuckles to lock it down. The 4Runner has two tie-down points behind the second row of seats, and then one next to each wheel well. These keep it from shifting, and keep it quiet on the road; most important, though, in a rollover accident I will not have a heavy wooden block bouncing around my vehicle. Below I have included several pictures of the finished product, along with comments.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheFinishedProduct">The Finished Product<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheFinishedProduct">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5832.jpg' alt='Rear view closeup with both drawers closed and both platforms stowed' title='Rear view closeup with both drawers closed and both platforms stowed' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Here I have both drawers stowed, and the sleeping platform folded. Setup like this, I can use the second row of seats like normal, store gear in the trunk, and still get to the contents of the drawers if I need to. I valued the ability to return my car to &#8220;normal&#8221;, so I feel good about how this turned out.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5806.jpg' alt='Rear view with right drawer open and platform folded' title='Rear view with right drawer open and platform folded' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Some people like a single drawer across the entire trunk, but as I said earlier, I wanted one for storage and one for a small camp kitchen. I can open the right side while leaving everything else closed, as pictured above. I have both drawers open in the picture below, and just the left side after that.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5807.jpg' alt='Rear view with both drawers open' title='Rear view with both drawers open' loading='lazy' /></div>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5808.jpg' alt='Rear view with left drawer open' title='Rear view with left drawer open' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/outfitting-my-4runner-for-adventure.html">As I have explained before</a>, the left drawer houses a stove that slides out over a removable front panel. The panel flips down on a hinge, as you can see in the picture below, which releases the stove, as you can see in the picture after that. I designed the drawer like this so that I could access the cooler and cook at the same time. Although getting slides strong enough to support that much weight cost a lot of money, I believe the functionality warrants the price. If I had to do this over again, I would try making my own slides by sandwiching <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/aluminum-tubing">aluminum T-slot framing and plastic panel slides</a>. I think this would work almost as well and cost about 90% less. </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5809.jpg' alt='Rear view with left drawer open, and removable front panel down' title='Rear view with left drawer open, and removable front panel down' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Check out the camp kitchen from another angle in the picture below. The wooden dowel hanging down from the end, an attempt at a stowable support, does a mediocre job at best.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5811.jpg' alt='Rear view with left drawer open, removable front panel down, and stove out from front side' title='Rear view with left drawer open, removable front panel down, and stove out from front side' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>With both seats stowed, I can extend the platform and sleep in my car. See the first picture below. When I don&#8217;t have a cooler on the left drawer, I have two small boards that cover the gap and level everything out. Although the incline looks sharp, in the second picture, I have no trouble sleeping there.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5812.jpg' alt='Rear view with both drawers closed and platform extended' title='Rear view with both drawers closed and platform extended' loading='lazy' /></div>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5813.jpg' alt='Side view with platform extended' title='Side view with platform extended' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>If I have to take passengers, I can stow either platform to access the seat below, or both to get at the entire row. I have the left side down in the first picture below, the right platform down in the second, and both stowed in the third.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5821.jpg' alt='Side view with left platform extended' title='Side view with left platform extended' loading='lazy' /></div>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5830.jpg' alt='Side view with right platform extended' title='Side view with right platform extended' loading='lazy' /></div>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5831.jpg' alt='Side view with both platforms stowed' title='Side view with both platforms stowed' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I put a lot of work into designing this system, and took my time during the build. I have yet to run into any problems with it, and I do not foresee encountering any in the future. It gives me lots of storage, a great camp kitchen, and allows me to sleep in my vehicle in a pinch. This system made my 4Runner a viable backcountry adventure platform, and just what I needed for my first big trip.  </p>

<p>Gergely Orosz has some great advice for professional networking, for people who don&#8217;t do networking well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A surprisingly efficient networking method I found was doing cold reach-outs to more experienced software engineers, offering to buy them coffee or lunch. In exchange, I asked them to share their advice ... What I did not expect was this approach to be far more valuable than just a one-off networking session. In all cases, I had fascinating conversations on problems they were facing and found myself explaining the biggest challenges on my plate. ... developers buying coffee and having a chat with other, local developers is an underrate hack for professional growth. It is also under-used.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today I get to spend some more time on one of my favorite topics, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">the vehicles you use to get the gear you pack to the places you want to go</a>. I outlined the process that led to my 4Runner in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/choosing-an-adventure-rig.html"><em>Choosing an Adventure Rig</em></a>, and today I want to talk about its loadout. In the first part of this article, I will talk about the gear that stays in my vehicle full-time; in the second, I will outline a basic packing list for a typical adventure.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheEverydayLoadout">The Everyday Loadout<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheEverydayLoadout">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Starting up front, I have three <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075KJ57Q1/">dual USB adapters</a> plugged into the center console. One keeps the driver&#8217;s and the passenger&#8217;s phones charged, while I use the others for two massive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07793KSV4/">RAVPower 26800mAh portable battery packs</a>. Dual QuickCharge 3.0 ports take charge time down from sixteen hours with a single input, to around eight with two. I wanted to minimize that time so that I could get the most out of the occasional resupply run into town, and avoid running my engine for electricity while on the trail. I like to have a small solar panel on-hand to help with this as well. I used a now-discontinued Anker model on short weekend camping trips, in the Canadian backwoods, and on the Mongolian Steppe with zero issues; today RAVPower sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-RAVPower-Waterproof-Foldable-Compatible/dp/B06XBGSS2R/">a similar, more powerful model</a> that I stash behind the driver&#8217;s seat.  </p>

<p>I also keep a small survival kit in the center console. Although I never plan to live out of that small tin, having a backup knife, fire starter, and a few other odds and ends have served me well. I never use anything in this kit, so I always have it to fall back on if I break or lose something on the trail.  </p>

<p>In both the driver&#8217;s and the passenger&#8217;s doors, I keep the same set of equipment: a set of road flares, a trauma first-aid kit, a Leatherman multi-tool, a flashlight, and a regular pocket knife. This leaves enough room for snacks or other small items while on the road, but ensures that both the driver and passenger have quick access to some important tools in an emergency. Neither has to run around the car to the other door for a flashlight, then back to their side for a first-aid kit, for example. If something goes wrong, the focus becomes dealing with the emergency&#160;&#8212;&#160;not locating the means to do so. The one exception to this rule is a fire extinguisher, which stays in the glove compartment, but is accessible from both seats.  </p>

<p>Because I never take passengers, I keep the second row of seats stowed, and use the space on top of them for bags and a pair of empty <a href="http://www.sterilite.com/SelectProduct.html?id=989&ProductCategory=312&section=1">totes</a>. I also hang a much more comprehensive first-aid kit off the driver&#8217;s headrest, the contents of which I will talk about soon. Beneath the passenger seat, I stow a portable jump pack, in case I need to jump my car in a remote location. The most interesting aspect of this loadout is the trunk, which houses <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">a custom drawer system and sleeping platform</a>. I plan to dedicate an entire article to it soon, but I will spend some time talking about it now as well.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5805.jpg' alt='4Runner drawer system and sleeping platform, compressed' title='4Runner drawer system and sleeping platform, compressed' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I use the large drawer on the right for storage. I keep my tent, camp chairs, hammock, and a few blankets in there with room to spare. The left drawer houses a stove that slides out over the removable front panel. I also made this side shorter, to accommodate a <a href="https://orcacoolers.com/collections/75-quart/products/green-75-cooler">large cooler</a> or <a href="https://www.snomasterusa.com/product/classic-series-bdc-65-stainless-steel-acdc-fridgefreezer/">portable refrigerator</a>. Although cramped, I can get into the cooler from inside the vehicle, or use the locking slides to access it from outside. On a normal day, the inset does a great job of keeping a small backup backpack stationary, which holds a spare set of PTs, an extra uniform, gym clothes, and a small hygiene kit. Again, I plan to talk about the platform&#8217;s design and build process soon, with many more pictures, a 3D model, and a build list to share.  </p>

<p>On either side of the platform, next to the wheel wells, I stow a few miscellaneous items. A gallon of water, which I use much more often than I would have expected before adding it. A small tool pouch with tools for basic repairs on the road. A pouch of straps and bungee cords for securing loads. Jumper cables. Nothing groundbreaking, just a few things that make my life a little bit easier.  </p>

<p>I keep these items in my vehicle for two reasons. First, because I may need them in an emergency. At one end of the spectrum, if my car refuses to start, I can either jump it or fix minor mechanical malfunctions. Failing that, I can handle getting stranded&#160;&#8212;&#160;even in terrible conditions&#160;&#8212;&#160;for a few days. At the other end of the spectrum, if I come upon a serious accident, I have the tools to help secure the area or treat life-threatening injuries until a medical professional takes over. I also keep this equipment in my vehicle because it cuts down on the gear I have to pack in preparation for a trip. This makes the decision to go just a little bit easier, which increases the likelihood that I will.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AnAdventureLoadout">An Adventure Loadout<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AnAdventureLoadout">#</a></span></h3>

<p>When packing for an adventure, little changes up front: I stow the RAVPower battery packs in the center console, along with <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/572639">a small hand-held GPS unit</a>. I use the Foretrex as a backup for old-fashioned land navigation during field training exercises with the Army. When I go adventuring into unfamiliar territory on my own time, it makes sure I can always find my way back to camp.  </p>

<p>Atop the second row of seats, I put two totes side by side: one contains the entire camp kitchen, and the other holds dry goods. The kitchen box consists of a one-pound propane tank for the stove in the trunk, the fantastic MSR <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAHCMRG/">skillet</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSX8LB7">pots</a> along with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-Skillet-Stovetop/dp/B00006JSUA/">Lodge cast iron skillet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GSI-Outdoors-Pioneer-Enamelware-person/dp/B001LF3IJS/">enamel dinnerware</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SE-KC7043FSK-Survivor-Stainless-Utensil/dp/B0045MBFVW/">cutlery</a>, two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045U2QNA/">dishpan basins</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Chopping-Cutting-Boards-Finfordela/dp/B06XPSLWK2/">cutting board</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0776SHVX4/">knife roll</a> that protects the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JZFLTR4/">Victorinox</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046ZBOKA">knives</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RLJTLS/">inside</a>, the <a href="https://www.wolfandgrizzly.com/products/wg-grill?variant=8385883865143">Wolf &#38; Grizzly M1 Portable Grill</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jetboil-Flash-Cooking-System-Updated-x/dp/B0753NBMJ5/">Jetboil Flash</a>, a single fuel canister, and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jetboil-COF075-Coffee-Press-Accessory/dp/B000NM8O8U">Jetboil coffee press</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GSI-Outdoors-Crossover-Superior-Backcountry/dp/B004LF3JT4">small cooking set</a>, dish soap, hand towels, an oven mitt, and a canister of Clorox wipes. It takes some work, but everything fits into a single container. I slide an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038Q0N96">ALPS Mountaineering Dining Table</a> between the totes and the front seats, which fits just well enough to keep everything from moving around too much.  </p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/MTV/IMG_5812.jpg' alt='4Runner drawer system and sleeping platform, extended over the second row of seats' title='4Runner drawer system and sleeping platform, extended over the second row of seats' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>The sleeping platform, which lays on top of those totes as shown in the picture above, then serves as the base for any personal bags taken on the trip. If I cannot make camp for some reason, I can move those bags into the front seats and sleep inside the vehicle. I have done this a few times, and although not spacious, I slept well.  </p>

<p>I like to plan for the worst-case scenario, so everything I need to make camp in poor conditions stays in the storage drawer in the trunk. I can park, slide it open, and have easy access to my tent, a rain fly, rain gear, and bug spray right away. I store chairs, a hammock, and other small items in here as well, but toward the back to keep more important gear front and center. In a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-17-Gal-Tough-Storage-Tote-in-Black-SH17GTOUGHTLDBY/205808350">tote</a> on top, I store an air mattress, its pump, several blankets, pillows, and a sleeping bag, strapped down to keep it from sliding around. Depending on how long I plan to travel, I will strap down one or two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B001QC31G6">Reliance Products 7 gallon Aqua-Tainers</a>. If I elect to sleep inside the vehicle, the weatherproof tote can either go up front or outside, and the water jugs can go behind the cooler or outside as well. The cooler sits atop its own drawer, for easy access in camp.  </p>

<p>Because I keep emergency gear in my vehicle at all times, and compartmentalize everything else into two totes and a cooler, it does not take long to go from zero to adventure-ready. Toss some clothes in a backpack, carry everything out of the closet, stop by the grocery store on my way out of town, and I can disappear for a weekend with minimal time spent preparing for the trip. This sleek setup makes traveling easier, much less stressful, and far less complicated than it would be with meager organization. As a result, I adventure more, and have more fun doing it.  </p>

<p>Out of all the topics I want to tackle here, I feel most excited to talk about adventuring. Although my passion for it all but died out in high school, after seven moves in as many years, it reignited in college: when I had to decide whether my profession would be the anchor that kept me stationary or the means to a nomadic lifestyle down the road, I chose the latter. This choice has informed every major decision I have made since then, and will continue to influence my actions in the future. Today I want to talk about the first choice it touched, my decision to buy a new car, and the journey that led me to a 2018 Toyota 4Runner.</p>

<p>As my last year of college rolled around, I had some decisions to make. Having driven the family Subaru Forster since high school, the most expensive decision I faced dealt with its replacement. Although reliable, efficient, and capable<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, it had come time for me to buy my own car, and I wanted something different. In particular, I wanted a larger vehicle capable of supporting multi-day backcountry trips, and something better suited to off-road driving. The Forester had impressed me, but could not handle the long-term adventures in austere environments that I had planned.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheCandidates">The Candidates<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheCandidates">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Rather than jumping right to another SUV, I wanted to explore all my options. I had only minor complaints about the Forester, and so I suspected a similar vehicle would check all my boxes, but I did not want to rule anything out without doing my due diligence. I have since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">formalized the process of choosing an expedition rig</a>. At the time, I considered just four options: a car, a truck, a van, and an SUV.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ACar">A Car<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ACar">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Although I had set my sights on a larger and more capable vehicle, the idea of owning a small car did appeal to me for three reasons. First, I could buy one for half the price of almost anything else. That has an undeniable draw: less money spent toward a loan means more for adventures. I could also choose something sporty; like Ricky Bobby, I wanna go fast, too. I also liked the idea of an efficient vehicle. Compared to a truck or mid-size SUV, a small car could get up to twice as many miles to the gallon, which would cut my gas bill in half. Again, more money for adventuring. I could also get to most places on a paved road, so maybe off-road prowess did not matter as much as I thought it did. These made for a convincing argument, but I did not want to wake up five years later hoping for a decent trade-in on a $20,000 investment. I knew that if I went this route, I would regret it for the same reasons I did not want to keep the Forester, and so I kept searching.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ATruck">A Truck<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ATruck">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I also thought about getting a full-size truck. Plenty of storage space, and enough power to pull or carry anything else I might need, sounded like a great idea. These vehicles can also handle almost any terrain. At over $50,000 for my target model, though, before taxes and dealer fees, I could not justify getting one. At the time I saw no reason to buy a truck without an absurd amount of power, and so while I could have chosen something smaller and saved some money, I decided that at that point I might as well just get a mid-size SUV with a shorter wheelbase and more internal cargo space. Today I would spend more time considering a Tacoma or something similar, but I stand by my initial choice.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="AVan">A Van<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AVan">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I briefly considered a van, too. Although at the time I had not yet discovered the VanLife movement, I reasoned that a large van could fill the role of a small RV. The idea seemed interesting but too far-fetched to work, and so I moved on without investing much time into it. Had I known then what I do today, I would think much harder about this, too. This may be the easiest and cheapest way to sustain lengthy adventures in the long-term, in all but the most inhospitable environments.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="AnSUV">An SUV<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AnSUV">#</a></span></h4>

<p>With that, I had come full-circle back to an SUV. Priced near the middle of the pack, I would save versus a truck while also getting a vehicle capable of tackling tough off-road terrain, with enough space to live out of during an expedition. I would also have to spend the least amount of time, energy, and resources transforming an SUV from a showroom model to a viable backcountry adventure platform. I felt this type of vehicle would best suit my needs, and so I began narrowing my search from here.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="FindingtheBestVehicle">Finding the Best Vehicle<span>&nbsp;<a href="#FindingtheBestVehicle">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Consumers tend to allow the wrong factors to influence this process. Blind loyalty, because their family has always driven a certain brand. Nationalism, as if the parent company&#8217;s owners&#8217; nationality ought to influence one of the most expensive investments they will ever make. Fuel efficiency when gas prices peak, yet casual disregard for it when they fall. Marketing campaigns. Fad technologies. People buy cars for all sorts of bad reasons, but I wanted to do better. How could I strip away folk wisdom, ignorance, and short-sightedness, though? How could I ignore all the tired tropes, and the flashy accessories, to find vehicles whose cost best matched their worth? I could do this by focusing not on the sticker price, a figure the manufacturer believes most consumers will value their product at because of the factors above, but rather by focusing on reliability and longevity&#160;&#8212;&#160;two metrics I could approximate as one, by examining resale value. Years down the road, when they have traded those ephemeral criteria for meaningful ones, the amount of money the average person will exchange for a given vehicle is a much better measure of its actual worth. This is the criterion by which I began narrowing my search.</p>

<p>For new cars, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/">Kelley Blue Book</a> and sites like <a href="https://www.nadaguides.com/">NADA Guides</a> track the manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price, the actual invoice paid by the dealerships, and where&#160;&#8212;&#160;in that range&#160;&#8212;&#160;buyers tend to fall. For used cars they also estimate trade-in value, on top of the typical range one can expect when purchasing from a dealer or private party. This is phenomenal information to have in a negotiation. Buyers can also use this information to see approximate resale value over time. How valuable does the average consumer consider this vehicle versus its original sticker price after three years? How about five? Every year these stats get summarized in a handy article. Check them out here, if you feel curious: <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/archive/best-resale-value-awards-2010/">2010</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/archive/best-resale-value-awards-2011/">2011</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2012/">2012</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2013/">2013</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2017/">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2018/">2018</a>, and <a href="https://www.kbb.com/new-cars/best-resale-value-awards/best-resale-top-10-cars-2019/">2019</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2010, Toyota and Jeep have dominated these lists. In particular, the FJ Cruiser until it got discontinued in 2014, then the Tacoma, the 4Runner, and the Wrangler. I had already ruled out mid-size trucks like the Tacoma, so I took it out of the running. My final decision came down to three factors. First, I had not heard good things about the Jeep as a daily driver. Its roots stretch back to the Army&#8217;s need for an ultra-capable off-road vehicle in World War II, and none question its prowess in that environment; on the pavement, out of its element, a mechanic friend of mine and another long-time owner both recommended I get something else. Price also concerned me: a base Wrangler with similar options as the 4Runner would have set me back about $10,000 more. Toyota&#8217;s spot at the top of the resale charts, year after year, sealed the deal; I started shopping for a 4Runner.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TrimmingItOut">Trimming It Out<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TrimmingItOut">#</a></span></h3>

<p>At the time, Toyota sold six versions of the 4Runner. Disregarding the luxury trim levels left me with just three models: the SR5, the Off-Road, and the TRD Pro. The SR5 lacked Toyota&#8217;s impressive Crawl Control, a locking rear differential, and a 4x4 drivetrain&#160;&#8212;&#160;all basic necessities for venturing off the pavement. The Pro boasted a slick interior and better suspension, but I did not care about leather seats and planned to install aftermarket suspension anyway; I chose the TRD Off-Road and saved about $6,000. Next, I had to decide whether to buy used or new.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="NewVersusUsed">New Versus Used<span>&nbsp;<a href="#NewVersusUsed">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Almost no one recommends new cars. Their value drops by thousands as soon as they leave the lot, and 10% per year after that. The best hold 60% of their original value at sixty months; most do not get anywhere near that figure. This applies to most vehicles, but less so to those at the top of the resale pack: on average, 4Runners depreciate at about 5.5%. This made the prospect of buying one from 2013 for $27,000, with the average odometer already over 70,000, less appealing. I would have also had a hard time getting a loan for that amount for a used vehicle, as a college student without a job and with mediocre credit. I applied for one loan and got a counteroffer for half the amount at over 10% interest. Had I decided to get something else, I may have gotten something used; I chose to get a 4Runner, though, and in this case, the savings did not justify several years and tens of thousands of miles of unknown use. I also had no plans to sell my new car, which meant minimizing this &#8220;loss&#8221; did not play as big a role in this process as it could have.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheBuyingProcess">The Buying Process<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheBuyingProcess">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Once I knew what I wanted, I went to my local Toyota dealership. It should not have surprised me that if you show up wanting a vehicle with reasonable evidence that you can pay for it, the salesmen work pretty hard to get you into that car; about a week after my first visit, I drove off the lot in a 2018 Toyota 4Runner. I feel like I could have gotten it for a lower price, but as a college student, I also had mediocre credit and no job at the time. The dealership financed the entire purchase. I chose to do this rather than make a down payment to keep money in my bank account. I paid about halfway between Dealer Invoice and MSRP, which I can live with. I plan to have it paid off by mid-2021, about a year before the loan comes to term, which reduces the amount of interest I will end up paying.</p>

<br />

<p>I believe I made the best choice possible given the resources at my disposal, the adventures I had in mind, and my approach to travel at the time. Had I known more about the VanLife movement, I would have thought much harder about a van; with more time, money, and expertise at my disposal, I might have turned a mid-size truck into a small adventure camper. I may still explore those routes one day; until then, though, I will continue my journey down this path in one of the most capable vehicles on the road.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Once, while camping, I used the Forester to pull a small trailer through a copse of trees toward a small shelter. Later that night, when I discovered inches-deep ruts leading back to the main road, I realized that part-way through my ride I had buried the SUV up to its frame in mud. At the time, I had not even noticed.</p>

<p>Stewart Brand, with a fascinating look at the results of conservation efforts amidst cries that the sky is falling:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The trends are favourable. Conservation efforts often appear in the media like a series of defeats and retreats, but as soon as you look up from the crisis-of-the-month, you realise that, in aggregate, conservation is winning. The ecologist Stuart Pimm at Duke University in North Carolina claims that conservationists have already reduced the rate of extinction by 75 per cent. Getting the world&#8217;s extinction rate back down to normal is a reasonable goal for this century. Restoring full natural bioabundance in most of the world will take longer, however. It would mean bringing wildlife populations back up to the marvellous level of ecological richness that existed before human impact. That could be a two-century goal.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could all do with a bit less alarmism, and a bit more reality in its place.</p>

The fact that anyone would use this as evidence that Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system is somehow unsafe blows my mind.

<p>At over 16,000 words, Tim Urban has <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html">some good advice for choosing a career</a>. Back in college, I used to shake my head at all the lost students around me. One of my friends said it was unrealistic to expect kids, fresh out of high school, to know what they wanted to do for the rest of their lives. I argued that eighteen years was <em>plenty</em> of time to figure that out, because it&#8217;s not that hard:</p>

<p>Start with things you like, narrow your scope to things you do well, then filter based on viable careers. Smack that list with a hard reality check. Take those that managed to hang on, set them aside, and do some introspection. Identify your goals first, so you can rule out paths that will not get you to them. Hopefully a few careers remain. Identify what drives you last, so you can highlight the paths that will make you happy in the long run. Sort the few that remain by the amount of time and effort it would take you to get into that field and then become successful. </p>

<p>High school students should do this <em>before</em> they graduate high school, not after spending years and tens of thousands of dollars on a degree just to to abandon it partway through&#160;&#8212;&#160;or worse, after spending years and tens of thousands of dollars on no degree, in an undeclared major, just to drop out to learn a trade. Choosing a career is not complex, nor even hard. Society does young adults a great disservice by telling them it is, and by allowing them to put off important life decisions until well into their 20s.</p>

<p>Patrick George over at Jalopnik <a href="https://jalopnik.com/i-ve-been-thinking-about-picking-up-an-old-4runner-or-l-1837864980">posted a picture</a> of a Toyota BXD20 the other day, and I had to check it out. Kinja <a href="https://oppositelock.kinja.com/m-e-g-a-the-rarest-toyota-on-this-side-of-the-world-a-1822806540">had a nice article about the vehicle</a>. I would not say no to a BXD, but given the chance to build on a platform like this, I would just go with a similar AM General Humvee. AM General has built almost 10,000 per year since 1984 for militaries around the world, which has proven the vehicle&#8217;s reliability and made it readily available for cheap. With a few modifications, like <a href="https://www.flashoffroad.com/Improvements/Lockers/Eaton/EatonLockers.htm">locking differentials</a>, I would have a similar rig for much less time and money.</p>

<p>Josef Adamcik wrote a neat how-to on building a custom USB cable. It looks great. I can see myself doing something like this, maybe for <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">my RV build</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://josef-adamcik.cz/electronics/buiding-a-custom-keyboard-katana60.html">building my own keyboard</a>, though, not so much.

<p>What a cool idea from TJ Holowaychuk. For a while before I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">re-released First Crack</a>, my static blog engine, I used a custom Node.js frontend to serve my site. I ended up overhauling the project to build a static website instead, but I could have just used this neat trick instead.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-09-09 08:33:21-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-09.html">09</a>/09 08:33:21 EST</time>
<p>I first heard about Bollinger&#8217;s B1 and B2 electric off-road vehicles <a href="https://gearpatrol.com/2017/07/28/electric-suv-bollinger-b1-sut-photos-live-reveal-bronco-jeep-competitor/">back</a> in <a href="http://www.valetmag.com/living/gear/2017/bollinger-all-electric-suv-073117.php">July</a>. Their simple construction and classic, Land Rover-esq aesthetic sucked me right in. According to electrek, the company plans to unveil prototypes and pricing <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/08/26/bollinger-electric-pickup-truck-b1-utility-truck-b2-price-prototypes/amp/">this month</a>. The Rivian R1T <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/350210/rivian-r1t-electric-camper-overland-expo/">stole the show at Overland Expo earlier this year</a>, but as far as electric overland vehicles go, I am much more excited to see what Bollinger can bring to market. Their platforms will give builders much more freedom to craft <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">the perfect adventure rig</a> than any vehicle we have seen thus far, and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-buy-and-import-a-rig.html">no matter what we buy</a>, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re all after here.</p>

<p>Full credit to Alex Armstrong and <a href="https://alexarmstrong.net/2015/01/pushing-to-multiple-git-repos">his helpful article</a> for reminding me how to do this every time I start a new project. So I can better keep track of this, though, these five lines will create a local Git repo, tie GitHub and Bitbucket remote repos to it, and then push to both.</p>

<pre class='shell'>
git init
git remote add origin {GitHub repo URL} # Get GitHub repo URL
git remote set-url --add --push origin {GitHub repo URL} # Get GitHub repo URL
git remote set-url --add --push origin {Bitbucket repo URL} # Get Bitbucket repo URL
git add .; git commit -m "Initial commit."; git push
</pre>

<p>These simple commands make sure that for all my projects, I have a local copy, a local backup, a cloud backup, and two more off-site copies of all my work&#160;&#8212;&#160;just in case.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-09-05 07:09:55-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-09.html">09</a>/05 07:09:55 EST</time>
<p>The Valuable Dev <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/developer-stress-management/">has some good tips for stress management</a>. I will write an in-depth article about my own strategies at some point, but in brief:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go home. My job moved me across the country. Going home a few times a year helps keep me grounded, and reminds me about what actually matters.</li>
<li>Make friends at work. Love &#8216;em or hate &#8217;em, you will spend more time with your coworkers than almost anyone else. At least learn to like them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about the things you can&#8217;t control. Don&#8217;t worry about the things you can, either. You have limited mental bandwidth, so use it well: <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/wicked-problems.html">just act</a>.</li>
<li>Have a routine. Especially if you have zero control over your schedule at work, have a routine for those other hours. Save your mental bandwidth for the important things.</li>
<li>Eat well. Garbage in, garbage out.</li>
<li>Exercise often. Find a way to clear your head: some people like to run or cycle or swim&#160;&#8212;&#160;I like to put a five hundred pound bar on my back.</li>
<li>Have a hobby. Find a way to engage your brain for things other than work. I sit at a computer all day, then go home, open my laptop, and write or code all evening. Even this gives me a break from the type of work I do at my job, though, which helps me unwind. For even more of a break, I do something with my hands, like Legos or woodworking.</li>

</ul>

<p>A <em>friend</em> of mine used to pirate all sorts of things. He didn&#8217;t realize it at the time, but he grew up in the golden age of piracy: Napster had proven the idea just a few years ago, and sites like The Pirate Bay and Kickass Torrents had since stepped in to keep the dream alive and well. Fast-forward to today, though, and most of those sites have shut down. The Pirate Bay still manages to <a href="https://www.newidea.com.au/pirate-bay-what-happened-are-there-any-alternatives">limp along</a>, but copyright laws and watchful Internet Service Providers have made piracy a mere shadow of its former self. As for my friend, now he pays for a basic Netflix subscription each month to watch a few shows&#160;&#8212;&#160;but for the most part, nothing replaced all that content he once pirated. As Antino Kim, Atanu Lahiri, Debabrata Dey, and Gerald Kane <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/just-enough-piracy-can-be-a-good-thing/">point out in MIT&#8217;s Sloan Management Review</a>, that may not actually be the clear win most would have you believe.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-09-02 08:19:35-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-09.html">09</a>/02 08:19:35 EST</time>
<p>I have done a bit of work on First Crack <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0719.html">since last month&#8217;s update</a>. It&#8217;s time I shared it with you.  </p>

<h2 class="headers" id="AugustActivity">August Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AugustActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>First, the things I did in August.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AddedsupportforMarkdowntables">Added support for Markdown tables<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AddedsupportforMarkdowntables">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I have written for over a decade without needing to use a table. That need presented itself this month in an as of yet unpublished article. Rather than taking a few seconds to insert one in HTML, I spent much longer adding support for Markdown tables. Even <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/">the extended Markdown spec</a> does not allow for anything more than basic rows and columns, so neither does First Crack. I thought about trying to create a syntax of my own, for things like multi-column headers and footers, but at that point I might as well just use HTML.</p>

<p>First Crack now supports basic tables. As any implementation of the Markdown spec should, First Crack also allows for arbitrary HTML code to cover more complex use cases.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Exploredconcurrency">Explored concurrency<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Exploredconcurrency">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I have a huge backlog of articles in Instapaper. One of them, <a href="https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/">on using concurrency to speed up Python programs</a>, pushed me to do some <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/performance-matters.html">premature optimization</a>. First Crack read a thousand text files, then turned them into a website of over a thousand web pages in under two seconds. This seemed like a prime candidate for concurrency. I tried threading first, thinking that it would help my engine as an I/O-bound program, but this slowed it down. No luck. I tried multiprocessing next, which helps CPU-bound programs execute faster by splitting tasks up between multiple cores. With almost no real work, this change cut runtime by over 10%. A nice, easy win. </p>

<p>The code review I did as part of this process lead to some other optimizations. Taken together, all these changes cut First Crack&#8217;s runtime by almost 30%. It now builds this site, with over a thousand pages, in less than one second.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Createdusagevignettes">Created usage vignettes<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Createdusagevignettes">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I have wanted to make some animated GIFs for a while now, as a way to showcase First Crack&#8217;s simplicity, ease of use, and speed. I got to this in August. The readme now contains a handful of quick vignettes that cover installation, setup, and usage. I used <a href="https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer/blob/master/README.md">Terminalizer</a> to make them, and they turned out great.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AddedExplorepage">Added "Explore" page<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AddedExplorepage">#</a></span></h3>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/exploring-a-website.html">Elliot Costa</a> made a great point in <a href="https://elliott.computer/exploring-the-vastness-of-a-website/"><em>Exploring the vastness of a website</em></a>: platforms seek to focus users on a tiny sliver of content&#160;&#8212;&#160;to drive high engagement at precise targets. Explore pages, on the other hand, he argued, &#8220;are unique in that they unearth things that are not necessarily the most popular or the most recent.&#8221; I like this idea, a lot, and so I added it to First Crack in August. Now, every time I build the site, First Crack chooses three articles at random for the <a href="/explore.html">Explore</a> page. This helps unearth old, unpopular posts that&#160;&#8212;&#160;left alone&#160;&#8212;&#160;no one would ever read again.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Improvedcommandlineinterface">Improved command line interface<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Improvedcommandlineinterface">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I wanted to add some output styling to a work project, but the <a href="http://pueblo.sourceforge.net/doc/manual/ansi_color_codes.html">ANSI color codes</a> just would not work. A quick search lead me to an awesome article by Li Haoyi called <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html"><em>Build your own Command Line with ANSI escape codes</em></a>. His post gave me just what I needed, and pushed me to make First Crack&#8217;s command line interface a bit better by adding support for cursor navigation. It took some fiddling, but thanks to <a href="https://pastebin.com/7YpKyKPe">a helpful tip from commenter dkrmr</a>, I got it working.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="SeptemberPlan">September Plan<span>&nbsp;<a href="#SeptemberPlan">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I plan to focus on these areas in September, 2019. I carried most of these over from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0719.html">last month&#8217;s update</a>, some of which I carried over from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">June&#8217;s update</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would still like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser. Low priority, but something I want to get done nonetheless.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to release my Markdown parser as its own project. I still have some bugs to work out, though, I want to go public with greater coverage of the spec, and I would like to add the ability to parse multi-line strings and entire files at once.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to outline the peculiarities of my implementation of the Markdown spec. This would cover weird edge cases for the most part, but documenting these shortfalls would still have value so that those who use my engine will have some sort of explanation for why their article looks weird, and so that I may one day fix them. I made some progress here this month, but not enough for a finished product.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImproveDocumentation">Improve Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImproveDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did some work on the documentation this month, but as always, I could do more. Again, a few of the ways I think I can improve the README in particular: </p>

<ul>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, I want to highlight this.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build. </li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too. </li>
</ul>

<p>I got a few things done. Again, though, I have a lot of work ahead of me. I look forward to it.</p>

<p>I used to live in the preparedness space. I found <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80001101">Doomsday Preppers</a> late one night in college, and despite a sensational portrayal of some already sensational people, I got hooked. I spent the next two years <a href="https://survivalblog.com/how-do-you-find-a-good-survival-retreat-property-by-d-r-in-tn/">reading</a> <a href="https://www.shtfplan.com/strategic-relocation/skousen-on-strategic-relocation-an-expanded-western-relocation-zone_05092014">prepper</a> <a href="https://readynutrition.com/resources/will-your-moral-values-survive-the-end-of-the-world_10022015/">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.thesurvivalpodcast.com">listening</a> to their <a href="https://survivalistprepper.net">podcasts</a>, stashing supplies, and building a bug-out bag. I even wrote <a href="/projects.html#myBook">a book</a> about it all. Preparedness fell to the wayside when I left college, though, until nutnfancy&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ita9jMrRLX0">three</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIXg7WAvp_w">part</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIXg7WAvp_w">series</a> pulled me back in. </p>

<p>I will keep this recap&#160;&#8212;&#160;and my critiques&#160;&#8212;&#160;brief. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ita9jMrRLX0">First</a>, nutnfancy talks about principles for a bug-out kit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIXg7WAvp_w">Part two</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/PIXg7WAvp_w?t=78">recaps</a><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that hour-long video before moving on to his pack of choice, a wheeled duffel that doubles as a backpack. He delves into its contents&#160;&#8212;&#160;almost a hundred pounds of gear, for the most part inessential&#160;&#8212;&#160;in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OF89kc6ZZI">third</a>. If I had to condense my critiques, I would say choosing not to focus on the essentials cost him mobility, at which point he started excusing the product rather than revisiting the flawed approach in a cycle that resulted in a bag he struggles to lift. I would not want to drag this kit through an airport, the one place a heavy roller bag belongs, let alone through the woods after a disaster. I cannot see that going well, and the fact that he does boggles my mind. Although better than his last idea, a rolling garbage can full of supplies that outweighed him, that sets the bar pretty low. Enough of all that, though: I want to talk about how I built a better system, starting with the why.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="WhyYouShouldHaveaBugOutBag">Why You Should Have a Bug-Out Bag<span>&nbsp;<a href="#WhyYouShouldHaveaBugOutBag">#</a></span></h3>

<p>In short, you should build a bug-out bag because you might have to leave without notice. For most people, I point to natural disasters like wildfires and hurricanes. If a firefighter forces you to leave in the middle of the night, you grab a few things on your way out the door. When a hurricane changes course and you have an hour to get away, you spend it getting ahead of the people cramming stuff into their trunks&#160;&#8212;&#160;not packing yours. A bug-out bag&#160;&#8212;&#160;a small kit with enough supplies to get you from the onset of disaster to a safe place&#160;&#8212;&#160;will take you from point A to B, and meet your basic needs for at least a few days once there. </p>

<p>For those who have spent a while in the preparedness space, reasons to have a go-bag become more abstract, and the circumstances in which they might use one become more dire. I tell these people to always do what improves their odds of survival. In most cases, that means staying put. Stay home with all that food, water, and gear, as long as that proves less dangerous than leaving. Past that point, though, I tell them to get out&#160;&#8212;&#160;flee to a bug-out location where they can ride out even long-term disasters. A bug-out bag should get them to that safe place, over or through anything and anyone that stands in their way.</p>

<p>Before you build a bug-out bag, you have to decide where you sit on that spectrum. Do you believe that war, economic hardship, or political strife could cause the rule of law to collapse? That if it does, you would have to get your family away from all that chaos to keep them safe? Or do you foresee natural disasters sending you away for a few days at a time? Your answer will decide your priorities, and guide what you put in this kit. I fall into the former camp, so I built my bug-out bag to get me through anything, on foot, in any season, for up to five days. I list its contents below.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyBugOutBag">My Bug-Out Bag<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyBugOutBag">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Non-highlighted items stay in my pack. I add items in green in the summer, orange in the fall, and blue in the winter. At its heaviest, loaded with extra layers and two sleeping bags for frigid winters, my pack weighs about 35 pounds. During the summer, when I can get away with less, it drops to under 30. A rifle, sling, seven mags, and 210 rounds of ammo add less than 17. At over 200 pounds, I never have to carry more than a quarter of my body weight&#160;&#8212;&#160;and for a few months each year, that fraction drops from 1/4 to 1/6.</p>

<p>I have an article in the works that delves into each item: all the things I tried, what I chose and why, and how much it all cost. I will leave that for another day. Today, I want to speak in broad strokes about what I included&#160;&#8212;&#160;and left out&#160;&#8212;&#160;and why.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Food">Food<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Food">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I steered clear of shelf-stable foods like MREs, packaged meats, and instant meals. These lack calories, take up too much space, and weigh far too much. I chose food bars even over freeze-dried meals to save weight and space: for every two days, this saves me over a pound. I would enjoy a sausage and egg breakfast more, but I value a small and light pack the most.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Water">Water<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Water">#</a></span></h4>

<p>SOURCE&#8217;s neat quick connect system made adding a Sawyer filter between the bladder and mouthpiece easy, and Aquamira drops can purify the entire bladder&#8217;s three liters at once. These total a few ounces, make refills easy, and cleans water as well as any man-portable system could. Do not kid yourself into thinking you need more.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Clothing">Clothing<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Clothing">#</a></span></h4>

<p>The &lt;a href=&#8220;https://matadorup.com/products/matador-freerain24-backpack?variant=47744934037&#8221;&gt;Matador Freerain&lt;/a&gt; has my bug-out outfit: hiking boots, pants, wool socks, wicking underwear, and a good shirt. I have a spare set of socks and underwear in my bug-out bag, but nothing else. I chose quality, sturdy, and fast-drying clothes that I could wear for a few days, so that I could get away without spares. Again, I value a small and light pack, and I do not kid myself into thinking I need more than I do.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Shelter">Shelter<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Shelter">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Lighter tents exist, but lighter, free-standing, double-wall tents with enough space to shelter two people and their bug-out bags do not.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Medical">Medical<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Medical">#</a></span></h4>

<p>At eight pounds, my medical kit weighs more than any other single item. In return, it gives me the ability to handle splinters all the way up to a gunshot wounds. </p>

<h4 class="headers" id="WeaponsandAmmunition">Weapons and Ammunition<span>&nbsp;<a href="#WeaponsandAmmunition">#</a></span></h4>

<p>If you plan to hunt during your bug-out, pack a .22 and a bunch of ammo. I don&#8217;t, so I stuck with a basic combat loadout. If the scenario warrants it, I can afford to add a few more mags and a couple boxes of ammo&#160;&#8212;&#160;because I focused on building a small and light bug-out bag everywhere else.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Energy">Energy<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Energy">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I have lit a fire in the rain with cotton balls soaked in Vaseline and a ferrocerium rod. Those who have more than one fire starter need better starters, better training, or both. As for lighting, spend enough time in the dark woods and you will realize that you don&#8217;t need it. I chose two small headlamps just in case, but I don&#8217;t plan on using them.</p>

<br />

<p>Should I have more in my bug-out bag? Maybe. Less? I doubt it. Do I need more, though? I can answer that question with certainty: no. You might&#160;&#8212;&#160;maybe you need an eighty pound roller duffel to drag through the sand while you flee to the mountains for a week or two, along with everyone else who has the bright idea to hole up in those peaks. I bet you don&#8217;t, though, and I hope this will convince you to build a better bug-out bag. Your life, and the lives of those you hold most dear, may one day depend on it.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Clarified and condensed from <a href="https://youtu.be/PIXg7WAvp_w?t=78">1:18</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/PIXg7WAvp_w?t=224">3:44</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIXg7WAvp_w">part two</a> in nutnfancy&#8217;s bug-out kit series, the principles that guided the creation of his bug-out kit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not romanticize bug-out scenarios. They will involve carrying heavy bags long distances under extraordinary stress, not Hollywood-style gunfights to a nearby fortress you can hold out in until everything calms down. Do not bug-out unless you have to.</li>
<li>Tailor each kit to its owner. Each should be self-contained and complete.</li>
<li>A bug-out kit is a survival kit. Prioritize shelter, water, and food&#160;&#8212;&#160;everything else is extra. You are trying to survive, not live in comfort or save the world. Many different scenarios could lead to a bug-out, so do not try to prepare for everything. Focus on the bare necessities to carry you through.</li>
<li>Size and weight constraints should govern every decision you make.</li>
<li>Once something goes into your bug-out bag, it never comes out. This is the &#8220;you are dead to me&#8221; principle.</li>
<li>Everything is disposable. If you have to throw away everything to survive, do it. Maybe you can come back to it later, or maybe you can resupply from a cache somewhere down the road. </li>
<li>Bug-out kit should be a wheeled conveyance, and secondarily a backpack</li>
<li>Keep a journal, because rule of law will eventually be re-established.</li>

</ul>

<p>I like seeing passionate people talk about their craft, and Carl Medlock has a passion for Tesla Roadsters. This story reminded me of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvm3z5/rich-rebuilds-tesla-repair-and-salvage">Rich Benoit rebuilding his own Tesla</a>. When I want to get away from my screen I stick with woodworking for the most part, but I would love to get into this sort of work. I can <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">build out my car</a>, but I would love to do more.</p>

<p>I wanted to add some terminal output styling to a work project, but the <a href="http://pueblo.sourceforge.net/doc/manual/ansi_color_codes.html">ANSI color codes</a> just would not work. A quick search lead me to this awesome article by Li Haoyi, <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html"><em>Build your own Command Line with ANSI escape codes</em></a>. His post gave me just what I needed, and pushed me to make <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>&#8217;s command line interface a bit better by adding support for cursor navigation. It took some fiddling, but thanks to <a href="https://pastebin.com/7YpKyKPe">a helpful tip from commenter dkrmr</a>, I got it working.</p>

<p>I did not plan on linking to his article, but after referencing it for two days, I came around. Li pulls off some pretty cool stuff with some pretty basic tools. Very cool.</p>

<p>I have a lot of thoughts about choosing an expedition rig. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">I went over them before</a>, so I won&#8217;t repeat myself here. On the topic of a van for between $100,000 and $200,000, though, I will say this: as prices for these vehicles climb, do not forget to consider the other rigs ever-higher price points make viable. If you plan to spend $60,000 on a cool van but come to terms with shelling out $200,000 for Sportsmobile&#8217;s beast, take stock of what else that $200,000 might get you before you pull the trigger. At this point you have gotten into <a href="https://earthcruiser.com/">EarthCruiser</a> territory, and as cool as the Sportsmobile Classic may be, I would rather the former.</p>

<p>I like Elliott Cost&#8217;s idea, a lot: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A feed is based around time, usually sorted reverse chronologically, whereas an explore page reveals the expansiveness of a website by pulling from disparate sources, indifferent to time, allowing one to jump into the depths of something entirely new.&#8221;</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-08-19 18:12:43-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-08.html">08</a>/19 18:12:43 EST</time>
<p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about expedition rigs. I started looking for the perfect one to see if I could find something better than the 4Runners and Tacomas <a href="https://www.xoverland.com/">Expedition Overland</a> uses. Less than a year later, I bought a 4Runner. I resumed my search a few months later, and almost bought an RV instead of a house. As a home owner I have started searching again&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this time, I decided to talk about my process. I hope this guide will help those looking for adventure choose the right platform for their way of life.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="ANoteonTerms">A Note on Terms<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ANoteonTerms">#</a></span></h2>

<p>When I hear &#8220;expedition rig&#8221;, I think of the vehicles <a href="http://www.expeditions7.com/segments/greenland">Expeditions7 drove across Greenland</a>, and the monsters <a href="https://unicat.net">UNICAT builds in Europe</a>. These get large groups of people almost anywhere for long periods of time. &#8220;Adventure rig&#8221;, to me, lives somewhere between those and a daily driver&#160;&#8212;&#160;think of the ones <a href="http://www.mountainstateoverland.com/">Mountain State Overland</a> uses to explore the Northeast. These take smaller groups almost anywhere for shorter periods of time. Here, though, I use the two terms to mean the same thing. Anything can take you on an adventure, and you can turn it into an expedition by going just a bit farther, and staying out a little longer. I wrote this guide to help you find the vehicle that will get you out there, no matter where and how long you want to go. For this, that distinction makes little sense, and so I do not make it here.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="Step1">Step 1: Create a List of Requirements<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step1">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Start your search by creating a list of requirements. I tend to get caught up in cool new things. The car buff and gear nerd in me sees the latest, greatest rig, and I tend to obsess over it for a while. I have learned to curb that impulse over time, though, by thinking back to this list. My answers to a few key questions help me stay focused on the vehicle that will best serve my needs, and avoid getting caught up in cool new toys. Everyone searching for the best adventure platform should start with spending some time thinking about these questions. Hat-tip to <a href="https://twoifoverland.com/connect/">Martin and Bethany</a> for <a href="https://twoifoverland.com/selecting-the-right-expedition-chassis/">the idea</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where do you want to go?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How long do you want to stay there?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How much do you want to take?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How large do you want to be?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at each in detail. Record your answers so that you can revise them over time, and so that those you adventure with can have a say in the rig&#8217;s requirements.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="1Wheredoyouwanttogo">1. Where do you want to go?<span>&nbsp;<a href="#1Wheredoyouwanttogo">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I put this question first because it can negate this entire process. I spent my first twenty-two years traveling in vans. A Dodge Grand Caravan, a Honda Odyssey, and a Chevy Equinox got me up and down the East Coast, and some old Toyotas and Mitsubishis and Isuzus took me across Africa and Mongolia. If you just want to get to parks and trail heads and down a few dirt roads, almost any vehicle will work. Your answer could also narrow the scope of your search: few vehicles can handle rock crawling, so if you plan on that, you have little left to decide. An honest look at where you want to go might help you avoid spending a lot of time and money here, which means more of both for adventuring.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="2Howlongdoyouwanttostaythere">2. How long do you want to stay there?<span>&nbsp;<a href="#2Howlongdoyouwanttostaythere">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would have put this question first, but an honest answer to #1 will save so many people so much time and money that I had to start there. I cannot overstate the importance of this question, though, as one of the most often overlooked criterion for choosing the right adventure platform.</p>

<p>Even if you do not plan to go anywhere extreme, the amount of time you want to stay there may still push you toward more capable platforms. I once tried to pack enough gear for a multi-week camping trip into a Chevy Cruze. A much larger Chevy Equinox just fit it all, and I had to unpack and then re-pack almost everything every night. Think about how long you want to stay out before heading back into town, and how that will affect the amount of gear, water, food, and fuel you must take. Your answer may rule out many of the vehicles that made it past the first screening criterion above, or show you that a little car just might work after all.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="3Howmuchdoyouwanttotake">3. How much do you want to take?<span>&nbsp;<a href="#3Howmuchdoyouwanttotake">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Your answer to questions one and two will give you an idea of the minimum gear, water, food, and fuel this rig must carry. Also think about anything else you would like to pack, and any amenities you would like to have. A truck, for example, might handle the basics, but if you want a full bathroom, you have to pick something else. If you decided a car would work for weekend trips to the coast, but also want to bring surfboards and sea kayaks, you need a bigger vehicle.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="4Howlargedoyouwanttobe">4. How large do you want to be?<span>&nbsp;<a href="#4Howlargedoyouwanttobe">#</a></span></h3>

<p>As your list of requirements grows, so will the size of the rig that satisfies it. <a href="https://camperreport.com/best-rv-length-for-national-parks/">Jim Harmer put together a great breakdown of RV length limits for State and National Parks</a>, so if you might go that route, check his article out. If you want to ship your rig overseas, plan to go smaller. Trail running and rock crawling will restrict you the most, in both size and weight. Set some sensible limits now and exceed them with care.</p>

<p>At the end of this process, you should have a list of requirements that looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do I want to go? <strong>Up and down the East Coast.</strong></li>
<li>How long do I want to stay there? <strong>Weekends for the most part, but up to a week.</strong></li>
<li>How much do I want to take? <strong>Food and water to last a weekend. Camping and hiking gear.</strong></li>
<li>How large do I want to be? <strong>Small enough to drive in cities in the Northeast.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>My list looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do I want to go? <strong>North America in general, and Canada and Alaska in particular.</strong></li>
<li>How long do I want to stay there? <strong>As long as possible, but at least one week between refits.</strong></li>
<li>How much do I want to take? <strong>Food, water, and energy to last at least a week. Basic amenities, like a shower and running water, to make long-term trips viable.</strong></li>
<li>How large do I want to be? <strong>Small enough to fit into most State and National Parks.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="headers" id="Step2">Step 2: Choose a Chassis<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step2">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Next, move on to choosing the best chassis for the job. I like to choose a chassis first and a fuel second, because the former will have a much greater impact on where you go, how long you stay there, and what you bring. A lot of overlanders get married to the idea that they must have a diesel rig, but most people will do just fine with a plain gas engine.  </p>

<p>I listed as many chassis as I could think of below, with pictures and links where possible, and notes about who I think should and should not buy each. Try not to get caught up in the idea of one perfect vehicle, when another might do a better job of serving your actual needs. You set good goals, and sensible limits, earlier; change and exceed them now with care.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Cars">Cars<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Cars">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/Car.png' alt='' title='Car silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="https://landcruisingadventure.com/4wd-a-must-2wd-overland-vehicles/">Many have done amazing trips in vehicles like these</a>, so for those who just want to get to parks and trail heads and down a few dirt roads, a car will do just fine. You could go with a more capable platform, but all the money you save in car payments and at the pump will leave more for the fun stuff.  </p>

<p>Certain people should choose a car. I wrote out a rough guide below. To those who fit the bill for the former, I hope you will think long and hard about moving on to something larger and more expensive. If any of the latter describe you, though, move on. Many try to force whatever they already have into a new role as an adventure platform&#160;&#8212;&#160;and when that fails, they give up on adventuring. Set yourself up for success. Think back to your list of requirements from earlier. Those who can meet them with a car, should&#160;&#8212;&#160;and if you can&#8217;t, keep reading.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure solo or as a pair</li>
<li>You want to take day or weekend trips</li>
<li>You want to visit parks or campgrounds</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in a group of four or more</li>
<li>You want to travel for more than a long weekend</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="SUVs">SUVs<span>&nbsp;<a href="#SUVs">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/SUV.png' alt='' title='SUV silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>The sweet spot for most people, SUVs carry more and do better off-road than cars. This means they can take you to far-flung places for medium amounts of time, but know that you cannot take much, and that you will camp while there. The folks over at Expedition Overland <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEacEr4cZy-5c3N7NUHb2dE1ffGv53H73">love this</a>; others, not so much. Again, certain people should choose an SUV. See my rough guide below.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in a group of up to four</li>
<li>You want to travel for up to a week at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit parks, campgrounds, and remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in a group of more than four</li>
<li>You want to travel for more than a week at a time</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="Trucks">Trucks<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Trucks">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/Truck.png' alt='' title='Truck silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Trucks tend to have more power than SUVs, but that may come at the cost of size, weight, and off-road ability. These vehicles can also take you to far-flung places for medium amounts of time and you will still camp while there, but you can bring more with you. </p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in a group of up to four, and need a lot of gear</li>
<li>You want to travel for up to a week at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit parks, campgrounds, and remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong> </p>
<li>You adventure in a group of more than four</li>
<li>You want to travel for more than a week at a time</li>
<li>You want to go places that involve technical off-road driving</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="Vans">Vans<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Vans">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/Van.png' alt='' title='Van silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>With so many people living in vans these days, they have proven their viability as both homes on wheels and adventure platforms. Few vehicles will beat them for one or two people a few days at a time. A second row of seats will take up a lot of that living space, though, vans eek by off-road, and they lack the weight capacity to hold food, water, and fuel for long adventures off-grid.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure solo or as a pair</li>
<li>You want to live out of your vehicle or use it as a base camp long-term</li>
<li>You want to visit parks, campgrounds, and some remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in a group of three or more</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="Sidebysides">Side-by-sides<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Sidebysides">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/UTV.png' alt='' title='Side-by-side silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I almost left these out. Side-by-sides do not have the weight or fuel capacity to support long trips, but a lot of people out west love them. For fun day trips, one might work for you.  </p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure solo or as a pair, and already have a truck and trailer to transport one</li>
<li>You want to take day or weekend trips</li>
<li>You want to explore tough trails</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in a group of three or more, or do not already have a truck and trailer to transport one</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a night at a time</li>
<li>You just want to visit parks or campgrounds</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="RecreationalVehicles">Recreational Vehicles<span>&nbsp;<a href="#RecreationalVehicles">#</a></span></h3>

<p>The classic &#8220;adventure vehicle&#8221;, RVs come in many shapes and sizes. Each suits a different type of adventure, and so I broke this class up by type.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ClassA">Class A<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ClassA">#</a></span></h4>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/ClassA.png' alt='' title='Class A silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>These bus-like monsters have the space and amenities to support large groups on multi-week trips, as long as they stay on the pavement and camp in RV parks. I like these because they can replace a house, but their size, inability to go off-road, and dependence on water, electrical, and sewage hookups limits their utility outside a narrow use case.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in mid to large groups</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips</li>
<li>You want to visit parks or campgrounds</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in small groups</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="ClassC">Class C<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ClassC">#</a></span></h4>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/ClassC.png' alt='' title='Class C silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Although Class Cs can rival Class As in size, few will. Built on large truck chassis like the Ford F350, these smaller RVs can handle rougher roads. They also have enough space and amenities to support mid-size groups on multi-week trips. These RVs still depend on water, electrical, and sewage hookups, so do not expect to stay off-grid for long. </p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in mid to large groups</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips</li>
<li>You want to visit parks, campgrounds, and some remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in small groups</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Fifthwheels">Fifth wheels<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Fifthwheels">#</a></span></h4>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/FifthWheel.png' alt='' title='Fifth wheel silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>These massive trailers have the space and amenities to support large groups on multi-week trips. Pulled by large trucks, and close to Class A RVs in size, they have similar capabilities and limitations. You can unhitch your truck and leave the trailer, though, which makes this route a bit more flexible. Park a side-by-side in the attached garage, and you get a capable base camp from which to launch some serious adventures. </p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in mid to large groups</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips with the option for serious off-road detours</li>
<li>You want to visit parks, campgrounds, and some remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in small groups</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Traveltrailers">Travel trailers<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Traveltrailers">#</a></span></h4>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/TravelTrailer.png' alt='' title='Travel trailer silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Think of travel trailers as Class Cs you tow. They have the same amenities as large RVs in a smaller package, to support mid-size groups for multi-week trips. This means you can tow them with smaller, more off-road capable vehicles, which gives you the base camp setup of the larger RVs and an overland-capable rig.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in small to mid-size groups</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips with the option for serious off-road detours</li>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in large groups</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Popuptrailers">Pop-up trailers<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Popuptrailers">#</a></span></h4>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/PopTrailer.png' alt='' title='Pop-up trailer silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Pop-up trailers have few amenities but come in the smallest package. Almost any vehicle can tow one, so although their size makes them ill-suited to large groups, a capable overland rig could tow one to make long-term camping possible with extra supplies, and more comfortable with basic amenities.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in a group of up to four</li>
<li>You want to travel for up to a week at a time with the option for serious off-road detours</li>
<li>You want to visit parks, campgrounds, and some remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in mid-size or large groups</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit remote places</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Truckcampers">Truck campers<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Truckcampers">#</a></span></h4>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/TruckCamper.png' alt='' title='Truck camper silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>The smallest of all the campers here, these sacrifice size and all but the most basic amenities to fit in the back of a truck. This truck, in turn, can go almost anywhere. Think of these campers as SUVs with interior living space, so you do not have to camp while on the trail.</p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure solo or as a pair</li>
<li>You want to travel for up to a week at a time with the option for serious off-road detours</li>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in mid-size or large groups</li>
<li>You want to stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You just want to visit parks or campgrounds</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="MediumDutyUtilityVehicles">Medium-Duty Utility Vehicles<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MediumDutyUtilityVehicles">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/MediumDuty.png' alt='' title='Medium-duty utility vehicle silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Most adventure vehicles fall into one of those six groups. As you search for the perfect fit, though, consider these two types as well. Although unusual, medium- and heavy-duty utility vehicles have a great deal to offer as expedition rigs. Built to withstand hard use in austere environments, and with the size and weight capacity to support mid to large groups on long trips, they can do things and go places unlike any other platform on this list. Equipping one will take some time and money, but go into this with an open mind&#160;&#8212;&#160;you might just like the idea.</p>

<p>Medium-duty utility vehicles, like the Mitsubishi Fuso and Isuzu N-series, have single and crew cab models to support small to mid-size groups of up to seven. Many also ship from the factory without anything on the frame except that cab, making them a blank slate upon which you can build almost anything. Some models, like the Mitsubishi FG4x4, also come equipped for off-road driving in their stock form. Although this route will take some extra time and money when compared to others here, it gives you the chance to build the perfect custom expedition rig. </p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in small to mid-size groups</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips that involve shipping your rig by boat or plane, and stay off-grid for more than a few days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit some parks and campgrounds but mostly remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in large groups</li>
<li>You just want to visit parks or campgrounds</li>
<li>You do not have the time and money to invest in a custom habitat</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="HeavyDutyUtilityVehicles">Heavy-Duty Utility Vehicles<span>&nbsp;<a href="#HeavyDutyUtilityVehicles">#</a></span></h3>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/images/ExpeditionRigs/HeavyDuty.png' alt='' title='Heavy-duty utility vehicle silhouette' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>A step up from their smaller cousins, heavy-duty utility vehicles offer even more space and carrying capacity. This comes at the cost of size and a couple miles per gallon, but opens up a world of extreme expedition rigs built to excel in harsh environments. Take the U.S. Army&#8217;s Family of Light Medium Tactical Vehicles, for example, which even in great condition sell for around $10,000. The base model, the M1078, can carry 5,000 pounds, run on almost any combustible fluid, and go anywhere its large frame will fit. Many companies and millitaries around the world have similar offerings, such as the storied UNIMOG or the MAN KAT. Building these out, too, will take some extra time and money as compared to other options here, but this gives you the chance to create the perfect expedition rig. </p>

<p><strong>Buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You adventure in mid to large groups</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips and stay off-grid for many days at a time</li>
<li>You want to visit some parks and campgrounds but mostly remote spots</li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<li>You adventure in small groups</li>
<li>You just want to visit parks or campgrounds</li>
<li>You want to take multi-week trips that involve shipping your rig by boat or plane</li>
<li>You do not have the time and money to invest in a custom habitat</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>Each group here has many awesome vehicles. I encourage you to find a class that sounds like it will work for you, and then search for the best rig within it. Most people can get away with a car. Those who want to stay out longer should go with an SUV, or an RV for the whole family. The most adventurous amongst you, who want to travel to faraway places for long periods of time, should consider something custom built atop a utility vehicle. I walk through this process below using our example list of requirements, and then a second time with my own. Once you pick a chassis, move on to choosing a fuel source.</p>

<p>Recall the list from earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do I want to go? <strong>Up and down the East Coast.</strong></li>
<li>How long do I want to stay there? <strong>Weekends for the most part, but up to a week.</strong></li>
<li>How much do I want to take? <strong>Food and water to last a weekend. Camping and hiking gear.</strong></li>
<li>How large do I want to be? <strong>Small enough to drive in cities in the Northeast.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The East Coast does not allow for much off-road driving, but <a href="https://www.drivingline.com/articles/off-roading-on-the-east-coast-vs-west-coast/">some trails do exist</a>. Assume our example person here wants to explore them. This rules out a car, a van, and Class A, Class C, and fifth wheel RVs. I would not wish driving through cities in a heavy-duty utility vehicle on anyone, so cross those out, too. Take travel trailers and side-by-sides off the list for the same reason. This leaves SUVs, trucks with or without a truck camper, pop-up trailers, and medium-duty utility vehicles. These all meet the criteria above, so trimming the list further will come down to two important questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>How much do you want to camp?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which seasons do you want to adventure in?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If our example person likes camping for long periods, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEacEr4cZy-5c3N7NUHb2dE1ffGv53H73">like the folks over at Expedition Overland</a>, their answer to #1 will do nothing to trim this list. Sticking to fair weather adventures, during the spring and fall in particular, also does not help. Any one of these chassis will serve this type of person&#8217;s needs, so I would suggest picking the one that gets them out there the soonest and for the least amount of money.</p>

<p>Suppose our example person wants a respite from nature, though. Cross out SUVs and trucks. Neither has the space to do much more than support nearby campers. If they want to adventure during the summer and winter, cross these out along with pop-up trailers: although possible, using a tent in deep northern snow or smothering southern heat makes for rough living. This leaves truck campers and medium-duty utility vehicles. Choosing the latter means investing a lot of time and money into this project for an awesome, custom adventure rig. The former costs less and sits atop a more capable vehicle, but its lack of interior living space will push its occupants outside often. Our example person would have to choose between these trade-offs. </p>

<p>Going through this process again, in a less abstract way, recall my list from earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do I want to go? <strong>North America in general, and Canada and Alaska in particular.</strong></li>
<li>How long do I want to stay there? <strong>As long as possible, but at least one week between refits.</strong></li>
<li>How much do I want to take? <strong>Food, water, and energy to last at least a week. Basic amenities, like a shower and running water, to make long-term trips viable.</strong></li>
<li>How large do I want to be? <strong>Small enough to fit into most State and National Parks.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Traveling throughout North America makes cars and side-by-sides poor choices. The remote and austere environments I want to visit in Canada and Alaska also take Class A, Class C, fifth wheel, and travel trailer RVs out of the running. Wanting to spend a week or more in those places between refits precludes vans, for mediocre off-road ability and limited cargo capacity. Lack of space and cargo capacity would also take SUVs and trucks in general out of the running, if not for the possibility of using a small trailer.</p>

<p>This leaves me with a truck (with or without a truck camper) or an SUV, paired with a small trailer. I could also choose a medium- or heavy-duty utility vehicle. Let&#8217;s revisit my two bonus questions from last time, &#8220;How much do you want to camp?&#8221; and &#8220;Which seasons do you want to adventure in?&#8221;</p>

<p>I have spent enough time in the middle of nowhere, unshowered and sleeping under the stars, to know I can do that for weeks if needed. I prefer to do it for a day or two at most. I love the outdoors but I need a break every few days, which each of these options can give me. This pushes the limits of an SUV- or truck-based setup, but I want to keep an open mind here, so I left them on my list.</p>

<p>When it comes to which seasons I want to adventure in, though, my answer rules out both SUV- and truck-based setups. I have plans for a year-long grand adventure throughout North America. Again, although possible, using a tent in deep northern snow or smothering southern heat makes for rough living. I would also like to live in this rig for a few months each year, and I do not want to limit myself to spring and fall. This leaves me with medium- and heavy-duty utility vehicles, upon which I can build a custom habitat.</p>

<p>Choosing between the two came down to size, capability, and cost. I went with a heavy-duty M1083 LMTV over a Mitsubishi FG4x4 because it allowed me to design a living space capable of carrying weeks&#8217; worth of food, water, and fuel. The entire project on the M1083 chassis will also cost about the same as buying the empty Mitsubishi chassis, after which I would have to invest a few thousand more into building out a much smaller rig. </p>

<p>The medium-duty utility vehicle&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/shipping-container-expedition-rig.html">fit inside a shipping container almost swayed me</a>. This would have made it easy to get my rig to another country, or even just to a port in Alaska. I could have got it to Europe <a href="https://moverdb.com/container-shipping/#US">for about $3,000</a>, for example. As it turns out, though, <a href="https://wheelingit.us/2018/06/07/moving-to-europe-vii-shipping-your-rv-from-usa-to-europe/">it does not cost much more to transport a full-size RV on a ship</a>. In the grand scheme of things, when considering the magnitude of a multi-continent expedition, a difference of a few hundred to a few thousand dollars matters little. This sealed the deal for me.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ANoteonBuyingvsLeasing">A Note on Buying vs Leasing<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ANoteonBuyingvsLeasing">#</a></span></h3>

<p>This should need <a href="https://www.moneyunder30.com/why-you-should-never-lease-a-car">little explanation</a>, but every once in a while I see <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2398175/best-adventuremobile-advice-no-one-ever-listens">someone try to justify leasing an adventure vehicle over buying one</a>. In brief, mileage limits, rules against excess wear and tear, and an inability to customize your vehicle should rule leasing out, regardless of the chassis you choose. If not for these reasons, consider how my car purchase shook out: I will pay my 4Runner off in just over four years, at $850 per month with no money down. A typical 36 month lease would have saved me about $400 a month, money that I would have then spent over the course of a second lease. At six years, my lease payments could have bought a new 4Runner. I bought a reliable car that holds its value, though, so instead I will spend the foreseeable future without a car payment, and years before I expect to spend much on a serious repair. Give yourself the freedom to build something great, and save yourself money in the long run, by buying your expedition rig. </p>

<h2 class="headers" id="Step3">Step 3: Choose a Fuel Source<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step3">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Again, I like to choose a chassis first and a fuel second. For the most part, the former will govern where you go, how long you stay there, and what you bring. As you start looking at lengthy and remote expeditions in particular, though, the type of fuel it runs on becomes a serious factor. Decide this next.  </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Gasoline">Gasoline<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Gasoline">#</a></span></h3>

<p>As I said earlier, a lot of overlanders get married to the idea that they must have a diesel rig. Most people will do just fine with a plain gas engine, though, which has plenty of power and sips fuel found everywhere in the Americas. For ease of use and simplicity, almost everyone should stick with gasoline as their rig&#8217;s fuel source.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Diesel">Diesel<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Diesel">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Diesel engines get a lot of credit for cranking out more power than gas. Although well-deserved, a good transmission and gearbox combo can all but close that gap. This means your choice comes down to a few key factors: efficiency, longevity, and service interval. As the more energy dense of the two, diesel can offer better range for the same storage capacity. Many also choose this fuel because these engines tend to last two to three times longer than those running on gas. They tend to go around twice as long between service intervals, too. All these upsides come at a higher initial cost, though, and higher costs at the pump. If you want to travel super long distances with few refuels and even fewer tune-ups, and have the money to pay for that, go for it.</p>

<p>Diesel does have one huge advantage over gas in custom expedition rigs, though: its ability to fuel everything. Gas can power an engine but everything else must use propane or electricity, whereas many companies offer diesel stoves, heaters, and water pumps. This simplicity has incredible value during remote, long-term expeditions in particular. If you picture yourself in a scenario where a system&#8217;s loss could have catastrophic results, think about this route as a way to reduce points of failure. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Electric">Electric<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Electric">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Electric vehicles will revolutionize the overland space. With a water filter, a cooler, and some careful planning, I can live off the grid for weeks at a time. I can burn through fifty gallons of fuel in less than a day, though, and so as fuel cells and solar panels get better, &#8220;refueling&#8221; in the field will make extreme, long-term expeditions possible for anyone. I do not see this happening any time soon, though, but I would love to have someone prove me wrong.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Other">Other<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Other">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Many automakers have at least one vehicle that runs on something else, such as natural gas. The infrastructure does not yet exist to make these fuels viable for the general public, though, let alone the small subset of people who want to explore the unknown for indeterminate periods of time. Steer clear.</p>

<br />

<p>Jumping back to our example person from earlier, who wants to travel up and down the East Cost for up to a week at a time, gas will work just fine. In my case, the M1083 runs on almost any combustible fluid. It prefers diesel, though, and so I will oblige. Bonus for me, though: this means everything can run on one fuel, so I have a little less to worry about as I cruise the backcountry.</p>

<br />

<p>As with most things, I wrote this to help clarify, condense, and record my thoughts on a tough topic. I needed to work through the complicated process of choosing an expedition rig. This framework lead me to the same conclusion I have leaned toward <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">for months now</a>, which I hope to make a reality over the next few years. In the meantime, I hope my guide helps you choose the right platform for your way of life. It&#8217;s about time you got out there.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-08-15 06:46:46-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-08.html">08</a>/15 06:46:46 EST</time>
<style>table{margin:0 auto;margin-bottom:2em;border-collapse:collapse;table-layout:fixed}table,td,th,tr{border:.1em solid #000;padding:.5em}td{color: black}td:hover{background-color:#cfcfcf}.highlight{background-color:#f4f186}</style>

<p>I have spent a lot of time researching, planning, and <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">designing</a> a full-size, custom-built expedition rig. I hope to start this massive project in the next few years. A few weeks ago, though, I took a brief detour down a different path. Rather than a huge RV based on the M1083 LMTV chassis, I spent a few days thinking I would go with a medium-duty utility vehicle instead. The Mitsubishi FG4x4 and the Isuzu N-series, I reasoned, had a few advantages over the LMTV.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ship-ability</strong> - <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/21/17764290/camper-for-sale-overland-expedition-earthcruiser">These vehicles can fit in a shipping container</a>. With some clever engineering, I could add a spacious living area to the back that would still fit in one of these containers. This would give me an expedition rig capable of long-term adventures in far-flung places, that I could ship around the world with ease.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> - With just a standing-height box and an air conditioner on top, the massive LMTV chassis maxes out the Department of Transportation&#8217;s 13&#8217;6" height limit with ease. A much smaller, medium-duty utility truck could go more places.</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong> - An empty M1083 weighs in at almost 20,000 pounds; even under max load, a Mitsubish FG4x4 tops out at 14,000 pounds. This massive difference makes recovering an LMTV more difficult and more dangerous. Recovering a fully-loaded 4Runner at 5,000 pounds takes training, care, and a bit of risk; doing the same for a vehicle up to six times as heavy requires much more of the former, and a great deal of the latter.</li>
</ul>

<p>These advantages pushed me further down this new path. I loved the idea of fitting in a shipping container in particular, so I focused on nailing down max dimensions for this type of expedition rig next.</p>

<p>This proved difficult. Most container manufacturers and shipping companies post conflicting information, so I spent the better part of a day searching for a plausible consensus. The following tables contain the results of my research. I cannot guarantee its accuracy, as I pulled it from many sources, but I did my best to cross-reference these figures before recording them here.</p>

<p>I focused on the two most common container sizes, the 20&#8216; and 40&#8217; High. I ignored 20&#8216; High cubes, because they only ship from certain ports, to certain ports. It also made little sense to include standard height 40&#8217; containers, because 40&#8216; High cubes ship at almost the same rate. If I planned for a 40&#8217; container, it made sense to take advantage of the extra height.</p>

<table>
<th abbr="Interior size" colspan="4">Interior Shipping Container Dimensions</th>
<tr>
<td>Container</td>
<td>Length</td>
<td>Width</td>
<td>Height</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20'</td>
<td>19' 5"</td>
<td>7' 6"</td>
<td>7' 5.5"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40'H</td>
<td>39' 6.5"</td>
<td>7' 8"</td>
<td>8' 5.75"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This table summarizes the door dimensions of two common shipping containers, the 20&#8216; and the 40&#8217; High. Although the actual interior dimensions are a bit larger, building a rig any bigger than this means it won&#8217;t fit through the door.</p>

<table>
<th abbr="Container weights" colspan="4">Container Weight Comparison</th>
<tr>
<td>Container</td>
<td>Base weight (lb)</td>
<td>Max weight (lb)</td>
<td>Carry capacity (lb)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20'</td>
<td>4,800</td>
<td>44,000</td>
<td class="highlight">39,200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40'H</td>
<td>8,900</td>
<td>44,500</td>
<td class="highlight">35,600</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This table summarizes the weight capacities of two common shipping containers. The 40&#8216; High container has more structural weight than the 20&#8217;, so it has a lower carrying capacity, but both will handle up to 17 tons without issue.</p>

<table>
<th abbr="FG4x4 weights" colspan="4">FG4x4 Weight Stats</th>
<tr>
<td>Chassis</td>
<td>Base weight (lb)</td>
<td>Max weight (lb)</td>
<td>Carry capacity (lb)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FG4x4</td>
<td>5,995</td>
<td class="highlight">14,050</td>
<td>8,055</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This table highlights the most an FG4x4 can weigh, including its payload. Both 20&#8216; and 40&#8217; High shipping containers can handle well over 30,000 pounds, or more than twice that max. The decision for which container a rig built atop this chassis should fit in, then, should come down to the importance of an extra 12.25&#8220; in height and 2&#8221; in width. Do not worry about weight.</p>

<p>What about cost? It stands to reason that it would cost more to ship a 40&#8217; High container, after all. Again, I cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information, as I pulled it from many sources, but I did my best to cross-reference these figures before recording them here.</p>

<table>
<th abbr="Cost comparison of shipping a 20' versus a 40'H container" colspan="2">Container Cost Comparison</th>
<tr>
<td>20'</td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40'H</td>
<td>130%</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Given how seldom I would ship this rig, and the minor surcharge of a 40&#8217;H cube versus a 20&#8216; container, the decision for which container it should fit in should still come down to the importance of that extra space. Do not worry about shipping costs or weight. Instead, prioritize liveability&#160;&#8212;&#160;which to me means an extra 12.25&#8220; of headroom and 2&#8221; of width. You may have different priorities, but if I decide to build an expedition rig at this size, I will do so for a 40&#8217; High cube.</p>

<p>Choosing the 40&#8217; High cube also gave me extra space to ship other gear and accessories outside of my rig, that I could then pack in and on it at my destination. See the table below for the max dimensions of an expedition rig that will fit in this shipping container.</p>

<table>
<th abbr="Max dimensions for an RV in a 40'H cube" colspan="4">Max Rig Dimensions for a 40'H Cube</th>
<tr>
<td>Container</td>
<td>Length</td>
<td>Width</td>
<td>Height</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40'H</td>
<td>39' 6.5"</td>
<td>7' 8"</td>
<td>8' 5.75"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />

<p>As you may have guessed, I went through all of this just to change my mind again. While medium-duty utility vehicles have some serious draws, I want a large enough vehicle that I can live in it for long periods of time. I also want enough fuel for a range of at least 1,000 miles, and something I know can get through anything. Mitsubishi and Isuzu&#8217;s trucks might be able to do those things, but an LMTV will do them better. The M1083 will never ship in a container, slip down a narrow trail, or get un-stuck without a fight&#160;&#8212;&#160;but for my use case, no other chassis will do. I wanted to post these figures today, though, in the hopes that it will save those of you with different priorities some time.</p>

<p>Stop me if you&#8217;ve heard this one before: the Government brought its best intentions and a bottomless bag of money, removed all incentive for fiscal responsibility, then left us all wondering why an entire industry got so expensive. No, I&#8217;m not talking about higher education&#160;&#8212;&#160;or health care, pharmaceuticals, or agriculture; I&#8217;m talking about infrastructure.</p>

<p>Charles Marohn <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/7/31/why-does-infrastructure-cost-so-much">points out</a> that the United States has used infrastructure spending to boost its economy for decades, without considering the long-term costs of those projects. Those bills are now coming due in the form of expensive upkeep. Thanks to an environment that did little to incentivize fiscal responsibility, we find ourselves saddled with these massive maintenance projects and equipped with a cost-insensitive workforce to handle them. He falls short in offering a helpful solution, but his analysis of the root problem is excellent.</p>

<p>Many developers have a tendency to consider themselves smarter than everyone else&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least, smarter than the person who wrote the platform they build on. Web developers have made a habit of this, but as Carter Sande <a href="https://carter.sande.duodecima.technology/javascript-page-navigation/">points out</a>, that just might not be the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s best to build small, simple, standards-based web pages. Browser developers are really good at their jobs, and they&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on features like progressive rendering that help your sites feel fast without any effort on your part. It&#8217;s not worth it to try and go behind their backs&#160;&#8212;&#160;premature optimizations like client-side navigation are hard to build, don&#8217;t work very well, will probably be obsolete in a couple years, and make life worse for a decent portion of your users.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most Soldiers hate organized Physical Readiness Training, or PRT. They tolerate it. Few enjoy it, and even fewer get anything out of it. I have a 1,600 word draft of an article titled &#8220;Army PRT is Garbage&#8221; that explains why&#160;&#8212;&#160;and outlines a few ways we could make it better&#160;&#8212;&#160;that will never see the light of day. Public critiques tend to reflect poorly on those who post them. I expect most Soldiers could speak at length on this subject, though, so ask one sometime. Today, I want to talk about the shift in mindset that helped me come to terms with this program.</p>

<p>Think of organized PRT not as a workout, but rather a team building exercise. No one will ever frame it this way, and you may take some flak for voicing this opinion, but it makes much more sense. Diverse work roles will ensure the entire team almost never gets together during work hours, but much less competes for their time and attention between 0600 and 0700. Use this time to build the team first, and as a workout second. The determining factor in your team&#8217;s health and fitness will never be the difficulty of this 45 minute workout anyway, but rather their actions during the other 23 hours of the day. Use this time together well. The alternative is the much-hated PRT program, and if this doesn&#8217;t work out for your team, you can always go back to it.</p>

<p>Hillel Wayne explains why EMT&#8217;s continue to use error-prone paper Patient Care Reports even though they have digital replacements: the software is too slow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It wasn’t even <em>that</em> slow. Something like a quarter-second lag when you opened a dropdown or clicked a button. ... Did that quarter-second lag kill anyone? Was there someone who wouldn&#8217;t have died if the ePCR was just a little bit faster, fast enough to be usable? And the people who built it: did they ask the same questions? Did they say &#8216;premature optimization is bad&#8217; and not think about performance until it was too late? ... Most of us aren&#8217;t writing critical software. But this isn&#8217;t &#8216;critical software&#8217;, either: nobody will suddenly die if it breaks. You just switch back to paper PCRs. But it could have saved lives. At scale, it could have saved people dying from PCR errors.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This struck a chord with me. I once spent the first three hours of my day signing 10 PDFs on a horrendously underpowered thin client&#160;&#8212;&#160;and it shocked my co-workers when they heard I got through all of them before lunch. None of that work was critical, but the work I had to put off to get it done was. No one thought that through when they bought these machines, though: they saw small numbers in the &#8220;Total&#8221; and &#8220;Recurring&#8221; costs columns, and signed without question. Someone made a similar poor choice for digital Patient Care Reports, and although no one will ever take the time to know the true cost of either miscalculation, make no mistake&#160;&#8212;&#160;in both cases, it is high.</p>

<p>I make a conscious effort to get out of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">my bubble</a> as much as possible, so when I saw a Jalopnik article proclaiming <a href="https://jalopnik.com/vanlife-can-be-cheaper-weirder-and-more-accessible-th-1836822787">Vanlife Can Be Cheaper, Weirder, And More Accessible Than Instagram Would Have You Believe</a>, I bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll give Anna Merlan the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she started with the idea that vanlife could be cheaper, weirder, and more accessible than Instagram might lead you to believe, then set out to prove that by living in a 19-year-old Chrysler Town and Country while she travelled from Los Angeles to New Mexico. She spent a lot of time complaining about heat in the desert in the summer, the inconvenience of not having a shower or toilet in a van she did not add a shower or toilet to, and mediocre meals from mediocre food, though, interspersed with complaints about the vanlife community&#8217;s homogeneity. For the most part, it read as a hit piece. I agree and support her point that this lifestyle does not require an expensive luxury van or expensive accessories, but if she actually set out to show that, her general lack of preparedness set herself up for failure and made sure that she did a poor job of it.</p>

<p>So what should she have done? Without spending a dime, she could have dealt with the heat by staying out of the desert in the middle of summer, lined an old bucket with a trash bag for a makeshift toilet and used an elevated water container for a makeshift shower, and invested some time <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/camp-kitchen-tips.html">planning</a> <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2201216/how-make-kickass-camp-meal">for</a> <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2262421/guide-ultimate-backcountry-thanksgiving">tasty, easy camp meals</a>. Basic camping tricks. She could have had some better, long-term solutions for the price of a few dollars, but her point was that this lifestyle does not require expensive things; she could have actually made it for the price of a bit of effort.</p>

From his article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A rule not ultimately backed by the threat of violence is merely a suggestion. States rely on laws enforced by men ready to do violence against lawbreakers. Every tax, every code and every licensing requirement demands an escalating progression of penalties that, in the end, must result in the forcible seizure of property or imprisonment by armed men prepared to do violence in the event of resistance or non–compliance. ... Without action, words are just words. Without violence, laws are just words. Violence isn’t the only answer, but it is the final answer.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ours is a comfortable reality&#160;&#8212;&#160;but just barely.</p>

<p>Another great piece from a few years ago, this time by Brendan Leonard at Outside Online in 2017: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You want a shortcut, here&#8217;s one: Stop believing that anyone who&#8217;s successful at anything has some secret other than focus, drive, and a shitload of hard work. There&#8217;s your shortcut.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this. Every few weeks, someone stops me in the gym to ask for a shortcut. &#8220;Man, that&#8217;s an insane deadlift. How did you get it that high?&#8221; Others say things that make me want to smack them: &#8220;I could never do that.&#8221; The truth is, you could if you wanted to&#160;&#8212;&#160;and as for how I got it that high, the un-sexy answer is months of long, hard, back-breaking, and grueling work after 5 A.M. wake-ups and ten hour work days. I got here because I put in the work and the effort to achieve my goals&#160;&#8212;&#160;not because I discovered some shortcut that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/all-that-time.html">you</a> didn&#8217;t. </p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">As I said about weightlifting</a>, &#8220;Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Get out there and do the work. Stop looking for a shortcut.</p>

<p>Wes Siler has some advice for those looking to buy an adventure vehicle. I agree with almost everything he says, even if most of it just applies to those who already have one: get good tires, have a tire repair kit and recovery gear, get advanced driver training, pack less, don&#8217;t try to force an inadequate car into the role of a much more capable one, and understand the difference between AWD and 4WD&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the rest, not so much. He also suggests leasing instead of buying (say goodbye to things like bumpers and roof racks, and don&#8217;t get too adventurous), defaulting to a truck (too large and heavy unless you choose a mid-size pickup, at which point you might as well get an SUV like a 4Runner), and avoiding a Tacoma&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of the most capable off-road trucks in North America&#160;&#8212;&#160;at all costs. Take the good from this piece and ignore the bad. I plan to post a guide of my own soon.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-08-03 09:07:32-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-08.html">08</a>/03 09:07:32 EST</time>
<p>I have done a bit of work on First Crack <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">since last month&#8217;s update</a>. It&#8217;s time I shared it with you.  </p>

<h2 class="headers" id="JulyActivity">July Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JulyActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>First, the things I did in July.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="GuidedSetup">Guided Setup<span>&nbsp;<a href="#GuidedSetup">#</a></span></h3>

<p>When <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">I re-released First Crack</a> in June, it forced the user to fill out a settings file before building their website. This felt clunky and raised the barrier to entry for new users, so I added a guided setup in July. Now, rather than making the user fill out a config file, First Crack guides them through the process by asking questions for each field. With this update, it even finds the Python 2 or 3 binary on their system, and modifies the engine to run on either version&#160;&#8212;&#160;all behind the scenes. This adds a little more polish to the engine.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="makefileIntegration">makefile Integration<span>&nbsp;<a href="#makefileIntegration">#</a></span></h3>

<p>As I thought about ways to lower First Crack&#8217;s barrier to entry, I identified two easy areas for improvement: editing the path to the Python executable, and knowing how to run the engine. On my machine, Python 3 lives in <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>. Most machines have the binary in <code>/usr/bin/</code>, though, and so new users must first locate their binary and then edit six files to reflect that path. I did not like this, but given the complexity of the task at hand, it did not seem unrealistic. I also told new users to run <code>blog.py</code>, which assumes they know to use either <code>./blog.py</code> or <code>python blog.py</code>. This also seemed reasonable, but why not make both easier?</p>

<p>I started with a shell script. This could have solved my first problem, by detecting the version of Python on the host machine and then modifying the scripts as needed. It would not have solved the second, though, and I knew I could do better. I settled on a makefile. This allowed me to abstract the back-end by reducing <code>./blog.py</code> to build the site to <code>make</code>. This simple command takes care of finding the Python binary, editing the scripts, handling file permissions, and walking the user through the setup process. I used the makefile to abstract other things, too, like previewing (<code>make preview</code>) and deploying (<code>make deploy</code>) the website. I think this turned out great.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Python2Integration">Python 2 Integration<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Python2Integration">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Moving First Crack to Python 3 took all of a few minutes <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">last month</a>, so this month I decided to re-add support for the millions of devices running Python 2. During the first run, First Crack mow finds Python on the user&#8217;s system and modifies itself to work in either Python 2 or 3, based on what it finds.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImprovedDocumentation">Improved Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImprovedDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>As part of these changes, I also spent some time on <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/Standalone-FirstCrack">the README</a>. As I said <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">last time</a>, I will always have more work to do in this area, and in July, I spent some more time there.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="AugustaPlan">Augusta Plan<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AugustaPlan">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I plan to focus my efforts on these areas in Augusta, 2019. I carried some of these over from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">last month&#8217;s update</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would still like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser. I did not get to this in July, so I pushed it to August.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would still like to release the Markdown parser as its own project. I still have some bugs to work out, though, and I would like to add the ability to parse multi-line strings and entire files at once. Perhaps in August.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I still want to outline the peculiarities of my implementation of the Markdown spec in a formal document. That has yet to happen.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImproveDocumentation">Improve Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImproveDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did some work on the documenation this month, but as always, I could do more. Again, a few of the ways I think I can improve the README in particular: </p>

<ul>
<li>GIFs of the install and run process that show simplicity, ease, and speed.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, I want to highlight this.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build. </li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too. </li>
</ul>

<p>I got a few things done in July. Again, though, I have a lot of work ahead of me. I look forward to it, as always.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-08-02 08:56:14-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-08.html">08</a>/02 08:56:14 EST</time>
<p>Leo Babuta of <a href="https://zenhabits.net/">Zen Habits</a> wrote about <a href="https://zenhabits.net/overthink/">a great way to combat overthinking</a> the other day: just make the best decision you can now, given limited information and time to make it. Many will scoff at this idea, for making important choices in particular, but I disagree: I like his approach a lot, because it has worked well for me for almost everything.</p>

<p>Leo wrote his article with simple decisions in mind. Where to eat dinner, what movie to watch, and the like. For choices like these, with little real downside, this approach makes sense. The difference between the best choice and any one of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; ones is minor, if it exists at all, so just pick one. Spare yourself the agony of indecision. When it comes to more consequential decisions, though, the value of his approach becomes less clear.</p>

<p>Should you jump into college? What about a new house? A career shift? No. Find something lucrative and interesting, then enroll. Pick a good house in an area you like, then buy. Study a few career fields and job markets, then jump. When it comes time to enroll, buy, or jump, though&#160;&#8212;&#160;to make a decision, just make one. Do not waste a semester thinking about it. Do not lose a great home to indecision. Leo&#8217;s approach applies just as well here, to these important decisions. You must still do your due diligence first, but having done so, act&#160;&#8212;&#160;and act now.</p>

<p>To those who continue denying the value of this approach, what do you hope to gain? The greatest challenges, wicked problems<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, by definition have no right answer. Will your indecision lead to a better solution? Introspection, research, and due diligence may, but your inability to choose a path never will. Even if you have to make it with limited information and in a time crunch, just make the best decision you can now. Act.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;&#8220;Wicked problem&#8221; sounds like what someone from New England calls a normal problem, but it actually describes an ill-structured and ill-defined challenge for which no solution exists. Better solutions may exist, but you will never find <em>the</em> right answer&#160;&#8212;&#160;only more right ones. Pages 9 to 12 (location 13 to 16) of <a href="https://adminpubs.tradoc.army.mil/pamphlets/TP525-5-500.pdf">Army Training and Doctrine Command Pamphlet 525-5-500: Commander&#8217;s Appreciation and Campaign Design</a> does a great job of talking about wicked problems in great detail.</p>

<p>I threw together a web scraper the other day for a project at work. Since web scraping is easy, I had extra time, and I needed to poll a few hundred pages from a single domain often, I rotate through a pool of user agent strings and randomize my request pattern to make it less likely that the server will block me. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a> once blocked me after <a href="/projects.html#hnScraper">I did not take precautions like these</a>, so I made sure to avoid that this time around. Pierre over at ScrapingNinja <a href="https://www.scrapingninja.co/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">talked about these and a few other strategies yesterday</a>. Looks like I have a few features to add.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-european-diesel-cars/">a simple question</a>: Why does Europe have ultra efficient diesel vehicles, but America does not? I had heard the claims, that some European diesels get up to 80 miles per gallon&#160;&#8212;&#160;yet those in North America eek 50. I had a hunch, that <a href="https://dougdemuro.kinja.com/here-s-why-we-can-t-buy-that-80-mpg-diesel-we-rented-in-1325972764">stringent EPA rules forced auto makers to sell second-rate vehicles in the United States</a>, but I had to know for sure.  </p>

<p>It should have come as no surprise that this is more complex. First, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a4567/4330313/">The United States&#8217; low fuel prices make the upfront cost of diesel engines a tough pill to swallow. Americans also tend to want more speed than efficient, small diesel engines produce</a>. In short, the market for diesels does not exist here. Gasoline reigns supreme because it checks all the boxes for almost everyone.  </p>

<p>But what about that storied efficiency? I would pay more, and live with a slower vehicle, for 80 MPG. As it turns out, though, <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1091877_why-european-gas-mileage-ratings-are-so-high&#160;&#8212;&#160;and-often-wrong">the European mileage test does an even worse job of faking real-world use than the American one</a>. <a href="https://jalopnik.com/why-do-european-cars-get-better-mpg-than-us-cars-5981938">European ratings also use the five quart Imperial gallon used in the United Kingdom, rather than the four quart liquid gallon used in the United States</a>. Accounting for these differences closes the gulf between these ratings to about 10%.  </p>

<p>So what about that 10%? Thanks to some testing Consumer Reports did after the Volkswagen emissions scandal, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-how-much-fuel-economy-and-performance-drops-whe-1735705959">we can thank the Environmental Protection Agency for this</a>. <a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-real-scandal-is-the-epas-diesel-policy-not-volkswagen/">Meeting the EPA&#8217;s stringent rules does have a price</a>, but we cannot blame it for slashing performance by almost half.</p>

<p>This would appear to absolve the EPA of its role in keeping great diesels out of American hands, but not so fast. We cannot blame it for a major gap that does not exist, but we can blame it for making sure the United States never sees some of the best ultra reliable, high-output diesel engines in Europe, and some of the even better ones elsewhere. Coupled with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#8217;s overbearing safety standards, which ban certain vehicles by name, these groups have ensured Americans will never see Land Rover&#8217;s classic Defender, one of the greatest off-road and utility vehicles of all time&#160;&#8212;&#160;or the storied Toyota Hilux and Land Cruiser, which outclass every platform on this side of the globe.</p>

<p>The EPA does not deserve the flak it gets for kneecapping diesel engines in America, but these two agencies deserve much criticism for this.</p>

<p>Joe Jackson has some good tips for better camp kitchens. I like to keep everything for cooking, eating, and cleaning in one container, packed at all times. I keep a second one empty for dry goods. This makes trip prep a breeze: I just load the first tote in my car, then fill up the second tote and my cooler in the grocery store&#8217;s parking lot on my way out of town. Along with <a href="http://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/furniture/tables/regular-dining-table">two dining tables</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B001QC31G6">two water jugs</a>, and <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">my storage system</a>, this setup makes cooking tough meals easy, and eating them fun.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-07-23 11:46:06-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-07.html">07</a>/23 11:46:06 EST</time>
<p>A little over a year ago, I moved to Fort Gordon for the Cyber Basic Officer Leaders Course. I saw one of my former classmates in the gym this morning, lounging on a bench press near two of his Soldiers. He once said that he did not have hours to spend in the gym every day, and that he had better things to do with his time.</p>

<p>Thirteen months have passed since he said that, so now I have a question for him: what did you do with all that time you saved? Earn some technical certifications? Get a second degree? Start a side hustle? Or did you sleep through it? Did you waste it all watching Netflix?</p>

<p>I spent a lot of my free time <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">in the gym</a>. I started <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">a side hustle</a>. I made <a href="/projects.html">some projects</a>. He made an excuse.</p>

<p>To those of you reading this who have said something similar, I ask the same question: what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>To those of you who did not have the time to workout, what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>To those of you who did not have the time to write, what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>To those of you who did not have the time to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-own-your-platform.html">build a website</a>, what did you do with all that time you saved?</p>

<p>If you can say, &#8220;I did all these things&#8221; and follow that up with some real accomplishments, then great&#160;&#8212;&#160;but if not, I bet you did have time for those things after all. Instead, you made an excuse.</p>

<p>Tom Smith over at DZone, one of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">a handful of websites I read every day</a>, just finished a great three-part series on common cybersecurity shortfalls. He highlights the importance of basic countermeasures, like encryption and patching, all the way up to complex topics like attack vectors.

Gists have proven especially useful, as a quick and easy way to take notes at work.

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-07-12 17:59:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-07.html">07</a>/12 17:59:51 EST</time>
<p>I wanted to get into this <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">when I explained why you should manage your own website</a>, but that got a little long and this topic deserves its own post. I have talked before about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">my setup</a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">my</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">blog</a> <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">engine</a>, First Crack, but today I want to explain how I run my site, so that you can run yours. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20362319#20363104">I agree</a> that most technical people underestimate the difficulty of setting up a website, and so today I will make that easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">Again</a>, let me clarify what &#8220;run your own website&#8221; means. Under my definition, you must have 1) total control over your content, and 2) the ability to make it public or private at any time. This rules out Medium, for example, because the company owns the rights to the content you publish there. It can also rule out hosted engines like Blogger: if you come back to writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">after a four year break</a> to find your host shuttered, you may no longer have the ability to manage that work. Good backups mitigate this risk, though, so you do not have to start from zero. You may <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">write your own blogging engine</a> that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">builds a site</a> you can <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dont-use-amazon-web-services.html">upload to any web server</a>, but you do not have to.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="HowIRunMyWebsite">How I Run My Website<span>&nbsp;<a href="#HowIRunMyWebsite">#</a></span></h2>

<p>In brief, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">because I have covered it before</a>, my setup allows me to write <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/why-i-write-in-plain-text.html">anywhere</a>. I send finished posts to <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">which can run on any machine</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">with Python 3</a>. First Crack then builds a full-featured static website that I can deploy to even the most basic web server. After spending a few arduous weeks with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dont-use-amazon-web-services.html">Amazon Web Services</a>, I now use Google Firebase. </p>

<p>This covers, at a high level, how I run my own website. That&#8217;s not what you came here for, though, so let&#8217;s move on to how you can run your own.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="HowtoRunYourOwnWebsite">How to Run Your Own Website<span>&nbsp;<a href="#HowtoRunYourOwnWebsite">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Running your own website does not have to take a lot of time, effort, expertise, or money. Sure, you can choose between the easy path that screams &#8220;<a href="https://www.wix.com/explore/websites">I just picked a template someone else designed</a>&#8221; and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/free">a hard one that took many painful weeks to build yourself</a>, but why not opt for the middle ground? This guide will take you from zero to having a live, distinct, and professional-looking website in five easy steps. Although a technical background will make some steps a bit easier, I wrote this guide for novices. I have included links to in-depth how-tos, spelled out every field you need to fill in, named every button you must click, and listed all the command you have to run. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Step1">Step 1: Buy a Domain Name<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step1">#</a></span></h3>

<p>For the novices reading this, domain names identify websites. When you want to use Google, you type its domain name, <code>google.com</code>, into your browser. When I want someone to see my site, I tell them to go to <code>zacs.site</code>. These addresses are unique: there is only one <code>google.com</code>, and only one <code>zacs.site</code>. In this step, you will buy the rights to your own unique address that anyone in the world can use to get to your website. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">your public resume and home on the Internet</a>, you will build a brand around this website; as the gateway to your site, take care in choosing a good domain name. This rules out unprofessional ones, and means you should pick one and stick to it. You will jot it down or spell it out for years, so get rid of any ideas for funny wordplay or creative spellings now. Choose something short, unambiguous, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;if possible&#160;&#8212;&#160;catchy or memorable. I recommend something based on your name. </p>

<p>I prefer to buy domain names at <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a>. If you want an odd one like <code>thisismy.site</code> instead of <code>thisismy.com</code>, you could also use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. Both <a href="https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217281467-How-to-Register-a-new-domain">Hover</a> and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/10072/35/how-to-register-a-domain-name">Namecheap</a> have good how-to guides to help you through this process, so check those out. Make sure you get WHOIS protection, which both offer during checkout. This service will keep your name and address private. Other than that, though, take care to avoid any added products or services. No matter what anyone says, you do not need them. Most domains will set you back about $25 per year. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Step2">Step 2: Choose a Host<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step2">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Next, choose a host. For the novices reading this, these companies store your website on a computer&#160;&#8212;&#160;called a &#8220;server&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;that anyone in the world can see. These servers have addresses that look like <code>156.100.101.102</code>, though. Who wants to deal with that? Your domain name can mask that IP address behind the short and catchy domain name you bought earlier. This will make getting to your website easy for anyone in the world, and the host you choose here will keep it online 24/7/365.</p>

<p>Choosing a host sounds scary. It gets even scarier when facing monthly fees and the prospect of spinning up virtual machines on <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dont-use-amazon-web-services.html">Amazon Web Services</a> for a side project with little tangible value, so let me make this step easy for you. Look for a company with a free tier and easy scalability. This will keep your costs low, and on the off chance a post goes viral, the traffic won&#8217;t crash your server. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dont-use-amazon-web-services.html">Amazon S3</a> comes up all the time, but few think of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing/">Google Firebase</a>. For some reason, no one talks about the easiest, cheapest, and most flexible host, and the one I recommend for all new websites. </p>

<p>Firebase&#8217;s free Spark plan has plenty of resources for a simple website. Even better, on the off chance a post goes viral, for pennies a month you can allow those resources to grow to keep your site online. I have yet to find an easier, more powerful host. Setup takes minutes, and even after days where I have had thousands of visitors, I have yet to pay a single bill. To create a free Firebase account, follow <strong>only</strong> step one in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#create-project">this guide</a>. Do not move on to step two. You can also follow the short guide below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">https://console.firebase.google.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Create a project&#8221;.</li>
<li>In the &#8220;Project Name&#8221; field, enter a name. Choose anything you want, or just use &#8220;public-website&#8221;. Don&#8217;t worry about changing the &#8220;Project ID&#8221; field.</li>
<li>Check all three checkboxes, then click &#8220;Create project&#8221;.</li>
<li>Firebase will take a few seconds to build everything. Click &#8220;Continue&#8221; once it finishes.</li>
</ol>

<p>You now have a Google server set aside for your website, and a domain name to make it easy for people to get there. We will finish setting that up later, though, so move on to step three now.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Step3">Step 3: Choose a Blog Engine<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step3">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Blog engines build websites. Some have all sorts of fancy features, which come at the cost of speed and complexity. Others do a little less, but churn out lightweight sites and do not need a bunch of third-party tools just to function. I prefer the latter, and so I wrote <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>. Given a thousand articles, my engine will build a full-featured, lightweight, static site in less than two seconds. I recommend First Crack, but you can choose anything you want. To follow along with this guide, though, your engine will need to give you a folder full of HTML files.</p>

<p>To get started with First Crack, open a shell window. On a Mac, open Spotlight with the shortcut &#8984;+SPACE, type in <code>terminal.app</code>, hit return, then follow the steps below. You can also skip to the end for a single command that will take care of everything at once. On Windows, use a git client. </p>

<ol>
<li>Copy this snippet, paste it into your shell, and hit return: <code>git clone https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack-Public.git ~/FirstCrack</code>. This will download First Crack into your home folder, in a folder called <code>FirstCrack</code>.</li>
<li>Open the <code>FirstCrack</code> folder with this command: <code>cd ~/FirstCrack</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>ls</code> to see all the files in the folder. </li>
</ol>

<p>Download First Crack and open the folder in one command by copying and pasting this into your shell, and hitting return: <code>git clone https://zjszewczyk@bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/firstcrack-public.git ~/FirstCrack; cd ~/FirstCrack</code>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Step4">Step 4: Build Your Site<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step4">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I will assume you chose First Crack for the rest of this guide. If you did, follow the steps below to build your new site; if not, build it with your engine, then move on to step five.</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup First Crack by running the <em>makefile</em>. Just type <code>make</code> in your shell, and hit return.</li>
<li>First Crack will display some helpful information about the commands you can run with the makefile, then tell you that the configuration file does not exist. It will then ask if you want to set it up. Answer <code>y</code> and hit return.</li>
<li>First Crack will not build your website unless you answer each question. If one does not apply to you, enter <code>None</code>. </li>
<li>Once finished, First Crack will build your new website. Check it out with <code>make preview</code>, which will open the local copy in your default browser. </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="headers" id="Step5">Step 5: Publish Your Site<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Step5">#</a></span></h3>

<p>You now have a Google server, a domain name, and a website on your home computer. You must get that site to that server, though, and so we will focus on that next. The Firebase how-to does a nice job of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">walking you through this process</a>, but so do I.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the Node.js website</a> and get <code>npm</code>, the Node Package Manager. Download the version recommended for most users, then double-click the <code>.pkg</code> file to install it.</li>
<li>Go back to the shell window from before, and enter this command: <code>npm install -g firebase-tools</code>. Wait until the Firebase install finishes.</li>
<li>Enter <code>firebase login</code>. Sign in to the Google account you used to create a Firebase project in step two.</li>
<li>Enter <code>firebase init</code>. Scroll down to &#8220;Hosting&#8221;, using the down arrow. Press the space bar to select this line, then hit return.</li>
<li>Scroll down to select the project name from step two, then hit enter.</li>
<li>When Firebase asks for a public directory, type in <code>./local</code> and hit return. Do not use <code>./local/</code> or any other folder, unless you chose a blog engine other than First Crack.</li>
<li>Answer &#8220;n&#8221; to &#8220;Configure as a single-page app&#8221;. You want a full website. </li>
<li>First Crack comes with a <code>404.html</code> page, so answer &#8220;n&#8221; when it asks to overwrite the existing one. Answer &#8220;n&#8221; when it asks you to overwrite <code>index.html</code>, too.</li>
<li>To make your new site live, use <code>make deploy</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Firebase will upload <code>local</code> to your server, then display two URLs. Use the first, &#8220;Project Console&#8221;, to manage your site. The second, &#8220;Hosting URL&#8221;, replaces that ugly IP address we talked about earlier. You can use this to get to your server, like <code>156.100.101.102</code> earlier, but since <code>public-site-12345.firebaseapp.com</code> does little to improve on <code>156.100.101.102</code>, let&#8217;s change that next.</p>

<ol>
<li>To make your domain name redirect to your new site, open the &#8220;Project Console&#8221; URL. Login if necessary.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Connect domain&#8221;, and enter the name you bought in step one. If, for example, you bought <code>zacs.site</code>, you would enter <code>zacs.site</code> in the first box.</li>
<li>Leave the redirect checkbox unchecked, then click &#8220;Continue&#8221;.</li>
<li>To verify that you own the domain name, you will need to add a TXT record. Google has helpful guides for <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6151044?hl=en">Hover</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6142985?hl=en">Namecheap</a>, so check those out. In general, though, find the advanced settings in your registrar, click the button to create a new entry, choose &#8220;TXT&#8221; for the type, and paste in the values Firebase provides.</li>
<li>Go back to the Firebase console and click &#8220;Verify&#8221;.</li>
<li>Once Firebase verifies that you own the domain name, go through similar steps to add &#8220;A&#8221; records. These &#8220;A&#8221; records will let anyone in the world type in your domain name and get redirected to the Hosting URL from before.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Finish&#8221;. It may take a few hours for your domain to start redirecting to your version of <code>public-site-12345.firebaseapp.com</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You now have a public website on your own custom domain. Anyone in the world can see this now, so let&#8217;s make it your own.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="YourNextSteps">Your Next Steps<span>&nbsp;<a href="#YourNextSteps">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Out of the box, First Crack gives you a working website. It has a home page, a blog, a place for projects, and a disclaimer with a copyright notice and some verbiage saying you speak for yourself alone. Make this site your own by editing the home page, writing about your projects, and posting your first article. I will walk you through this, but you should check out <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack-Public">First Crack&#8217;s README</a>, too.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="EditingtheHomeandProjectsPages">Editing the Home and Projects Pages<span>&nbsp;<a href="#EditingtheHomeandProjectsPages">#</a></span></h3>

<p>First Crack updates the blog and archives pages, and the RSS feed, every time you post something new, For the content of the home and projects pages, though, it looks to the HTML files in the <code>system</code> folder. Start by editing these. </p>

<p>In a text editor like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, open <code>index.html</code>. Replace everything below <code>&lt;!&#160;&#8212;&#160; DIVIDER &#160;&#8212;&#160;&gt;</code> with a picture of yourself and a short bio. Remember, as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">your public resume and home on the Internet</a>, you want this page to give potential employers and new acquaintances a polished first impression. <a href="/">I talk about myself, some of the things I wrote, and how readers can get in touch</a>. Save the file, then move on to the projects page.</p>

<p>On this page, talk about all the projects you have ever worked on. They all deserve a shout out here, no matter how small. I got my first job in the Army because of some work I did on a Hacker News scraper, even though that project never amounted to anything. You never know what might catch someone&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>I like to break up academic work, writing, and programming. Leave the stock table and headers in there for this layout, or toss them all out for your own. Save the file, then move on to posting your first article.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PostingYourFirstArticle">Posting Your First Article<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PostingYourFirstArticle">#</a></span></h3>

<p>The <code>Content</code> folder has examples of the two types of blog posts First Crack supports. Use original articles for long-form original content, and linkposts to add in your two cents as you point your readers to something someone else wrote. This piece is an example of the former. Look to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tbt-writing-vs-writing.html">my recent link</a> to Shawn Blanc&#8217;s excellent article <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/"><em>Writing vs writing</em></a> for an example of the latter.</p>

<p>For your first post, I recommend a short intro. Talk about yourself and your goals. Picture someone reading this because they want to know more about you, why you decided to start a website, and what they can expect from you in the future. Use this to set the tone for your entire website. Do a good job. Once you finish, save the file in the <code>Content</code> folder. Get rid of the two example posts, then rebuild your site with <code>make</code>. Preview your work with <code>make preview</code>. Edit as necessary, then make it all public with <code>make deploy</code>. Your new site will go live a few seconds later.</p>

<br />

<p>You now have a distinct and professional-looking website, open to the world, on your own custom domain. Aside from $2/month for the domain name, this will cost you nothing until you hit it big&#160;&#8212;&#160;so get to writing, already. It&#8217;s about time we heard from you.</p>

<p>Although a few weeks old now, I still think addressing this may have some enduring value.</p>

<p>Regulus Cyber got some attention a few weeks back for tricking a Tesla Model 3 into making a premature turn. Not an unsafe one, just premature. I almost didn&#8217;t read the post, though, let alone write about it, because <em>of course</em> you can trick a Tesla into turning early. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20235151">The</a> article&#8217;s <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/la10ax/tesla_model_3_spoofed_off_highway">popularity</a> made me come around, though, and so here we are. Evidently this is still 1) surprising, and 2) interesting, and I would like to address both of those here.  </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s tackle #1 first. This does not surprise me because at best, autonomous systems will drive as well as you do on an unfamiliar country road at night. Consider that scenario: you can see no more than a few feet ahead, know nothing about the road beyond your headlights, and have nothing but a questionable GPS route to guide you through the darkness. At any moment something could jump into your path, or you could find your way blocked by something no map will ever identify. These conditions are the human equivalent of the conditions under which the autonomous Tesla system operates at all times. Given that, <em>of course</em> Regulus Cyber tricked it into turning early.</p>

<p>Put yourself in that scenario. If you found yourself on an unfamiliar country road in the middle of the night, able to see maybe twenty feet ahead of you and navigating with a GPS that said to turn in a mile, would you turn early, onto another <em>road</em>, if that GPS told you to? I would. And that&#8217;s why this is neither surprising nor interesting to me, and why it should be neither to you as well. Of course you can trick a Tesla into turning early, because you could trick me into doing it, too. Instead of focusing on the weird edge cases where this miraculous technology fails(?) by doing the same thing a human would, how about we focus on all the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/5-times-elon-musk-and-teslas-autopilot-saved-their-drivers-bacon">lives</a> it saved <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/02/05/tesla-owner-autopilot-saves-life-swerving/">driving</a> <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/tesla-autopilot-saved-lives-of-family-says-driver">better</a> than we do?</p>

<p>On the topic of misunderstood technology, I have another point to make about the ridiculous notion of &#8220;planned obsolescence&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I will leave that for another day.</p>

<p>Steph Smith, on what it takes to become great. Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what greatness truly means. <em>I&#8217;ve come to learn that it&#8217;s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</em>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot agree more. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">As I said before about weightlifting</a>, &#8220;Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible. Before worrying about anything else, worry about doing that; that is the single most effective way to reach your goals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not try to explain away others&#8217; successes, or try to excuse your own failures, by calling them anything other than the results of long, hard work&#160;&#8212;&#160;or a lack thereof. Anything else would be a lie, to yourself and anyone else to which you justify your actions.</p>

<p>This post&#8217;s title comes from <a href="https://youtu.be/PurwB5H3F0o">Ray Lewis</a>. I love that line, and I encourage you to take it to heart. I did many years ago, and it has served me well.</p>

I look forward to explaining it soon in <em>Starting Over: The Gear I Would Buy if I Had to Do it All Over Again</em>, but in brief: you can either buy a nice thing once, or a cheap thing forever. Price does not necessairily indicate quality, but you will never find quality without paying for it.</p>

<p>I took over a team in June, and like Dwight, I have more than one priority. We have our mission and all the tasks it entails, but on my own time, I decided to also encourage my Solders to take an active role in their personal development. This involved a long write-up, a detailed plan, and a list of many books, articles, and projects to guide their study. Those will make their way here in time, but for now, I want to highlight some of the gems I re-discovered as part of this process&#160;&#8212;&#160;starting with <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/"><em>Writing vs writing</em></a>, by Shawn Blanc.  </p>

<p>I used to read everything <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a> wrote, and this piece from 2011 reminded me why. Writing is hard, and the people who don&#8217;t think so either haven&#8217;t written enough, or haven&#8217;t written well enough, to understand this.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/own-your-platform.html">Run Your Own Website</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-07-05 09:24:09-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-07.html">07</a>/05 09:24:09 EST</time>
<p>I go back and forth on running my own website. I love <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">working</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">on</a> <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>, but that work can become trying. I have little time for <a href="/projects.html">projects</a>, and the more I spend coding, the less I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">read</a> and write. On net, though, I consider this <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2019/01/10/yes-you-should-blog/">a worthy pursuit</a>, and so I do not plan to move away from my setup any time soon. Many feel the same, and over the last few months in particular, I have seen a lot <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2019/03/08/taking-control-of-your-internet/">more people</a> express this on <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/html/">websites of their own</a>. I would like to add my voice to theirs today.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this a few months ago, after reading a since-deleted article on Medium. Its author had a few reasons for leaving the platform, a lack of control over his work primary amongst them. His piece reminded of the reasons I went this route a long time ago, and the reasons I stick with it today. I have touched on them a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/why-i-write-in-plain-text.html">couple</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">times</a> before, but today I want to spend an entire article on the subject.</p>

<p>First, let me clarify what &#8220;run your own website&#8221; means. Under my definition, you must have 1) total control over your content, and 2) the ability to make it public or private at any time. This excludes Medium, for example, because the company owns all the content you publish there. It can also exclude hosted engines like Blogger: if you come back to writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">after a four year break</a> to find your host shuttered, you may no longer have the ability to manage that work. Good backups can mitigate this risk, though, so you do not have to start from zero. Of course, you may go to the other extreme and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">write your own blogging engine</a> that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">builds a site</a> you can <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dont-use-amazon-web-services.html">upload to any web server</a>, but you do not have to.</p>

<p>No matter how you go about it, you should run your own website. You should have total control over your content and the ability to make it public or private at any time, for these reasons in particular:</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="YourWebsiteasaResume">Your Website as a Resume<span>&nbsp;<a href="#YourWebsiteasaResume">#</a></span></h3>

<p>At a high level, I think of my website as a resume. Anyone who wants to know more about me, or wants to see <a href="/projects.html">examples of my work</a>, can come <a href="/">here</a>. Use your website to give potential employers and new acquaintances a polished first impression. You can also use it to streamline information sharing: when CADD came up with my boss, I wrote down <a href="/projects.html">the URL to my projects page</a>. He can check it out, or not, and neither of us has to deal with the awkward hassle of emailing models or pictures back and forth.</p>

<p>I could just have a public Facebook profile, and post all my projects on Medium. The idea of telling my boss to &#8220;Just look me up on Facebook&#8221;, though, or of seeing a company bundle my hard work into a package for profit, does not appeal to me.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="YourWebsiteasaRecord">Your Website as a Record<span>&nbsp;<a href="#YourWebsiteasaRecord">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I also like to think of my website as a record. When I read something interesting, I write about it&#160;&#8212;&#160;some times in great detail, other times with a simple note about the part that made it worth reading. Some posts just have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/git-home.html">handy snippets that I can pull out to use on other machines</a>. I may also write about complex subjects to clarify, condense, and record my thoughts on a topic, or to teach me something new. I can then refer back to these documents, and point others to them as well.</p>

<p>This has proven more useful than I thought possible. In particular, a record of my thoughts on complex topics has come in handy. When those subjects come up, rather than re-hash a messy thought process, I can use these well-structured, well-reasoned, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;perhaps most important&#160;&#8212;&#160;well-researched documents to guide the conversation.</p>

<p>When I started writing this, I planned to have more reasons for running your own website. In broad strokes, though, this about covers it: run your own website to make a great first impression, and to streamline information sharing. Whether talking to a new boss or trying to show off one a cool project, this will make your life much easier. You will find a whole host of other, <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2019/01/10/yes-you-should-blog/">less tangible benefits</a> in this hobby, but I will leave them for you to discover on your own.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0619.html">First Crack Release Notes, June 2019</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-06-30 06:36:10-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-06.html">06</a>/30 06:36:10 EST</time>
<p>Since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">re-releasing First Crack</a>, I have made some great progress on the project. Not enough for version 2.0, though, so I spent the last few days thinking about how I wanted to post new versions. In short, I decided not to.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">Traditional software versioning</a> implies a cycle of feature integration&#160;&#8212;&#160;feedback&#160;&#8212;&#160;improvement that I neither have the user base nor the inclination to do. I also don&#8217;t want to take such a formal approach to a hobby I work on in my spare time. I still want to talk about improvements, so instead of versions, I plan to post monthly release notes for First Crack. This series will serve as a written record of the changes I make and the thought process behind them, as well as a good way for those interested in the project to keep up with it.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="JuneActivity">June Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JuneActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>First, the changes I made in June. These are now live at <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack-Public">Github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/firstcrack-public/src/master/">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublicRelease">Public Release<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublicRelease">#</a></span></h3>

<p>It took me a long time to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">re-releases First Crack</a>, but I finally did it. This new version does more, builds a more feature-rich website, and implements a larger subset of the Markdown spec. It now has the versatility and polish a public project should, unlike <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">its predecessor</a>. This release was long overdue, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;I think&#160;&#8212;&#160;worth the wait.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Python3Migration">Python 3 Migration<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Python3Migration">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I started writing First Crack in 2012, with Python 2; I ported it to Python 3 in June. This involved swapping a few <code>print</code> statements with the new <code>print()</code> functions.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="CannedPrettyPrint">Canned "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#CannedPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I believe in generating valid HTML files that also look good: the former because I care about being a good programmer, and the latter because it makes debugging easier. First Crack still builds valid HTML files, but I canned &#8220;pretty print&#8221;. It created too many problems with <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> blocks that I could not solve with the old Markdown parser. I plan to revisit this once I work out the kinks in the new one.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="StatefulMarkdownParser">Stateful Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#StatefulMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Ahead of First Crack&#8217;s re-release, I identified the Markdown parser as the oldest, hackiest part of the code base. As the least optimized, most called method in the project, re-writing it seemed like a great idea. This had the potential to have a huge positive impact, and so I set out with a few goals in mind. I wanted to build a more reliable parser, less susceptible to weird edge cases, that implemented more of the Markdown spec. This would mean more overhead, so I also wanted the method to stay fast. I set out to do this over the next few months, but ended up finishing it a couple days later. The new version met each of my goals, and runs about 25% faster than its predecessor. I plan to release it as its own project soon.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImprovedDocumentation">Improved Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImprovedDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I made the last change in June to First Crack&#8217;s documentation. In particular, I spent some time fleshing out <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/Standalone-FirstCrack">the README</a>, with the goal of doing a better job explaining the aspects that make my project great. I settled on four short bullet points on First Crack&#8217;s front- and back-end features. I now highlight the project&#8217;s strengths right at the start: a lightweight, full-featured, beautiful blog with a custom landing page, and a fast, easy to use, platform-agnostic engine to build it.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="JulyPlan">July Plan<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JulyPlan">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I plan to focus my efforts on these areas in July, 2019.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>See above, but in brief: now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser, I would like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature I canned before the re-write. I like reading well-formatted HTML.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Speaking of the new Markdown parser, I would also like to release it as its own project in July. Usage would look like this:</p>

<pre>
$ python3
>>> import Markdown
>>> md = Markdown()
>>>
>>> raw_markdown = "Hi, **this** is a sentence with a [link](https://google.com) to *Google*."
>>>
>>> print(md.html(raw_markdown))
Hi, <strong>this</strong> is a sentence with a <a href="https://google.com">link</a> to <em>Google</em>.
</pre>

<p>Before I can do that, though, I have a few bugs to work out with the Markdown implementation, and I would like to enable parsing multi-line strings and entire files at once. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>There are some peculiarities to my implementation of the Markdown spec, so I want to outline those differences in a formal document. I picture something similar to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text">the original Markdown syntax document on Daringfireball</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="GuidedSetup">Guided Setup<span>&nbsp;<a href="#GuidedSetup">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would also like to add a guided setup to my project. Right now, First Crack forces the user to fill out a config file before it builds their website. I would like to make this a guided process, where First Crack asks the user questions and builds that config file itself. At this stage, I want to focus on lowering the barrier to entry for a new user, and making First Crack more attractive. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="BetterDocumentation">Better Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#BetterDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did a lot to improve First Crack&#8217;s documentation in June, but I will always have more work in this area. That will look like more robust comments in the scripts, but I want to focus on the README. As the first document most people will read about the project, I want to make it compelling, informative, and fun. I have a few broad ideas going into this, based on good examples from other projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIFs of the install and run process that show simplicity, ease, and speed.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, </li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build. </li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too. </li>
</ul>

<p>I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I look forward to it.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-06-22 16:48:17-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-06.html">06</a>/22 16:48:17 EST</time>
<p>I read <a href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html">a rundown of a cyber security threat hunting model</a> the other day. Right at the start, the author&#8217;s definition of &#8220;hunting&#8221; jumped out at me. It jumped out at me because he defined it well&#160;&#8212;&#160;which reminded me of all the times I have seen others fail at this&#160;&#8212;&#160;and prompted this post.</p>

<p>From his article: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Before we can talk about hunting maturity, though, we need to discuss what, exactly, we mean when we say &#8216;hunting&#8217;.  I usually define hunting as the collective name for any manual or machine-assisted techniques used to detect security incidents.  I refer to it as a &#8216;collective name&#8217; since there are many different techniques hunters might use to find the bad guys, and no single one of them is always &#8216;right&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this. David gives us <em>his</em> definition of the term, keeps it concise, then explains it further to create a shared understanding between him and his reader. Those outside of the cyber security field will find value here in <a href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html#!/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html">a well-written piece on a technical topic</a>, and those within it ought to check it out for its relevance to their job. I wanted to highlight David&#8217;s piece today for those reasons, and as a way in to talking about some writing turn-offs.</p>

<p>Writing turn-offs do two things. First, they make me want to stop reading. They tend to indicate an inability to communicate well, which does not bode well for the rest of the piece. They also make the author seem less credible. They tend to stem from inexperience, a weak grasp on the topic, or a lack of creativity. In a world where I can find another expert in seconds, I will. For the most part, though, they just rub me the wrong way. Teachers love to talk about what &#8220;good&#8221; writing looks like, without ever showing their students what bad writing looks like; today I want to do just that.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheDictionaryDefinition">The Dictionary Definition<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheDictionaryDefinition">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Lazy writers like to start with something like, &#8220;The dictionary defines &#8216;hunting&#8217; as, &#8216;the act of one that hunts&#8217;.&#8221; I despise this. If I wanted a canned definition, I would go to Webster. Using one shows me that you have done nothing to make your work worth my time. It also shows me that you do not know the topic well enough to explain it. I came to you because I wanted to learn about the nuances of a complex topic, from the perspective of an expert. This tells me I won&#8217;t, and that you aren&#8217;t. Almost every time I see this, I close the page and find an answer somewhere else.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="EmoticonsEmojisIrregularPunctionandExclamationPoints">Emoticons, Emojis, Irregular Punction, and Exclamation Points<span>&nbsp;<a href="#EmoticonsEmojisIrregularPunctionandExclamationPoints">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I like writing that evokes emotion; I do not like it forced upon me. Writers should apply &#8220;Show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; to more than just fiction. Emoticons, emojis, exclamation points, and the like try to take the place of well-crafted prose. They do not do this well. Write well, and the work you craft will reflect the emotion you felt while forming it. I like Elmore Leonard&#8217;s rule for exclamation points, and his advice for writing in general: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3016163/elmore-leonards-10-simple-rules-for-writing">"You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.</a> Great stuff.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Hyperbole">Hyperbole<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Hyperbole">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I get it&#160;&#8212;&#160;you need to get people to click on your post, so you said that a lady who wore a T-rex costume to her sister&#8217;s wedding &#8220;is the best person in America.&#8221; Is she, though? The best person in this country of 327,200,000 people&#160;&#8212;&#160;better than the other 327,199,999&#160;&#8212;&#160;took time out of her busy day, as the best person in the country, to wear a weird costume to her sister&#8217;s wedding? No.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Listicles">Listicles<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Listicles">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Again, I get that you need to draw people in, but you will never draw me in with 10 ways to do anything. These types of titles signify poor writing and worthless content. I like to say that Homer did not call the <em>Odyssey</em> &#8220;24 Books that Will Surprise You&#8221;.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="SensationalHeadlines">Sensational Headlines<span>&nbsp;<a href="#SensationalHeadlines">#</a></span></h3>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t believe X&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;the only thing I don&#8217;t believe is that you, garbage content mill, have anything worthwhile to tell me.</p>

<br />

<p>I try to keep an open mind, but writers who do these things rub me the wrong way. Don&#8217;t give your readers a reason to find their answer elsewhere, because I will.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-06-10 11:50:12-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-06.html">06</a>/10 11:50:12 EST</time>
<p>I like Antonio&#8217;s idea, a lot. As much as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I try to keep my system stock</a>, this will make transferring the scripts and aliases I have accumulated to new machines super easy. A few of my favorite aliases:</p>

<pre>
$ alias gs="git status"
$ alias gac="git add . && git commit -m"
$ alias gp="git push"
</pre>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I have talked about these aliases before</a>; they make interacting with Git just a little bit easier. <a href="https://bitsofco.de/git-aliases-for-lazy-developers/">Hat-tip to Ire Aderinokun for the idea</a>.</p>

<pre class='shell'>
alias gits="find ./ -name '.git' 2> /dev/null | grep -v '.Trash'"
</pre>

<p>This neat snippet searches the current directory, and all sub directories, for Git repos. I have a lot of coding projects <a href="/projects.html">in the works</a>, and this helps me keep track of them.</p>

<pre class='shell'>
alias r="source ~/.bash_profile"
</pre>

<p>This lets me refresh my bash profile whenever I make a change&#160;&#8212;&#160;for example, adding a new alias or script. Simple, and handy.</p>

<pre class='shell'>
alias search="grep -rnw './' -e "
</pre>

<p>This alias gives me search functionality in the terminal, so I can avoid opening up Finder for most simple queries.</p>

<pre class='shell'>
alias tree="find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g'"
</pre>

<p>This neat little command displays the current directory contents, and all its sub-directories, as a tree. I used this to create the tree in <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">the First Crack readme file</a>. <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/09/view-folder-tree-terminal-mac-os-tree-equivalent/">Hat-tip to OS X Daily for this one</a>.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-06-05 19:52:05-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-06.html">06</a>/05 19:52:05 EST</time>
<p>I go back to work next week after a month-long vacation. I bought a house, traveled, read often, and wrote a little. Then I spent a lot of time thinking about those things. In particular, I spent a lot of time thinking about the choices that made me a homeowner at twenty-four, that also put me on a week-long beach vacation. I started writing again to help condense, clarify, and record trains of thought like these, so today I want to start with my thoughts on life and choices.</p>

<p>I like to think of life as a series of hallways. They have many doors at first, but fewer the further you go. Some doors open with little effort and lead to worthless corridors; behind the toughest lie the greatest opportunities. Many peoples&#8217; hallways connect&#160;&#8212;&#160;some for a moment, and others for a lifetime.</p>

<p>We all start in different places&#160;&#8212;&#160;or hallways&#160;&#8212;&#160;faced with different options&#160;&#8212;&#160;or doors. We have lots of options at first, but each choice leads to a hallway with fewer doors. This does not rule out major changes later in life, although it does mean those chances come around less often and at ever-increasing costs. We also all choose between the easy route and working for the hard one, and realize rewards&#160;&#8212;&#160;or suffer losses&#160;&#8212;&#160;based on that choice. I like that this analogy acknowledges that people will come and go, too. Some will stay for a moment, others for a lifetime, and each of them has a chance to influence us. Surround yourself with successful people, to pull you toward the successful hallways on your good days and carry you there on your bad. My analogy also implies two things: our lives are the product of our decisions, and if you find yourself in a bad hallway, it may take a lot of time, effort, expertise, and skill, but you can build a new door that leads to a path of your own making.</p>

<p>// A college degree does not mean you cannot pursue a trade, but student loan debt might make taking that path impossible, no matter how much you like the work. Coming from the other side, you might wake up after a decade in a trade and want to change careers, but the life you built in that capacity may not permit it: from familial obligations to bill collectors, any number of things might make that path impossible.</p>

<p>// I started working for a painter during high school. I worked for a great boss, with good people, doing a skilled job that made me good money and took up 40 hours a week. I walked into work, picked up a paint brush, and worked all day; nine hours later I walked out of work and did not think of it again until the next day. That was the easy route. Instead I chose to go to college for four years and join the Army, but I have been rewarded for the difficulty of my path. I work longer hours now but make twice as much and own a house at 24.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-06-04 20:05:02-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-06.html">06</a>/04 20:05:02 EST</time>
<p>When I started blogging, I bounced around between places like Zoomshare, FreeWebs, and WordPres. Nothing fit, though, and so in 2011 I built my own content management system. I started running my website on <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> a few months later. Easy, fast, and portable, my engine has no dependencies, builds a static website of over one thousand pages in less than two seconds, and works just as well as a server daemon as it does on my home machine. I stopped posting public updates to the code base in 2015, but kept working on the project in private. Today I re-release First Crack to the world.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/firstcrack-public/">the repository</a> for installation, setup, and usage instructions. In brief, though, just download the files and run <code>blog.py</code>. First Crack will take care of the rest. Here, I want to talk about the steps I took to build an easy, fast, and portable blogging engine.</p>

<p>Above all else, I wanted to build First Crack with stock Python. Developers abandon projects all the time, and I did not want to put a critical feature in someone else&#8217;s hands. Relying on one or more third-party functions would have made setting up First Crack harder, too. I also could not count on others to prioritize speed. Take, for example, checking file extensions. <code>filename.endswith(&#8216;.txt&#8217;)</code> takes about three times as long as <code>&#8216;txt&#8217; == filename[-3:]</code>, and four times as long as <code>&#8216;.txt&#8217; in filename</code>. This change alone sped my engine up by almost 25%. This approach did have some downsides, though. It meant a ton of work at first, and then even more debugging and working out edge cases. In exchange, I had full control of every aspect of the project. I could optimize every little detail for peak performance, and avoid wasting time creating runtime environments on new systems. That seemed worth it then, and I stand by that choice now.</p>

<p>I also wanted to make First Crack easy to use, which meant hiding a lot of work behind the scenes. I wrote, re-wrote, and wrote again functions for parsing Markdown, working with files, and building valid HTML documents and RSS feeds. This gave me an engine that not only ran anywhere and ran fast, but also one that turned simple Markdown files into a feature-rich, metadata-heavy blog, without any input from the user. The user can get into the weeds if they want to, but they don&#8217;t have to. I worked hard to make that possible with First Crack. Just give it a flat directory of plain text content files, and it will do the rest.</p>

<p>After almost a decade, content management systems have gotten much better since I started this project. Today, I have no doubt I could make something like Squarespace or WordPress work for me. I have yet to find anything First Crack cannot do, though, or an engine that wins out in ease of use, speed, and versatility. I like working on First Crack, and I look forward to adding cool new features in the future. <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">I hope you will give it a try</a>, and I hope you will let me know what you think.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-05-30 15:14:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-05.html">05</a>/30 15:14:49 EST</time>
<p>Patrick Wilbur has written a great two-part series on the dangers of public WiFi networks, over at HackerNoon. In <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-hacker-intercepted-your-wifi-traffic-stole-your-contacts-passwords-financial-data-heres-how-4fc0df9ff152">part one</a>, he shows just how little work it takes to steal personal information from unsuspecting users at a cafe. His <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-are-we-still-sending-so-much-web-traffic-unencrypted-over-the-internet-383317b758ec">second article</a> explains some of the reasons that took so little work, as well as a few ways to fix them. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-complete-endless-ridiculous-list-of-everything-you-need-to-be-safe-on-public-wi-fi-57fca0a733f7">Part three</a> outlines concrete steps the average internet user can take to make themselves less susceptible to these types of attacks. Whether you read all three to understand your vulnerability, or just skip to the end to fix them, everyone should take something away from this series. I also recommend <em><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/basic-computer-security.html">Basic Computer Security</a></em>, for the novice and expert alike.</p>

<p>The Internet ranks among the greatest inventions of all time. It gives everyone instant access to mankind&#8217;s collective wisdom, learned through millions of years of evolution. It connects people across cultures, continents, and time zones. It ushered in an era of unprecedented economic growth. History already recognizes the Internet&#8217;s remarkable impact, in the few short decades it has existed so far, and its significance will continue to grow as mankind uses it to achieve even greater things down the road.</p>

<p>Despite its immense value, today the Internet kind of sucks. The part of the Internet that most people use, <a href="https://techlog360.com/darknet-vs-dark-web-vs-deep-web-vs-surface-web/">a small subset</a> <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/dark-web-reality/">of the entire network</a>, has become filled with ads, trackers, viruses, spyware, and all sorts of bad actors looking to exploit naive users. Mankind managed to turn one of its greatest inventions into a hacker&#8217;s playground, set in a cesspool of invasive monetization strategies. Lucky for us, a few simple steps can do a lot to help mitigate these problems. These tips will do little more than that, though, and I want to make that clear. I wrote this to help mitigate the dangers of ads, trackers, viruses, spyware, and some low-level hackers, not with the intent to make your computer uncrackable. If a smart enough person targets a specific machine, they will get in.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheEasyFix">The Easy Fix: Installing Software<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheEasyFix">#</a></span></h3>

<h4 class="headers" id="BrowserExtensions">Browser Extensions<span>&nbsp;<a href="#BrowserExtensions">#</a></span></h4>

<p>A few key programs can stop most web-based ads, trackers, and the types of resources that load viruses and spyware. Many people work hard to exploit naive users, but many others also work hard to keep those bad actors from doing so; the latter create software like <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a>. Adblock Plus hides ads, which will also make websites load faster. Ghostery stops creepy sites from tracking you around the Internet. uBlock Origin can target anything; on the off chance that the other two miss something, I use it to block individual resources. Although they overlap in some areas, I like using them all because each does a different thing well. Installing all three takes just a few clicks, and even with their default settings, they make browsing the web much better; for even better results, spend some time learning how to fine-tune them.</p>

<p>Another extension you ought to have, <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, makes it harder for bad actors to steal your information on public WiFi networks. It works like this: when you visit <code>https://www.google.com</code>, your traffic to Google gets encrypted so that no one but Google sees it. Websites that use <code>http://</code> do not use encryption. Bad actors can watch your traffic to websites that do not the <code>https://</code> prefix. HTTPS Everywhere works to trick every website you visit into using encryption wherever possible, which help keeps your information private.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="AntivirusSoftware">Antivirus Software<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AntivirusSoftware">#</a></span></h4>

<p>After browser extensions, antivirus software does a great job as a second layer of defense. Windows comes with basic antivirus software by default, but those looking to beef up their security should check out some great free programs, too. <a href="https://www.avast.com">Avast</a>, for all platforms, scores high in all reviews. Although an easy attack vector, hackers do not have to go through the web browser to access your machine or your network; they may target one&#160;&#8212;&#160;or both&#160;&#8212;&#160;in ways that extensions like Adblock Plus, Ghostery, and uBlock Origin cannot stop. Should someone get into your machine or your network, Avast and similar tools will help detect and remove them. Installing these, too, takes just a few clicks.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheToughFix">The Tough Fix: Altering System Behavior<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheToughFix">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Browser extensions can make it harder for hackers to find easy ways into a target. Antivirus software adds a second layer of security for machines and the network. Good programs such as Avast use passive measures like virus scans, and active measures like blocking suspicious behavior. This basis will serve the average user well. I want to stress that it does not make them immune to all attacks, though, just the most basic ways bad actors steal personal data, infect computers, and trash the web browsing experience. Again, if a smart person targets a specific computer, they will get in. Those looking for better results can take some more advanced steps, though, so I talk about those below. Fair warning, I use a Unix shell and Windows Command Prompt often. It made much more sense to give you short commands than guide you through a complex maze of menus.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="AutomaticUpdates">Automatic Updates<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AutomaticUpdates">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Automatic updates take too long, force reboots, and seem to happen at the worst times; turning this feature off, though, makes a hacker&#8217;s job just a little bit easier. Most system updates patch bugs and vulnerabilities a hacker could use as a way into your machine. Do the right thing, turn them on, and let them install often. Do the same for programs from trusted vendors as well. This takes discipline, but it will make you less susceptible to the types of attacks found on public sites like <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">Exploit Database</a>. Exploit Database lists hundreds of ways hackers can use old versions of software and operating systems to get into a machine. Stay updated and give yourself less to worry about.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Thehostsfile">The hosts file<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Thehostsfile">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Another simple way to make web browsing just a little bit better involves editing your <code>host</code> file. In simple terms, every time your computer tries to connect to <code>www.google.com</code>, it checks a system file to see whether you have visited the website before. If you have, it loads information about <code>www.google.com</code> from your computer and then serves the site; if not, it looks for that information on the Internet, downloads it, and then serves the site.</p>

<p>Now imagine that instead of you trying to open Google, a website tried to make a sneaky connection to www.TrackMyUsers.com. Your computer first checks the <code>hosts</code> file for information about that site, then the Internet, and then loads the page. You can use the <code>hosts</code> file to fool that sleazy site, though, by giving it the wrong information about www.TrackMyUsers.com. As a result, the sleazy website does not get to track you. Privacy preserved.</p>

<p>Bad actors use many websites for their sleazy purposes, but many people have gone to great pains to catalog all those pages as well. Several people publish lists with tens of thousands of websites like www.TrackMyUsers.com, with the sole purpose of helping users block them. I found Dan Pollock&#8217;s collection first at <a href="https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/">SomeoneWhoCares.org</a>. After some research, I learned that <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">Steven Black</a> combines fourteen lists and posts <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts">the result</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>If you want to download Steven&#8217;s code, run the scripts, and set your system up on your own, go for it. On a Mac, though, you can just open Terminal, copy and paste the snippet below, hit Enter, and input your password. The snippet backs up your <code>hosts</code> file to <code>hosts.bak</code>, downloads Steven&#8217;s list, and tells your computer to read this new <code>hosts</code> file from then on.</p>

<pre>
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak; sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts -o /etc/hosts; dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
</pre>

<p>On Windows, open Notepad, open or create the file at <code>C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code>, copy and paste everything on <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts">this page</a> into Notepad, and save it. Next, click the Start button, type <code>cmd</code>, right-click Command Prompt and choose &#8220;Run as Administrator&#8221;, then run the command below to tell your computer to read this new hosts file from now on.</p>

<pre>
ipconfig /flushdns
</pre>

<p>Any time a website tries to connect to a known bad domain, it will fail. This alone will remove a lot of ads, trackers, and even some known sources of viruses and spyware. Although Adblock Plus, Ghostery, and uBlock Origin also do this, blocking those websites at the system level with your <code>hosts</code> file means those extensions won&#8217;t have to work as hard. Because they do less, your browser does less, which can improve browsing speeds. A win all around.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="VirtualPrivateNetworks">Virtual Private Networks<span>&nbsp;<a href="#VirtualPrivateNetworks">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I also suggest using a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. Although many websites have gotten much better about encrypting their traffic, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-hacker-intercepted-your-wifi-traffic-stole-your-contacts-passwords-financial-data-heres-how-4fc0df9ff152">bad actors can still manage to steal private information from anyone on a public WiFi network</a>. VPNs connect you to a safe server, encrypt your data so no one can snoop on you, and then send your traffic out from that safe server to the world. Although this adds a few extra steps to the process, and will set you back a few dollars per month, it makes stealing your private information and tracking you much harder. Most VPNs also block ads, meaning you will see even less of them.</p>

<p>Choose <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2019/04/19/Your-VPN-is-a-serious-choice.html">a reputable company</a> <a href="https://schub.io/blog/2019/04/08/very-precarious-narrative.html">and you cannot go wrong</a>. <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> stands out as one of the best, though, so check it out. NordVPN has clients for the major operating systems, browsers, and phones, so it can protect you everywhere. Follow its simple setup guide and even novice users will have a working VPN setup in no time.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheRouter">The Router<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheRouter">#</a></span></h4>

<p>With browser extensions, antivirus software, and a VPN on your machine, hackers will have a much harder time gaining access to your system. Each one of these blocks several avenues of attack, but not every one. Again, if a smart person targets a specific computer, they will get in. Another great way to make that much harder, though, involves locking down your router.</p>

<p>Most people use the cable company&#8217;s router. It sits on a shelf, and when the Internet stops working, they unplug it, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in. Problem solved. Few understand how these devices work, though, and so most people gloss over them when beefing up their security. Do not make the same mistake.</p>

<p>All traffic from the home network out to the internet, and from the internet into any device on the home network, goes through the router. Anyone trying to hack into one of your computers has to go through this device. This makes the router your first line of defense against the outside world. Lucky for us, locking it down does not take a lot of work.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="LocatingtheRouter">Locating the Router<span>&nbsp;<a href="#LocatingtheRouter">#</a></span></h5>

<p>You must login to your router to change its settings. If you have never done this before, you need to find it on your network. On a Mac, use <code>netstat</code>. The <code>grep</code>, <code>head</code>, and <code>awk</code> commands after it strip out the things you do not need for this step.</p>

<pre>
netstat -nr | grep default | head -1 | awk -F " " '{print "Router IP: ",$2}'
</pre>

<p>On a Windows machine, use <code>ipconfig</code>. <code>findstr</code> pulls out the line with the IP address for the default gateway.</p>

<pre>
ipconfig /all | findstr "Default Gateway"
</pre>

<p>Once you have the router&#8217;s IP address, copy and paste it into your browser. A login window will open. If you have seen this page before, enter your credentials; if not, try the defaults for your cable company. Using &#8220;admin&#8221; as your username and &#8220;admin&#8221;, &#8220;password&#8221;, or leaving the password field blank works most times. You could also try searching for the defaults for your router. Once you have logged in, move on to the next step.</p>

<p>From here on out, the route you take to change each setting will vary between devices. I will explain what you should change and why, and leave it up to you to get it done.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="LoginCredentials">Login Credentials<span>&nbsp;<a href="#LoginCredentials">#</a></span></h5>

<p>First, change your login credentials. Anyone who can find the IP address of your router, a public-facing device, can access it just as you did; once there, a bad actor could do all sorts of things to steal your personal information, attack the machines on your home network, and watch every single thing you do on the Internet. Choose a good password, save your changes, and move on.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="FirmwareUpdates">Firmware Updates<span>&nbsp;<a href="#FirmwareUpdates">#</a></span></h5>

<p>Next, update your router&#8217;s firmware. If you can turn on automatic updates, do it. Again, most system updates patch bugs and vulnerabilities a hacker could use as a way into your machine, so turning them on will make you less susceptible to the types of attacks found on public sites like <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">Exploit Database</a>, <a href="https://blog.osvdb.org">OSVDB</a>, and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org">Mitre</a>. At the least, update your firmware now and plan on doing this often.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="DisableWPS">Disable WPS<span>&nbsp;<a href="#DisableWPS">#</a></span></h5>

<p>If your router has it, turn off WiFi Protected Setup. Although a nice idea, in practice WPS allows bad actors to bypass the router. By guessing a short PIN number, they gain access to the network without having to enter the much longer WiFi password. Leave this feature on and you risk someone sidestepping your first line of defense.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="UseWPA2">Use WPA2<span>&nbsp;<a href="#UseWPA2">#</a></span></h5>

<p>Routers can use a few kinds of encryption. WEP takes almost no time to crack; avoid it at all costs. WPA does a better job, but you should also avoid it. Some routers support WPA2 and AES encryption, so choose that if you can; if not, vanilla WPA2 will keep your data safe.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="UseaFirewall">Use a Firewall<span>&nbsp;<a href="#UseaFirewall">#</a></span></h5>

<p>Some routers ship with their firewall turned off by default. Make sure yours has it on, and set it to the strictest level you can without making your network useless. Most people can handle a medium-level filter without any problems, but the stricter you go, the better; in turn, bad actors will have fewer ways to exploit your network.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="ScheduleUptime">Schedule Uptime<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ScheduleUptime">#</a></span></h5>

<p>Not all routers support this, but if yours does, set it to turn your network off during certain times of the day. Hackers tend to target businesses at night, with no one around, and home networks at night or during normal business hours, when most people work. This helps them stay unnoticed. They might also choose these times to move lots of data, because you would not notice a drop in speed. Deny them the chance by shutting down whenever you can.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="EnableMACAddressFiltering">Enable MAC Address Filtering<span>&nbsp;<a href="#EnableMACAddressFiltering">#</a></span></h5>

<p>Every Internet-connected device has a unique identifier burned into its hardware, called a MAC address. It looks like this: <code>aa:b1:2c:d3:e4:5f</code>. Turn on MAC address filtering to allow certain devices onto your network, and deny all others.</p>

<p>On a Unix machine, use the first snippet to find your MAC address; on a Windows computer, use the second. Once found, enter the MAC address on your router, make sure you will <strong>allow</strong> this machine rather than <strong>deny</strong> it, and save the change.</p>

<pre>
ifconfig | grep ether | head -1 | awk -F " " '{print "MAC address: ",$2}'
</pre>

<pre>
ipconfig /all | findstr "Physical"
</pre>

<p>Repeat this process for each device you wish to allow on your network. Although not a 100% guarantee that a bad actor cannot get onto your network, they will at least have one more barrier in their way.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheHardFix">The Hard Fix: Changing Your Behavior<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheHardFix">#</a></span></h3>

<p>You have locked down your browser, operating system, and network. These steps have made getting into your machine much harder, snooping on you almost impossible, and even gotten rid of those pesky ads and invasive trackers as an added bonus. Thanks to your efforts, though, the most promising attack vector has now become you. Humans almost always make for the best targets, and now that you have locked down most other avenues of approach, the hacker&#8217;s best chance of success lies in targeting you.</p>

<p>Avoiding social engineering and phishing attacks, the type that target people to gain access to a system, comes down to three things: awareness, skepticism, and conduct. Learn how to spot ads in search results and sham websites trying to pass themselves off as legitimate ones. Distrust by default email attachments and anything that asks for personal information. Avoid installing anything you do not need, even if it comes from a trusted source: it would not take a lot of work for a smart hacker to hijack the Microsoft Office installer, for example, mid-download, and replace it with a version that infects your machine with a virus of some sort. This type of man in the middle attack happens all the time.</p>

<p>You may have had a tough time with some of the technical tasks here, but changing your behavior will take the most work. There exists a gulf in difficulty between a complicated task like locking down a router, and a hard one like learning situational awareness, training skepticism, and altering your conduct. Work at it, though, and you will deny bad actors one of the most successful attack vectors of all. Along with the technical changes I outlined in the earlier sections, these changes make you a much harder target.</p>

<p>I am immediately skeptical of any framework for getting something done. Individuals often use these elaborate processes to procrastinate, and in organizations they have a tendency to become bloated risk avoidance mechanisms. I see the former danger in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">David Maciver&#8217;s strategy for doing hard things</a>, but it did remind me of my own, so I want to take a minute to share my approach here.</p>

<p>In short, just do the hard thing. When you don&#8217;t feel like working out, <a href="https://youtu.be/N3t-em026ec">go</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/1023918579522002944">anyway</a>. When you don&#8217;t feel like writing, write anyway. The more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19958340">something scares you</a>, the more important it is that you get aggressive, charge into it, and crush that thing until it holds no power over you. You might need a twelve step process to conquer that hard thing, but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">just like in weightlifting</a>, give hard work a try first.</p>

<p>I have talked about arguments <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">for and against Huawei</a> before, as well as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk.html">the challenge of judging risk</a> in this space.

<p>I fancy myself a technical guy. I got into web development at a young age, learned to write Python, Perl, C, and a handful of other languages in high school, and got a degree in Computer Science in college. Although I work in an organization not known for its technical prowess, it has worked hard to change that: today, Army Cyber matches industry on the defensive side, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;by law&#160;&#8212;&#160;has far more experience on the offense. I bring all this <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">back up</a> so that you have some context when I say this: don&#8217;t use Amazon Web Services to host your static website; it&#8217;s far too complex. I spent twenty days struggling to work through that process. Today I will share my cautionary tale.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AmazonWebServices">Amazon Web Services: The Internet's Backbone<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AmazonWebServices">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Around 2003, Amazon began using back-end infrastructure designed, created, and maintained in-house. The team that build that back-end grew along with the company. Three years later, it became a public-facing service. Amazon Web Services has since grown to become the strongest player in this space.</p>

<p>Most people know Amazon as the has-anything online store that delivers in two days or less. Developers also know it as the 800-pound gorilla in the web services room. Although <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-essential-is-AWS-to-the-internet">just a small part of the Internet runs on Amazon Web Services</a>, or AWS, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/28/17622792/plugin-use-the-internet-without-the-amazon-cloud">it captures almost 40% of the sector&#8217;s revenue</a>. From this we may deduce that the platform hosts most of the popular revenue-producing sites in use today. From <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/when-amazon-web-services-goes-down-so-does-a-lot-of-the-web.html">Airbnb to Slack and Adobe Connect to Netflix</a>, many people go entire days without leaving AWS infrastructure.</p>

<p>The market loves AWS, and the handful of civilian developers I know do, too. To help keep that love alive, Amazon attracts new people to its platform with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">a free tier</a>. This allows those with small projects to use the company&#8217;s cloud resources at no cost, as long as they stay within some broad limits. Many people host static websites for free on Simple Storage Service, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>. Amazon <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">even</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-1/">supports</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/">that</a>. Due to the ever-increasing popularity of the platform, the good things I had heard about it, and its great price tag, I decided to use AWS to bring this site back online.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AmazonS3">Amazon S3: A Fairytale Beginning<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AmazonS3">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">opened an AWS account</a> on March 29th, 2019. <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> relied on a Node.js front-end at the time, so I spent an hour porting it to a static site builder. I then dove into <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html">setting up the server</a>. That process, although not hard, did prove tricky. I started by creating three Buckets: one for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html#step1-create-bucket-config-as-website">static hosting</a> of <code>zacs.site</code>, the second to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html#root-domain-walkthrough-s3-tasks">send requests</a> for <code>www.zacs.site</code> to <code>zacs.site</code>, and the third for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html">server-side logging</a>. I then made the first two public with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html#step2-add-bucket-policy-make-content-public">a baffling block of JSON</a>, and pointed my domain to the AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoints.html">Website Endpoint</a>. Around five hours after I opened my account, I could visit <code>http://zacs.site</code>. I called it a win and went to bed around 2:00 AM on March 30th.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AmazonCertificateManager">Amazon Certificate Manager: Seeds of Disillusionment<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AmazonCertificateManager">#</a></span></h3>

<p>On the morning of March 30th, I felt good. All had gone well so far. I had just two small items left on my to-do list. First, I wanted to set up HTTPS for better <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-https-not-secure-label/">security</a> and <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">search engine ranking</a>. I also wanted to fix my service worker, which would help with caching, make my site work offline, and round out a perfect score in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a>. Since using <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features">HTTP kept my service worker from loading</a>, tackling the first would solve both problems. After last night&#8217;s success, I dove right in.</p>

<p>On the AWS support site, I found <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/">a helpful post on setting up HTTPS with Amazon CloudFront</a>. I did not yet have an SSL certificate, but found a link there to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/">a page</a> that sent me to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html">a third post that explained the process for getting one</a>. I had to request a free SSL certificate through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">Amazon Certificate Manager</a>, or ACM. Given these can cost as little as $5 or over $500 per year, I had no problem with this.</p>

<p>I started the request, but found that I could not finish it. An error message told me new accounts had to contact support to raise the default request limit, which <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_acm">should have started at 1,000</a>. Through a note tucked into <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html">yet another support page</a>, I later learned that &#8220;new AWS accounts might start with a lower limit&#8221;. In practice, they start with 0. I sent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/manage-service-limits/">a ticket</a> in on the morning of March 30th, and got the cap raised to 1,000&#160;&#8212;&#160;the supposed default&#160;&#8212;&#160;three days later on Tuesday, April 2nd.</p>

<p>Once I could request an SSL certificate, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html">the process</a> took a few seconds. Then came the next hurdle: proving I owned my domain. I tried using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html">DNS records</a> first, then exposed my <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html">email</a> address to the public WHOIS database when that failed. Neither worked. Over the next ten days, and almost as many support emails, a well-meaning support rep tried to get me through this opaque process. On April 12th, while waiting for a reply, I changed a setting on some menu that caused AWS to issue the certificate. I do not believe AWS wants its users to earn these through trial and error, but well done if they did.</p>

<p>I did not know how long this process would take, or how involved it would get when I started. Given the ease with which I set up my site, I did not expect it to take ten days of support emails, web searches, and trial and error. That surprised me. For all I knew, though, everyone went through this drawn-out and complex process. I had my doubts, but I pressed on.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AmazonCloudFront">Amazon CloudFront: A Fairytale Unraveled<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AmazonCloudFront">#</a></span></h3>

<p>On April 12th, with an SSL certificate &#8220;in-hand&#8221;, I went back to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/">the post on setting up HTTPS with CloudFront</a>. Since the Distribution limit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront">defaults to 200</a>, I should not have had a problem creating my first. Once again, though, in practice it starts at 0. While I waited for that limit increase, I learned some things about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html">AWS Regions</a>.</p>

<p>All websites live on actual devices called servers. The greater the distance between them and their users, the slower those websites become. Someone in New York could access a server down the street <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/support/what-is-latency">0.14 seconds</a> faster than one in the United Kingdom, for example. These delays matter when sending a lot of people a lot of data. Content delivery networks, or CDNs, solve this problem by cloning content all around the world. Traffic from Japan might go to devices near Asia, and traffic from the western United States might go to California. Users can still access data in other parts of the world, but keeping copies on nearby servers yields much lower response times.</p>

<p>Amazon takes this approach to its web services with Regions. Rather than run S3 out of a single area and use a CDN to spread that data worldwide, Amazon has data centers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">across the globe</a>. Each runs <a href="https://blog.rackspace.com/aws-101-regions-availability-zones">an instance</a> of the AWS stack. As I waited for my CloudFront limit increase, I learned that CloudFront lived in Virginia. To my dismay, I also learned that it would not work with certificates from other regions. The SSL certificate I had labored over for ten days came from ACM in Ohio.</p>

<p>With no other choice, I started back at square one. I had raised my certificate limit in the Ohio region, but not Virginia, so I sent a new ticket in on April 12th. Four days later, on April 16th, the AWS support staff complied. By then they had also raised my CloudFront Distribution cap. Eighteen days after I opened my AWS account, I had the resources to use HTTPS. The process of setting it up proved both hard and complex. Trial and error got me through once again, and then the weird edge cases started popping up.</p>

<p>First, my blog would not update. I could alter any other file in my S3 bucket, or upload a new one, and see that change a few minutes later. This delay made sense, because CDNs need time to propagate these changes. <code>blog.html</code> failing to update did not. It turns out CDNs can hold onto old versions of the files they serve, though, so I ended up taking <code>blog.html</code> off the network. This fixed my first edge case, but then the real problems started.</p>

<p>When I refreshed the page, it showed me a long string of special characters. I had seen this before, when my browser tried to read a compressed file as plain text. Some digging lead to <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=381831">an AWS forum post from 2012</a>, from a user with the same problem. It looked like some server-side logic made either CloudFront or S3 serve the compressed <code>blog.html</code> without the flag that told my browser to decompress it. I confirmed this with a few shell commands:</p>

<pre class='shell'>
curl https://zacs.site/blog.html
# "curl URL" sends a GET request to the server at URL. It then prints the server's response to the shell. When I ran the command above, it showed me a long string of question marks. I had a hunch that gzip compression caused this.
</pre>

<pre class='shell'>
curl https://zacs.site/blog.html | gunzip
# This time, "curl" sent that response to "gunzip" before printing it to the shell. "gunzip" decompresses files compressed with gzip. When I ran the command above, it printed raw HTML. This told me the server replied with the compressed "blog.html" file. By default, though, "curl" requests uncompressed files.
</pre>

<p>If I got a compressed file without asking for it, what would I get if I asked for a compressed file? This command let me find out:</p>

<pre class='shell'>
curl https://zacs.site/blog.html -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip"
# This sent a GET request to my server, and told it to respond with compressed gzip files. Because "curl" does not unzip compressed files, this command should have printed a bunch of question marks to my shell. I got raw HTML.
</pre>

<p>Let me say this all again. When asked for a compressed file, my server replied with a plain text, unzipped one. When asked for a plain text, unzipped file, it replied with a compressed one.</p>

<p>I checked my S3 bucket first. The <code>blog.html</code> file there had gzip compression, and tags that told AWS that. Somewhere between the S3 bucket and my device, then, CloudFront toggled the compression without toggling that flag. I confirmed this by storing a plain text, unzipped <code>blog.html</code> on the server and running those three commands again.</p>

<p>I tried all sorts of hacks to fix this. Adding <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code> to every header. Taking <code>blog.html</code> off CloudFront&#8217;s CDN. Re-uploading zipped and unzipped versions of the file. Nothing worked. As part of that process, I turned the CDN off and on a few times. After the third half-hour cycle, the problem vanished. Not happy to take my win and call it a day, though, I started poking around the rest of my site. Did this problem affect any other pages? Every page I tested worked except one: <a href="/assets/MTV.html">my LMTV RV builder</a>. I threw in the towel.</p>

<p>Closing in on two thousand words, I will leave my answer for a later post. Go into this with eyes wide open and you may fare better, but I have my doubts. Having a staff on-hand&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a budget for premium support&#160;&#8212;&#160;might make AWS a great choice. For a small shop looking for an easy way to host a static site, though, find something else.</p>

<p>I try to keep my machine as close to stock as possible. This makes setup a breeze, helps it stay fast, and means I have less to check when something goes wrong. Although <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I have gotten away from that</a>, I have plans to re-work my setup soon. I appreciate posts like <a href="https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/10503/5-tasks-you-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-vim">this one</a>, from August Garcia at 256 Kilobytes, that remind me of these powerful built-in tools, and that I may not need a bunch of flashy third-party apps after all.</p>

<p>I follow a lot of websites. In <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html"><em>Keeping Up with Current Events</em></a>, I list the sixteen I use to start my day. These get regular updates and help me keep up on current events. I also follow a lot of websites run by independent writers and small shops. These cover many of the same topics, but due to their size, they do not get updated as often. The unique perspective they bring to the table, though, makes for some of the most interesting reading I do. To round out <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">my earlier post</a>, I want to share this list with you today.</p>

<p>Out of the fifty-two sites on this list, I can expect to see new content on less than a quarter per day, a handful of others in a week, and the rest on an inconsistent basis. Rather than check each one, I keep up with them using their RSS feeds. In brief, think of an RSS feed as a single file containing a list of all the articles on a website. On April 9th, 2019, for example, the feed for my blog would have looked like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>2019/04/09 14:26:08: Secure, Private File Sharing (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/secure-private-file-sharing.html">https://zacs.site/blog/secure-private-file-sharing.html</a>)</li>
<li>2019/04/09 14:13:33: Before, Now, and in the Future (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html</a>)</li>
<li>2019/04/08 12:05:49: The Last Four Years (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html</a>)</li>
<li>2019/04/06 11:12:52: Simple, not Easy (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html">https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever a new post goes live, that list gets updated. After posting <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html"><em>Proxy Innovation</em></a> on April 10th, my feed would have changed. Take note of the new entry at the top:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2019/04/10 12:28:18: Proxy Innovation (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html</a>)</strong></li>
<li>2019/04/09 14:26:08: Secure, Private File Sharing (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/secure-private-file-sharing.html">https://zacs.site/blog/secure-private-file-sharing.html</a>)</li>
<li>2019/04/09 14:13:33: Before, Now, and in the Future (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html</a>)</li>
<li>2019/04/08 12:05:49: The Last Four Years (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html</a>)</li>
<li>2019/04/06 11:12:52: Simple, not Easy (<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html">https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>RSS readers watch RSS feeds for changes like that. On April 10th, my reader would have shown me a new article called <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html"><em>Proxy Innovation</em></a>. My app of choice, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, keeps track of feeds for over forty sites. Any time one of those lists changes, when a new post goes live, Reeder delivers it to my phone. Just like <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">my morning reads</a>, most of the time this yields a handful of articles, one or two of which find their way here, and the rest of which I read for my own edification. Although drawing from many sources, their inconsistent posting schedule means I skim around 100 titles per day. I break these sites up by genre below, in no particular order, along with a brief note on each.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Adventuring">Adventuring<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Adventuring">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Recall that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">I defined</a> &#8220;adventuring&#8221; as &#8220;the vehicles you use to get the gear you pack to the places you want to go.&#8221; To break this section up, I divided the sites here into those three categories.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Thevehiclesyouuse">The vehicles you use...<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Thevehiclesyouuse">#</a></span></h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://twoifoverland.com/">http://twoifoverland.com/</a> - Bethany and Martin Burzynski had <a href="https://www.globalxvehicles.com/">Global Expedition Vehicles</a> build their RV atop an M1083 chassis in 2016. Their site <a href="/projects.html#fmtv">inspired me</a> to <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">start building my own</a> rig, and informed a lot of the decisions I made as I started that process.</li>
<li><a href="https://blissordie.com">https://blissordie.com</a> - Lilly and Darrel Davis have lived in an RV based on the M1078 chassis since April of 2018. I found their website soon after Two If Overland. <a href="https://blissordie.com">Bliss Or Die</a> has a lot of great information for anyone thinking of getting into this space.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.overlandpeanut.com/blog/">https://www.overlandpeanut.com/blog/</a> - Around the same time I found Bliss Or Die, I found <a href="https://www.overlandpeanut.com/blog/">Overland Peanut</a>, too. Christina Aalto and Brian Marsh also bought their M1078 in 2018, and write about the conversion process on their site and on Instagram.</li>
<li><a href="https://liveworkwander.com">https://liveworkwander.com</a> - Stepping out of the world of large-scale expedition rigs, Jessica and Jorge adventure in a 70 series LandCruiser. Their journey to this rig made for a great story, and now that they have it, they continue to do all sorts of cool things and post great articles at <a href="https://liveworkwander.com">Live Work Wander</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://expeditionportal.com/">https://expeditionportal.com/</a> - The staff behind <a href="https://expeditionportal.com">Expedition Portal</a> churn out some of the best overlanding content on the Internet. If it involves vehicular travel, they cover it&#160;&#8212;&#160;and they cover it well. If you want to get serious about overlanding, start here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.drivingline.com/">http://www.drivingline.com/</a> - I have a problem with most car magazines: they focus on sports cars and racing, neither of which internet me. <a href="http://www.drivingline.com/">DrivingLine</a> does a good job of balancing that coverage out with industry news and off-road vehicles and gear. This helps me keep up with current events in the auto industry, and checks the box for adventure-related topics, too.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="togetthegearyoupack">...to get the gear you pack...<span>&nbsp;<a href="#togetthegearyoupack">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I like gear. I like reading about it, trying cool new things, and finding the best tools for the job. This has cost me a lot of money in the past, so I stick to reading now. These sites help me do that. Some have a narrow focus&#160;&#8212;&#160;on ultralight backpacking on the Appalachian Trail, for example; others focus on a much broader swath of the industry. These are the best sites for gear news on the internet.</p>

<p>I look to these first four sites for general interest gear news. Show me the coolest, newest toys on the market&#160;&#8212;&#160;everything from cars to pocket knives to yachts. Although their coverage overlaps some, they feature enough different content to warrant watching all four. I will never buy most of the things I see here, but I enjoy reading about them.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gearpatrol.com">https://gearpatrol.com</a> - Gear Patrol</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gearhungry.com">https://www.gearhungry.com</a> - Gear Hungry</li>
<li><a href="https://gearjunkie.com">https://gearjunkie.com</a> - GearJunkie</li>
<li><a href="https://uncrate.com/">https://uncrate.com/</a> - Uncrate</li>
</ul>

<p>These next sites focus on things like backpacks and knives&#160;&#8212;&#160;items an individual would use for a day trip, for example. I have put a lot of money into this type of gear in the past, so I like to keep up on the latest trends and inventions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.everydaycommentary.com/">http://www.everydaycommentary.com/</a> - I like Anthony Sculimbrene and Nick Shabazz&#8217;s podcast <a href="http://www.geargeekslive.com/">Gear Geeks Live</a> for the same reason I read Anthony&#8217;s site, <a href="http://www.everydaycommentary.com/">Everyday Commentary</a>: their passion for phenomenal gear reminds me not to settle for the mediocre.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.carryology.com">https://www.carryology.com</a> - I like backpacks, I own a lot of them, and <a href="https://www.carryology.com">Carryology</a> helps me keep up with the best the industry has to offer.</li>
<li><a href="https://packconfig.com">https://packconfig.com</a> - The folks over at <a href="https://packconfig.com">Pack Config</a> bring an interesting mix of gear reviews, recommendations, and in-depth testing to the table, alongside curated &#8220;pocket dumps&#8221; that showcase the cool gear their readers carry. These posts in particular have lead to some interesting finds for me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.exploringoverland.com/overland-tech-travel/">http://www.exploringoverland.com/</a> - Exploring Overland&#8217;s <a href="http://www.exploringoverland.com/overland-tech-travel/">Overland Tech &#38; Travel</a> blog focuses more on the types of gear overlanders use. Look here for a mix of gear an individual would use on a day trip, and things like portable fridges.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.itstactical.com">https://www.itstactical.com</a> - I have mixed feelings on <a href="https://www.itstactical.com">ITS Tactical</a>. The blog came about as a way to promote the store, so I understand why it highlights giveaways and serial posts with little lasting value. That sort of content drives pageviews, which turn into revenue. That comes at the cost of burying valuable content, though. I have found some phenomenal information on this site. <a href="https://www.itstactical.com/series/overland-communications/">The recent two-part series on overland communications</a> comes to mind, where Derek Gill explained the challenges of staying in touch in extreme environments and how he overcame them. If you feel up to sifting through a lot of junk to get to some real gems, I cannot recommend the site enough. See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2SqzpY5c-eGScFMuqAitA">ITS Tactical on YouTube</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yompnotes.com/">https://www.yompnotes.com/</a> - This site seldom sees new posts, but Neil Stevens writes good reviews and does some great work customizing his loadouts. I have great affinity for the DIY gear maker.</li>
<li><a href="https://sticksblog.com">https://sticksblog.com</a> - If I ever do hike the Appalachian Trail, I will hike it with the gear recommended on <a href="https://sticksblog.com">Stick&#8217;s Blog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="totheplacesyouwanttogo">...to the places you want to go.<span>&nbsp;<a href="#totheplacesyouwanttogo">#</a></span></h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://misadventuresmag.com/category/read/">https://misadventuresmag.com/category/read/</a> - The writers at <a href="https://misadventuresmag.com/category/read/">Misadventures Magazine</a> post some good gear reviews, but even better, they talk about going places and the less tangible side of adventuring. The all-female staff focuses on gear for women, and brings a different perspective to this space that I enjoy.</li>
<li><a href="https://huckberry.com/journal">https://huckberry.com/journal</a> - Andy Forch and Richard Greiner said it best, so I will let their words do the talking: They created <a href="https://huckberry.com/">Huckberry</a> in 2010 for <a href="https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/the-huckberry-story">guys who lived in the city but <em>lived</em> for the outdoors</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;to give guys gear for today, and inspiration for tomorrow. They manage the former with <a href="https://huckberry.com/">an awesome, curated store</a>, and the latter with <a href="https://huckberry.com/journal">the Huckberry Journal</a>. I got lucky enough to stumble across this site a few years ago, and have followed it ever since.</li>
<li><a href="https://cabinporn.com/">https://cabinporn.com/</a> - I remember the night I discovered <a href="https://cabinporn.com/">Cabin Porn</a>. I spent hours on the site. Although post volume has gone down in recent years, the same great content that sucked me in so many years ago still appears thrtrtoday. I love a good cabin in the woods.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/">https://www.outsideonline.com/</a> - By far the biggest site on this list, <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/">Outside Online</a> posts a lot of new content each day. I still subscribe to the RSS feed, though, instead of lumping it in with my morning reads, because I don&#8217;t want to miss a thing. Outside Online covers everything from repairing a broken zipper in the wilderness to packing for an overland adventure. I do not enjoy the political side of the site, but everyone seems to love that third rail these days.</li>
<li><a href="http://dereklow.co/">http://dereklow.co/</a> - I found <a href="https://dereklow.co/">Derek Low&#8217;s site</a> by way of his viral [*Across the USA by Train for Just $186</li>
<p>*](https://dereklow.co/across-the-usa-by-train-for-just-213/) piece, and stuck around for all the interesting travel writing he does. I plan to take a few of these routes myself.</p>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="YouTubeChannels">YouTube Channels<span>&nbsp;<a href="#YouTubeChannels">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I also follow a few YouTube channels in the adventure space. I choose to do this through RSS as well, so that I never miss a new video. I subscribe to other channels, those that I care less about, on YouTube.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiyiTqpss-ihtLHz-juFxIQ">Expedition Overland on YouTube</a> - The folks that got me into overlanding in the first place, I cannot say enough good things about <a href="https://www.xoverland.com/">Expedition Overland</a>. They inspired me to get a 4Runner and start my grand adventure a few years ago, and they do the same even today. If you have any interest in overlanding, check this channel out.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFf8PTHJTZwtMWLfFkAkS4w">Mountain State Overland on YouTube</a> - <a href="http://www.mountainstateoverland.com/">Mountain State Overland</a> also played an important role in getting me into adventuring. They post a lot of great videos, too, and go on some awesome adventures on the East Coast. I hope to cover a lot of the same routes someday.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbT5ssxEDZHNyz28N4Ov7Wg">nutnfancy on YouTube</a> - If you know of Nutnfancy, you know of him for his gun reviews; if not, go there for the thought-provoking talks on philosophy of use that should come before every piece of gear you own. I like both, but I think he brings the most value to the table when he forces me to think.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH9D1Alq8n7Dd3mM99O9G9A">The Tactical Defender on YouTube</a> - To his credit, Tim also does some nice gear reviews: he takes everything out, puts it through its paces in the woods, and gives his viewers an honest assessment. That said, I just enjoy hearing him talk. I watch the occasional gear review, but for the most part, I stick around for the rambling videos he records while hiking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoBFcQPFNNhUzjsJFPDm2gw">Triple Aught Design on YouTube</a> - Triple Aught Design gets many things right, but even more pretty close. I have yet to go on an adventure without the phenomenal <a href="https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/force-10-ac-cargo-pant/">Force 10 AC Cargo Pant</a>, for example, but the also awesome <a href="https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/triton-ac-short/">Triton AC Short</a> has fit me like spandex since I started deadlifting over 500 pounds. Their backpacks have some great features, but lack the capacity for more than a day trip. I follow the company&#8217;s YouTube channel because it has demonstrated an ability to make cool things, and I believe it will make them better in time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="DIY">DIY<span>&nbsp;<a href="#DIY">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I love building things. When I faced buying a storage system for my 4Runner, <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">I chose to build my own</a>. <a href="/projects.html#caddProjects">I have grand plans</a> for future projects, and these give me even more ideas. Even more important, though, seeing experts practice their craft teaches me to improve mine.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMiTb1EJ5nhn_NbUyNu003w">Homesteadonomics on YouTube</a> - I came to Homesteadonomics on YouTube by way of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJEhXwOJ_CGahuF3NEXfECUAgeHs3rSES">a nine part series in which Joe built a camper from scratch</a>. He had me impressed. I follow his channel to learn as much as I can about building before it comes time to begin my next project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="Finances">Finances<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Finances">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I have some bold fiscal goals. These two sites helped inform them, and they help keep me on track, too. Sam, who writes <a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/">Financial Samurai</a>, and Dominic, who writes <a href="https://www.genyfinanceguy.com/">Gen Y Finance Guy</a>, both come from a background in finance. Sam&#8217;s hard work and shrewd moves allowed him to achieve financial independence at a young age, and Dominic is well on his way to doing the same. I hope to follow in their footsteps soon.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Politics">Politics<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Politics">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I read <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">a handful of political websites</a>, but just one political blog. Warren Meyer brings to the table an analytical perspective critical of both sides, grounded in his experience owning a private company that runs government-owned parks. I enjoy his wit, candor, and lack of bias.</p>

<p>I would not call myself a good programmer. I know enough <a href="/projects.html">to do some damage</a>, but the better I get, the more room for growth I see. These writers seldom talk about the basics, but rather the interesting edge cases, tricks, and lessons they have encountered or learned in their careers as developers. They teach me new things all the time, or just cover interesting tech-related topics.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/">https://www.hanselman.com/blog/</a> - Scott Hanselman covers writing and development at a high level, for the most part, but gets down into the weeds on occasion. He has a wealth of knowledge to share on all fronts.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitsofco.de/">https://bitsofco.de/</a> - At <a href="https://bitsofco.de/">bitsofcode</a>, Ire Aderinokun writes about front-end development. I have seen a lot of people brush HTML, CSS, and JavaScript off as solved problems, in an age where lazy browser rendering and fast internet connections have masked the importance of smart design. That tide <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-javascript-free-frontend.html">has started to change</a>, though, and Ire&#8217;s tips have helped me stay in front of this trend.</li>
<li><a href="https://davidwalsh.name">https://davidwalsh.name</a> - I have some strong feelings about the design of <a href="https://davidwalsh.name">David Walsh&#8217;s blog</a>, and much more positive ones about the great articles he posts there. David writes focuses on front-end development, but also covers languages and technologies on the back end as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani">https://medium.com/@addyosmani</a> - A Google engineer working on Chrome, <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a> writes a lot about ways to optimize the web. You may have noticed a pattern here.</li>
<li><a href="http://nonullpointers.com">http://nonullpointers.com</a> - Although a new site without much of a back catalog, Chris D&#8217;Aloisio has written some interesting pieces on the less technical side of becoming a better developer. I look forward to seeing what else he has to say.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/">https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/</a> - Mathew Green covers cryptography some, hence the name, but in more broad strokes writes great stuff on privacy.</li>
<li><a href="https://snikt.net/">https://snikt.net/</a> - Anreas Happe&#8217;s work on building an LTE modem got my attention, but I stayed for his eclectic writings on interesting, tech-related topics. </li>
<li><a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log">https://apenwarr.ca/log</a> - __ dives deep on all sorts of developer- and tech-related topics, and does a great job of explaining even the most complex ones.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/">https://www.justinobeirne.com/</a> - Justin Obeirne tracks Apple Maps&#8217; progress as the company works to map the entire country. The level of detail in his side-by-side comparisons of each version is exquisite. </li>
<li><a href="https://nrempel.com/">https://nrempel.com/</a> - Nicholas Rempel also all sorts of developer- and tech-related topics, and does so well.</li>
<li><a href="https://subt0x11.blogspot.com/">https://subt0x11.blogspot.com/</a> - This site has not seen a new post in over a year, but I keep it around in this hopes that it will. The three posts in its RSS feed, all from 2018, dive deep on some interesting exploits. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog">https://www.backblaze.com/blog</a> - I have used Backblaze for years, and have followed their website off and on for years. I re-subscribed as I grow more interesting in standing up my own homelab, which will involve some sort of network attached storage system. Backblaze&#8217;s detailed hard drive performance reports have helped guide that planning process. </li>
<li><a href="https://codefol.io/">https://codefol.io/</a> - Noah Gibbs writes about tech, leadership, and culture, all of which interest me. </li>
</ul>

<p>This last group of websites does not fit into of the genres above, but over the years I have found some great content here. I like the authors, and I like to keep up with their work.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">https://waitbutwhy.com</a> - Tim Urban brings a unique perspective to some complex topics, which he explains and examines at an impressive level of detail. He does not post often anymore, but I always pay attention when he does.</li>
<li><a href="https://zenhabits.net">https://zenhabits.net</a> - I took a deep dive on mindfulness a few years ago, and only Leo Babauta&#8217;s <a href="https://zenhabits.net">zen habits</a> lasted more than a few weeks. He reminds me to slow down when I get too wrapped up in life.</li>
<li><a href="http://blairreeves.me">http://blairreeves.me</a> - One of my favorite new writers, <a href="http://blairreeves.me">Blair Reeves</a> talks about tech, life, and writing a blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericdavis215.com/blog/">http://www.ericdavis215.com/blog/</a> - A former Navy SEAL, <a href="http://www.ericdavis215.com/blog/">Eric Davis</a> has some interesting thoughts on life, adventure, and philosophy.</li>

In particular, I enjoy his writing on tech and his DIY projects around the house.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nicoledieker.com">https://www.nicoledieker.com</a> - Nicole Dieker writes about writing, and while&#160;&#8212;&#160;like Jeff&#160;&#8212;&#160;she writes about a lot of things I don&#8217;t care about, she also writes well about a few things I do.</li>

<p>I like big-name websites for keeping up on current events, but I tend to find the best content on sites like these. The advice to &#8220;follow people, not places&#8221; has served me well, and I encourage you to start doing the same.</p>

<p>Many have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">explained</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk.html">great</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-risk-analysis-of-huawei.html">detail</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;the dangers of Huawei in the West. They focus on the chance of a hidden vulnerability in those devices, but ommit the fact that even top-tier Western devices have security flaws. This ommission implies that the decision comes down to accepting significant risk by adopting Huawei, in exchange for 5G, or accepting zero risk by shopping elsewhere. As this story demonstrates, though, Western tech may not have built-in vulnerabilities a non-Western nation-state actor could exploit, but it also does not guarantee network security. As this debate continues to rage, I believe we should keep this in mind.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/my-morning-reads.html">Keeping Up with Current Events</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-05-14 08:46:04-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-05.html">05</a>/14 08:46:04 EST</time>
<p>I have always admired the well-informed. Their ability to speak on complex topics, to make thought-provoking points about things of which I know little, impresses me. This happened again a few months ago, with a retired Army Colonel whose knowledge of the American Revolution, the geopolitical landscape, and war floored me. I absorbed all I could from him. He also made me realize that I needed to do a much better job of educating myself and keeping up with current events. I have worked hard to do that over the last three months. Today I want to talk about my strategy for keeping up with world affairs. The self-education side of this coin warrants its own article, so I will save that for later.</p>

<p>For most of my life, I saw no reason to keep up with current events. In short, they seldom affected me, and even if they had, I could have done nothing about them. I saw no reason to worry about the inevitable, or energy trying to change things outside my control. While that still applies today, I want to take a minute to highlight the reasons I changed my mind on current events. Many of my peers feel the same way, so maybe this will convince them to pay more attention.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyChangeofHeart">My Change of Heart<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyChangeofHeart">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Academia values smart people; the real world values intelligence. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/smart-versus-intelligent.html">I explained the difference the other day</a>. Outside college, rehashing an algorithm on Stack Overflow will not cut it. Success means bringing value to the table, and doing that means learning to navigate a complex environment with many moving parts and full of powerful actors. This requires a thorough understanding of the world, which one gains by studying its affairs through the lens of current events. Depth of knowledge got me to the beginning of my career, and breadth will keep me from staying there.</p>

<p>Current events can mean more than politics, though. Given my background, my definition includes new projects and services. As a writer, it also allows for the types of articles bloggers post for small audiences&#160;&#8212;&#160;like I do here. This redefinition helped me find the apps that became key parts of my workflow, and inspired some projects of my own. It also highlighted the work of small-time writers, who often make the best content. Creators flood the Internet with new content every day; paying attention to them, too, helped me find some real gems. This simple realization, and the huge impact it had, should make current events&#160;&#8212;&#160;no matter how you define them&#160;&#8212;&#160;much more interesting.</p>

<p>I also changed my mind because I realized I could learn from the smartest minds in any field, and ignore all others. I refuse to spend my time on &#8220;human-interest stories&#8221; or most of the other topics news networks use to fill time. These have no real value. Instead, I look to smart people for insights into a complex world, that will increase the depth and breath of my knowledge. Media outlets have lowered the level of public discourse in this country, but nothing says you must use even one of them. I worked hard over the last three months to make a list of high-quality and unbiased news sources, to help me become a more intelligent person. Those sites do exist, despite vast evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>So there you have it. I saw a need to go from smart to intelligent. The process I chose to get there has the added bonus of highlighting awesome projects and unique perspectives. Focusing on the brightest minds makes this a worthwhile pursuit. I consider the apathetic amongst you to consider that. Maybe you will change your mind. Either way, I owe you all a list.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyMorningReads">My Morning Reads<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyMorningReads">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I check the same sites every morning. Most days, I take about half an hour to go through this list. Sometimes I spend hours going down a long rabbit hole, though, and then more time catching up on the things I missed. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">I found</a> <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/">an interesting piece on China</a> a few weeks ago, for example, read nine related articles that afternoon, and over fifty others the rest of the day. I counted. Most of the time, though, this search yields a handful of pieces, one or two of which find their way here, and the rest of which I read for my own edification. I break these sites up by genre below, along with a brief note on each.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TechNews">Tech News<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TechNews">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Given my background, I like to watch the tech space. I have found that these three sites do a great job of finding the best content, the hottest stories, and the coolest projects from around the Internet. They do not miss much.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a> - The most interesting articles and projects in the tech space.</li>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/">https://lobste.rs/</a> - Hacker News, but with a more technical bent.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/">https://www.techmeme.com/</a> - All the tech news from around the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Cybersecurity">Cybersecurity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Cybersecurity">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I have to keep up with emerging cyber threats for my job. Although I would like to round this area out with another source, I have yet to find anything that matches the quality and depth these first two bring to the table.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/">https://blog.talosintelligence.com/</a> - The best source of exploit and malware news on the Internet. If you read nothing else in this space, read these roundups.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/">https://blog.erratasec.com/</a> - The personal blog of Robert Graham, a security researcher, and David Maynor, who also writes for Talos Intelligence. I enjoy their style, they cover a broad range of topics related to cybersecurity, and their articles always get me thinking.</li>
<li><a href="https://thehackernews.com/">https://thehackernews.com/</a> - I watch this site for new data breaches and exploits. It lacks the depth of the last two, but it does a good job of getting news out fast.</li>
<li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/</a> - Every time a list of cybersecurity-related sites comes up, so does Brian Krebs&#8217; blog. A prolific writer and self-educated security researcher, his background in investigative journalism helps him write a different kind of story than most in this space.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Longformwriting">Long form writing<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Longformwriting">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Although you will find neither of these on any list of sites for great long form writing, I have found that the best of those pieces tend to appear here. Most of the good long form articles I ended up reading, that I could also find on sites like <a href="https://longform.org/">Longform</a> and <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>, also showed up on <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> and <a href="https://themorningnews.org/">The Morning News</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://digg.com/">http://digg.com/</a> - Although full of clickbait, a few times a week I find something great on Digg. The ratio of gems to garbage makes me want to throw this site out, but the quality of the gems keeps it around.</li>
<li><a href="https://themorningnews.org/">https://themorningnews.org/</a> - Think of The Morning News as Digg without the extremes: it does a much better job of filtering out the garbage, but lacks the hits that keep Digg around. Still, the higher overall quality here keeps me coming back.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Politics">Politics<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Politics">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I had the hardest time finding good political commentary. Fox News and CNN have a reputation for extreme bias, and most other major outlets pride themselves on falling just short of those extremes. These three sites let me see perspectives on both sides of the aisle, and give me in-depth analysis with as little bias as I have ever seen.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/">https://www.lawfareblog.com/</a> - By far the best analysis of current events and the geopolitical landscape on the Internet. These writers post the most thoughtful, well-written, and well-researched work in this space, hands down. I cannot say enough good things about Lawfare. I read almost every article posted here.</li>
<li><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/">https://foreignpolicy.com/</a> - Aside from some subtleties that make me think a few authors lean Left, Foreign Policy comes in a close second behind Lawfare for its in-depth analysis and thought-provoking writing. I read almost every article posted here, too.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Miscellaneous">#</a></span></h4>

<p>These sites don&#8217;t belong to any one of the categories above, but I have found them all worthwhile.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dzone.com/">https://dzone.com/</a> - <a href="/projects.html">I code sometimes</a>, so I like to keep up on programming news, best practices, and cool new projects. DZone helps me do all that with high-quality, original content. It even bleeds over into the cybersecurity realm on occasion, and at least once a week has a &#8220;tips and tricks&#8221;-type article that teaches me something new.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/">https://hackernoon.com/</a> - A &#8220;community-driven tech blog&#8221;, Hacker Noon publishes articles from its readers. This makes for an interesting range of topics, and the moderators do a good job of choosing quality content.</li>
<li><a href="https://jalopnik.com">https://jalopnik.com</a> - I like cars, and Jalopnik is a pretty good car blog. I&#8217;m on the lookout for a better one, but for now, this will suffice.</li>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com">https://seekingalpha.com</a> - I have an aggressive plan to become debt-free&#160;&#8212;&#160;minus my mortgage&#160;&#8212;&#160;in less than two years. Once I get to that point, I will start invest all the money that used to service my debts. Seeking Alpha is helping me learn how to do that well now, so that when the time comes, I can make the most of my investments.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="NewsAggregators">News Aggregators<span>&nbsp;<a href="#NewsAggregators">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I use one news aggregator. <a href="http://popurls.com/">Popurls</a> draws from many of the sites above, so I seldom find new things here, but it does a good job of showing me articles I might have missed or glossed over. If I see a post here that I saw on another site, that I chose not to read earlier, I will give it a second look. It must have gotten popular for a good reason, after all. Popurls also draws from a few sources I do not ofpoop follow, strips out all but the hottest pieces, and presents them in a tidy package. I find value in this, too. As I refine the list of sites I visit every morning, I will get to the point where I no longer need this one.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://popurls.com/">http://popurls.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheFullList">The Full List<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheFullList">#</a></span></h4>

<p>To make your life a little easier, I list the fifteen sites I read to keep up with current events below. On new machines, I copy this list into a folder I can open in the morning before work.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/">https://lobste.rs/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/">https://www.techmeme.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/">https://blog.talosintelligence.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/">https://blog.erratasec.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thehackernews.com/">https://thehackernews.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digg.com/">http://digg.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://themorningnews.org/">https://themorningnews.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/">https://www.lawfareblog.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/">https://foreignpolicy.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dzone.com/">https://dzone.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/">https://hackernoon.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jalopnik.com">https://jalopnik.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com">https://seekingalpha.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://popurls.com/">http://popurls.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="headers" id="Newsletters">Newsletters<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Newsletters">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I take great care in choosing the last piece in my current events collection strategy. Newsletters command much more time and attention than a simple website, and I do not believe in wasting either. The first newsletter that makes that cut, the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/">Defense News</a> <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/ebb/">Early Bird Brief</a>, covers news on the military-industrial complex and the surveillance apparatus. If you work in one of these spaces, I suggest you check it out.</p>

<p>The second, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/">BIG by Mathew Stoller</a>, tackles &#8220;the politics of monopoly&#8221;. Mat’s historical insight and shrewd analysis makes these newsletters interesting reads, every time. As for the third, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4297773-wall-street-breakfast-brexit-hangs-balance">Wall Street Breakfast</a>, this one helps me stay up to date with not only financial news, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;to my surprise&#160;&#8212;&#160;many other sectors as well. The writers over at Seeking Alpha do great work.</p>

<p>I go back and forth on Ben Thompson&#8217;s weekly newsletter, but I have found a great deal of value in it as of late, and so I decided to include it here. Look to him for sharp technical and political analysis, even if that political commentary sometimes skews hard to one side.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/ebb/">https://www.defensenews.com/ebb/</a> - The Early Bird Brief.</li>
<li><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/">https://mattstoller.substack.com/</a> - BIG by Matt Stoller.</li>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/">https://seekingalpha.com/</a> - Seeking Alpha Wall Street Breakfast.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com">https://stratechery.com</a> - Stratechery by Ben Thompson.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sites help me educate myself, and help me keep up with current events&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the onus remains on you to work through this list every day and with intent to learn. If not, you might as well go back to Facebook.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-05-13 17:42:55-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-05.html">05</a>/13 17:42:55 EST</time>
<p>Nicholas Diakopoulos, at the Columbia Journalism Review, wrote a fascinating piece on Google&#8217;s growing influence over the news and its bias for left-leaning sources:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The data shows that just 20 news sources account for more than half of article impressions. The top 20 percent of sources (136 of 678) accounted for 86 percent of article impressions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that 62.4 percent of article impressions were from sources rated by that research as left-leaning, whereas 11.3 percent were from sources rated as right-leaning. ... A higher proportion of left-leaning sources appear in Top Stories.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The level to which Google decides the type of stories users see, and the algorithm&#8217;s evident bias in that decision, ought to chill even those who benefit from it.</p>

<p>In an article I will post soon, I mention the difference between smart and intelligent people. I have seen this explained in more ways than I can count, but none the way I define it. Rather than burying this in an already long piece, I want to talk about it here so that I can flesh it out and then cite it later.</p>

<p>Out of all my professors in college, I remember a few of the best. Two of these stand out as prime examples of the difference between smart and intelligent people.</p>

<p>The first, a programmer by trade and a teacher on the side, knew all one could know about C++. He had such a firm grasp on the language, and conveyed his knowledge so well, that I learned more in that class than any before or after it. This depth made him smart. The second, a programmer turned full-time teacher, knew the theory and science behind operating systems so well that he often spent hours on the subject. He could also speak several languages, and dabbled in a handful of others. This depth and breadth together made him intelligent.</p>

<p>This implies a hierarchy, but I do not see it that way. Becoming smart, a subject matter expert, means learning everything about a topic. Becoming intelligent means learning as much as possible about more than one topic, which entails understanding each to a lesser degree. Both have great value, and depending on the industry, some value one more than the other. In general, though, smart people fill entry-level jobs, who then become intelligent people to move up the ladder.</p>

<p>Over the years I have dialed in my writing process. I started typing posts in a textbox on Zoomshare; nowadays, I write in a powerful text editor, track changes with version control software, keep redundant backups, and serve this site with a back-end I wrote myself. I have set myself up well with a pretty neat workflow, and today I want to share it with you.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyDevices">My Devices<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyDevices">#</a></span></h3>

<p>At home, I write on a late 2013 15" Retina MacBook Pro. Although Apple updated this line a few times after I bought mine, I have no reason to get a new one. I <a href="/projects.html">write, code, and build 3D models</a> on it without a problem. The battery lasts long enough for hours of work away from my desk. I plan to upgrade someday, but see no reason to anytime soon. Those in the market for a new computer ought to consider that: how many six year old PCs still work today, and out of those, how many still run well? My DELL laptops used to have a thirty-six month life cycle. I have little interest in the Mac vs PC debate anymore, but I will say that the longer lifespan of an Apple computer makes the annual cost of owning one much lower, and means you will have a well-functioning device for much longer than you would a PC.</p>

<p>Away from home, I create on my iPhone. For the last year or so before <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">I stopped writing</a>, an iPad also played an important role in this process. I used the same workflow there that I use on my iPhone today, which I talk about below, to create almost everything I posted. I liked that setup: its simplicity and portability, and the focus it imposed, worked well for me. Since then iPads have become much more powerful, so I can&#8217;t wait to revisit this soon.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyEditors">My Editors<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyEditors">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Recall that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/why-i-write-in-plain-text.html">I write in plain text, formatted in Markdown, and that I proof everything</a> before I post it. On my home computer, I prefer <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. Cross-platform, fast, and feature-rich, I use this editor to write the articles that appear here, and the code that generates the site behind the scenes. It does everything I ask of it so well, it feels like a tool purpose-built for the job at hand&#160;&#8212;&#160;every single time. I cannot recommend this editor enough.</p>

<p>Before I post, I proof everything with a program of my own design. I once used <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked 2</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/integrating-sublime-text-and-marked-2.html">for this</a>, but grew out of the app, so I created <a href="/projects.html#proofer">Proofer</a>. Proofer takes a much more granular look at flaws in my writing, generates more statistics, and creates a live preview using my blog&#8217;s exact layout. This program has become an indispensable tool in my writing toolkit, so I made it available over on <a href="/projects.html#codingProjects">my projects page</a> for anyone who wants to check it out.</p>

<p>On my phone, I love <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> for capturing notes and article ideas. Its fast, simple interface makes that easy. I just open it and write. Most of the time I turn those tidbits into new posts on my computer, but every once in a while, I use <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> to create articles or edit ones I already have in the works. This app can access, edit, and save plain text files to the Dropbox account synced with my home computer, so I move my work from Drafts to this app before I spend any time developing it. Working in Editorial means I have a local copy and a versioned cloud backup through Dropbox in case something goes wrong, and gives me access to a host of helpful Markdown automation tools. Drafts’ sister app, Terminology, also comes in handy whenever I write in the go. Together, these three make it easy to capture new ideas, and streamlines their development into the articles you see here.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyBackups">My Backups<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyBackups">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I spend a lot of time, energy, and effort writing, so I cannot abide the thought of losing anything. To lower that risk, I use a tiered backup scheme. This means everything I write exists in at least two places at all times; by the end of each day, that number goes up to six. I have four different off-site backups, one on-site copy on a local external drive, and the original on my local machine. Thanks to some neat automation work, none of this takes more than a few minutes.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Dropbox">Dropbox<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Dropbox">#</a></span></h4>

<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/psa-dropbox-shouldnt-be-your-sole-backup-for-your-file-1612803794">Dropbox does not count as a backup</a>. In brief, at the free tier it stores deleted files for just thirty days, and it propagates all changes&#160;&#8212;&#160;even mass file deletions or corruptions&#160;&#8212;&#160;in real time. With that said, it can still fill an important niche as part of a broader backup scheme. By monitoring your files and sending changes to the cloud in real time, Dropbox enables short-term recovery should you spill a drink on your computer, for example, or want to reexamine a first draft of a document up to thirty days later. This service does a great job of covering the gap between the permanent backups below.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="VersionControl">Version Control<span>&nbsp;<a href="#VersionControl">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I use version control for all my <a href="/projects.html#codingProjects">coding projects</a>, and for writing, too. In the software world, this allows many developers to work on a single project at once. Anyone can change a file, add a note, and then send it to a central server where his or her colleagues will see the change. Every time I hit a milestone while writing, I add a note, then <em>commit</em> it to private repositories <a href="https://alexarmstrong.net/2015/01/pushing-to-multiple-git-repos">on GitHub and Bitbucket</a>. This accomplishes two things: it gives me two off-site backups, and lets me view older versions of an article anytime I want to. These repositories will also store every version of my files, even if I delete them, as long as GitHub and Bitbucket stay online. I rest easier at night knowing I can recover everything I have ever written, no matter what happens.</p>

<p>It does not take much to annotate and commit a changed file, and Ire Aderinokun makes it even easier with <a href="https://bitsofco.de/git-aliases-for-lazy-developers/">some helpful aliases</a>. I took this a step further with <a href="/projects.html#GitBackup">my GitBackup project</a>, which monitors a target directory for changes and then commits the new files with a generic message. I can still choose to do milestone-based versioning, but GitBackup turns these version control servers into a second real-time backup to two more off-site locations&#160;&#8212;&#160;like Dropbox, but without Dropbox&#8217;s time-based limitations.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Backblaze">Backblaze<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Backblaze">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Version control backs up my files on a per-project basis; Dropbox covers more of my system by monitoring an entire directory, but Backblaze tracks every single file on my computer. I pay $5 a month, and the company keeps a copy of my entire machine on their servers. Due to the volume of files it has to process, Backblaze catches changes about an hour after I make them. Thanks to Dropbox and version control, though, I can live with that gap. This service brings the number of off-site copies of my data up to four.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TimeMachine">Time Machine<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TimeMachine">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I also use Time Machine. Time Machine backs up everything to a local drive in my house. Although this will not save me from a fire, for example, I can use it to recover files if something happens to my computer anywhere else. Including this, my data exists in four off-site locations, one on-site drive, and on my home computer. Since everything except my local backup runs 24/7, I just have to plug one USB cable in once a day; in exchange, I get a comprehensive, overlapping backup schema that ensures I can recover my most important files no matter what happens, all for the low price of $5 per month.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MySite">My Site<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MySite">#</a></span></h3>

<p>We have gone over the devices I use, the editors I write in, and the backups that keep it all safe; now I want to focus on this site. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-firstcrack.html">I</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/firstcrack-in-practice.html">have</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/complete-overhaul.html">not</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">talked</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-i-do-what-i-do.html">about</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/firstcrack-10.html">First Crack</a> in a long time. Over on <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">my projects page</a>, I explain that I no longer publish updates to <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">the source code</a>, but hope to start again someday. That day has not yet come, but as I continue making major changes to the system, know that it will soon.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, I created First Crack in 2012. Powerful engines like WordPress and Joomla had dominated the space, but I had no use for the majority of their features. I wanted a lightweight blogging engine that would take plain text files formatted in Markdown, and turn them into a simple and fast static blog. Nothing fit the bill, though, so I created something that did. First Crack will turn a thousand articles into a fast and full-featured site like this one in less than two seconds. I take a lot of pride in this project and the progress I have made over the last seven years. Again, I will start publishing the source code soon.</p>

<p>Once First Crack builds the site, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli">the Firebase CLI</a> handles everything else. I can preview my site on any device in my local network with <code>firebase serve</code>, and then make it public with <code>firebase deploy</code>. It&#8217;s that simple. Look for a more in-depth article on this soon.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a>. I have three Terminal windows open on a normal day: one to commit changes to First Crack, a second for managing version control as I write, and a third for miscellaneous tasks while I work. tmux adds panes to a single Terminal window, all with their own bash process. In practice, this lets me take three windows and condense them into a single one. Crafting the command to create that environment took <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40009032">a bit of work</a>, but I figured it out. Now I store it in my <code>.bash_profile</code> file, which creates this environment every time I type in the letter <code>t</code>. The snippet below shows a more complex, five pane interface I used for an old development and writing environment:</p>

<pre>
$ alias t="tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; select-pane -t 0 \; split-window -h \; select-pane -t 2 \; send-keys 'cd /Website' C-m \; send-keys './start_server' C-m \; split-window -h \; send-keys 'cd /Proofer' C-m \; send-keys 'gs ' C-m \; split-window -h \; send-keys 'cd /GitBackup' C-m \; send-keys 'gs' C-m \; select-pane -t 0 \; send-keys 'cd /Standalone; gs' C-m \; select-pane -t 1 \; send-keys 'cd /Website/Articles; gs' C-m \;"
</pre>

<p>This gave me a five pane Terminal window, started the Node.js server, and checked the git repositories for changes to First Crack, the site&#8217;s content, and the Proofer and GitBackup code bases. From there I can start working. It also helped <a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/">to turn on tmux&#8217;s mouse mode</a>, and create a second alias to turn everything off: <code>alias kt=&#8220;tmux kill-server&#8221;</code>. I also find it helpful to have <a href="http://teamviewer.com/">TeamViewer</a> Host installed, just in case I need GUI access to my server.</p>

<p>Together these systems, programs, and services give me the ability to write anywhere without worry of losing my work, and manage this site from any machine with a shell. I can start working on my phone, finish an article on my home computer, and then use my phone to post it on the road. Whatever I want to do, I can with this setup. I have put a lot of work into it in over the years, and I believe I have created something to be proud of.</p>

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/integrating-sublime-text-and-marked-2.html">using Marked with Sublime Text</a> before I switched to <a href="/projects.html#proofer">Proofer</a>, so I wanted to take a minute to share the snippet that lets me use Sublime Text with Proofer now.</p>

<p>The code below creates a new Build System. Every time you &#8220;build&#8221; a text file with it, Sublime Text sends the open document to Proofer. Proofer then generates an HTML file that contains document statistics, visualizes word repetition, and highlights complex words and phrases. Open &#8220;index.html&#8221; in your browser and go to work.</p>

<pre>
{
> "cmd": ["/path/to/Proofer/Proofer.py", "$file", "-sublime"],
> "path": "/path/to/Proofer/",
> "working_dir": "/path/to/Proofer/"
}
</pre>

<p>To get this running on your computer, click &#8220;Tools&#8221;, scroll down to &#8220;Build System&#8221;, and click &#8220;New Build System...&#8221;. Copy and paste the snippet above after you fix the path fields, then save the file. If you have &#8220;Build System&#8221; set to &#8220;Automatic&#8221;, Sublime Text will now open build every file in Proofer by default. You can change this in the &#8220;Build System&#8221; menu.</p>

<p>I had a hard time getting Sublime Text to work with <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked 2</a>, back when I used Brett&#8217;s app to proof my writing. Dan Sturm posted <a href="https://doingthatwrong.com/home/2012/5/21/launching-marked-from-sublime-text-2.html">a simple snippet</a> that launched it using a build system, that failed if Marked came from the App Store. Here&#8217;s the fix:</p>

<pre>
{
> "shell_cmd": "open -a \"/Applications/Marked 2.app\" \"$file\""
}
</pre>

<p>Click the &#8220;Tools&#8221; toolbar menu, scroll down to &#8220;Build System&#8221;, and click &#8220;New Build System...&#8221;. Copy and paste the snippet above, then save the file. If you have &#8220;Build System&#8221; set to &#8220;Automatic&#8221;, Sublime Text will now open any file without a specific build system in Marked.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-05-02 17:56:12-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-05.html">05</a>/02 17:56:12 EST</time>
<p>A few days ago, I decided to start an article about my writing setup. Over the years I have dialed it in, and today I have a pretty neat workflow. As I started on that piece, though, I realized that I had never talked about why I write in plain text. Most aspects of my workflow traces back to that choice, so today I want to explain some of the reasons I made it.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheConventionalRoute">The Conventional Route<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheConventionalRoute">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Most people write in rich text editors or word processors. These applications create plain text files, then add a bunch of hidden code to cause the display of italics, lists, images, and tables. This makes writing easier, but it has a few serious downsides. For one, that invisible information can become bloated and unpredictable if the program does not manage it well. I used to write posts in raw HTML on my WordPress site, because I spent too much time tracking down weird formatting errors with its built-in editor. That hidden information may also mean different things depending on the machine, which can make creating an article on one computer and then editing it on another tricky. Some companies try to fix this by using proprietary code to control file formatting, which makes it impossible to view or edit these documents without special software.</p>

<p>Many blogging platforms include some sort of built-in rich text editor, which compounds these problems. These editors have all the same problems I outlined above, plus blog engines also tend to abstract the user&#8217;s file system: instead of storing the &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; post as a file on your computer, they will store it in a database. This adds another layer of abstraction to the mix: one more opportunity for something to go wrong, and one more layer I might have to dig through to fix it. Taken together, the alleged simplicity of a blogging engine with a rich text editor did not outweigh the serious drawbacks of unpredictable performance, cross-platform inconsistency, vendor lock-in, and an opaque storage schema. I planned to pour a great deal of time, energy, and effort into writing, and I could not risk losing all that work if some link in the chain failed.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheUnconventionalRoute">The Unconventional Route<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheUnconventionalRoute">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Instead, I chose to write in plain text. I made this decision for a few reasons, future-proofing my writing primary amongst them. I could take any one of these articles to a computer from the 1980s and read it; forty years from now, whatever machines we use then will still open that file. No one owns this format, and anything that turns on will read it. I could not accept the possibility of someday finding thousands of hours of work locked in a file time had made unreadable, so I picked a format that guaranteed I would never have to. I also chose plain text for its portability. Its simple, open, and predictable nature means I do not need a special program to use these files. I can view, edit, and save them on any device, with built-in applications. I can write on my home computer, access those files on a work machine, or even create full-fledged articles on my phone.</p>

<p>Plain text future-proofed my writing, works everywhere, and will stay readable as long as computers stay running. It did not win out in style, though: it does not support italics, images, and all the other features I needed to write readable articles on the web. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz solved that problem in 2014 with Markdown. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">The project</a> outlines a set of rules for formatting plain text files using special characters, like the asterisk. Once formatted, a small program converts those files into HTML for use on the web. Together, I now had a setup that allowed me to store my work anywhere, access it from anywhere, and never worry about an editor bungling my formatting, or database corruption losing all my work. I had found my perfect system.</p>

<p>I started looking at editors next. Remarkable functionality across the board soon made this a reason to stick with the format all its own. Features I would not have dreamed of in a word processor come standard in this space&#160;&#8212;&#160;things like Regular Expression search and replace, multiple cursors, automatic indexing, support for projects, and extensive customization and extensibility. I soon learned that I could do everything with a text editor I could do with a word processor, and then a thousand other things, too. These apps have a bit of a learning curve to them, but their immense value far outweighs the small amount of time it will take to adapt.</p>

<p>I now had a way to create and style plain text files, but no way to preview them. I settled on <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked 2</a>. This app parses Markdown <em>and</em> includes helpful proofing tools and readability statistics. It let me visualize complex words and word repetition, and gave me helpful figures that gauge my writing&#8217;s complexity. It even estimated the number of years of formal education needed to understand my articles. Marked 2 soon became one of my favorite tools, and I considered it indispensable for years until I replaced it with <a href="/projects.html/#proofer">a program of my own design</a> in early 2019.</p>


<p>When I decided to get serious about writing, I had a decision to make. I could have used a blogging platform, or written in some form of word processor, but the minor benefits of the conventional route did not outweigh the significant costs. Plain text gives me portability, I learn cool new things about my phenomenal editor of choice every week, and dedicated proofing software polishes my work to a level I would have never achieved any other way. I write in this format because&#160;&#8212;&#160;no matter how I looked at it&#160;&#8212;&#160;plain text beats out everything else, no contest.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-04-26 15:38:25-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/26 15:38:25 EST</time>
<p>I talked about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">my road to weightlifting</a> the other day, to give you insight into my background. Having reached each end of the fitness spectrum, and after going back and forth between extreme conditioning and extreme strength, I look forward to sharing with you the lessons I learned along the way. As I work to regain the strength I lost over the last month, I want to highlight some of the consequences of that decision. In doing so, I hope to better prepare you for this difficult journey, and help you avoid some common pitfalls.</p>

<p>No matter which end of the spectrum you come from, moving to the other means opening yourself up to injury. As a 220 pound weightlifter, I could lift hundreds of pounds without a problem; outside the gym, though, I had trouble even with short runs. My weight caused shin splints, stress fractures, and knee bursitis. Ibuprofen, ice, and stretching helped some, but switching to low-impact exercises helped the most. When I decided to jump back into conditioning, stationary recumbent cycling gave me the benefits of running without the damage. To those thinking about making this switch, take note. The weight that makes lifting easy now will destroy your body if you go about conditioning the wrong way.</p>

<p>As they set out to go from strong to conditioned, some may also try to do both. Although possible, realize that these goals contradict each other. You can overcome this&#160;&#8212;&#160;to a degree&#160;&#8212;&#160;with a lot of hard work, but that progress will take much more time and effort than it already does, and yield mediocre results at best. I once knew an Infantry Captain who prided himself on &#8220;outrunning the lifters, and outlifting the runners.&#8221; For those with similar goals, balancing moderate strength and conditioning does not take a lot of work&#160;&#8212;&#160;but understand that the people who focus on one area will always win. For those without long to improve, or in need of significant improvement, accept that getting better in one area means losing ground in the other.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, some may also try to stick to their old diet during this process. Do not make that mistake. Your body no longer needs to build muscle; it must now strengthen the muscle you already have, burn fat, and build endurance. I never bothered to get into the weeds on this, but I did end up cutting out a quarter to a half of my regular intake, by volume, while conditioning. I also ended up eating more fruits and vegetables. You should expect a similar change in diet, to fuel your body&#8217;s new mission.</p>

<p>To reiterate, in trading strength for conditioning, you can expect to open yourself up to injury, get weaker, and eat less food&#160;&#8212;&#160;but you can also expect some positive changes as well. You will get lighter, faster, and better at bodyweight exercises, of course, but you will also have much more time on your hands, and more energy to make good use of it. For the hour I sat on the recumbent bicycle, I either read or worked on posts for this site; the second hour I used to spend on the tail end of my workouts, I spent churning out productive work at home. Weightlifting takes a <em>lot</em> of time and energy, and conditioning takes much less; I put that delta to good use on my many side projects.</p>

<p>If the prospect of becoming weak does not bother you, trading strength for conditioning has few downsides. Take care at the beginning not to hurt yourself, and this route has some real benefits. I have long maintained that conditioning is much easier than strength training, and my experience over the last month supported that; the long, hard road back to regain lost ground confirmed this for me, but I will save that for another post.</p>

<p>I found this article after <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/2016/07/22/making-obvious-fast.html"><em>Making the obvious code fast</em></a>, where Jack Mott explained the impact of ignoring basic optimization. In his 2016 piece <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/tools/editor/ide/visual/studio/2016/07/01/marginal-gains.html"><em>Marginal Gains</em></a>, he went over some small tips to make developers&#8217; lives easier. He had some good suggestions, and I want to take a minute to emphasize one of his points.</p>

<p><strong>Use the command line as much as possible, so that you can automate as much of your work as possible.</strong> Most programs wrap one or more command line tools. This helps non-technical people. Take out the middleman, though, learn to use the underlying tool, and then write a script to work for you. Automate the boring tasks, so that you can focus on the exciting ones, take on new roles, further your own education, or even start a side hustle.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time optimizing images for the web, for example, <a href="https://imageoptim.com/command-line.html">let the command line handle that</a>. Do you work with videos? <a href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.2.0/cli/command-line-reference.html">It can handle that, too</a>. If you spend hours scrolling through thousands of lines of log files, <a href="http://droptips.com/using-grep-to-exclude-lines-containing-certain-characterstext">why not save some time by taking out all traffic to the server from your developers&#8217; machines?</a> You cannot do everything with the command line, but you can free yourself from the boring in favor of more challenging and interesting work.</p>

<p>Andrew and Nealie Barker write a travel blog, and in their latest post they talk about finding hidden cameras in the houses they stay in. Having the know-how to do things like this makes me glad I chose the cyber security field, even if no part of this process takes a great deal of technical expertise: you can do everything the Barkers talk about with simple apps found on the App Store. I do not make a habit of staying in others&#8217; homes, but if you do, check out this simple guide.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Popper, writing for the New York Times, explains the extreme steps Jameson Lopp took to hide his personal information. An interesting piece, it reminded me of a great article Evan Ratlif wrote for Wired in 2009 titled <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/gone-forever-what-does-it-take-to-really-disappear/"><em>Gone Forever: What Does It Take to Really Disappear?</em></a>. I also rediscovered <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/evans-interview-with-matthew-sheppard-about-disappearing-its-like-dying/">the interview with Matt Sheppard</a> that Evan mentioned at the end of his article, as well as his follow-up piece where <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/author-evan-ratliff-is-on-the-lam-locate-him-and-win-5000/">he attempted to disappear and offered a $5,000 bounty for his sighting</a>. These articles sent me down a fascinating rabbit hole, into the world of faked deaths and mysterious disappearances. Some of the best pieces I found: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyj8a4/heres-the-best-way-to-fake-your-death"><em>Here&#8217;s the Best Way to Fake Your Death</em></a>, by Mack Lamoureux on Vice; <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/08/07/how-i-faked-my-own-death/"><em>How I faked my own death</em></a>, by Dean Balsimini on the New York Post; and <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2017-12-16-the-hardest-part-about-faking-your-own-death-is-staying-dead/"><em>The hardest part about faking your own death is staying dead</em></a> by Paige Nick on The New York Times Live. With Gerald Cotten&#8217;s sudden disappearance, we may have a recent example of this happening again. Trista Kelley has a good writeup over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quadriga-ceo-gerald-cotten-death-with-no-access-to-crypto-gets-weirder-2019-2">at Business Insider</a>. I find all of this fascinating.</p>

<p>Drew DeVault on the dangers of using a virtual private network, or VPN:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[VPN providers] can identify you much more precisely because you used your VPN login to access the service. Additionally, they can promise not to siphon off your data and write it down somewhere&#160;&#8212;&#160;tracking you, selling it to advertisers, handing it over to law enforcement&#160;&#8212;&#160;but they could and you&#8217;d be none the wiser.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone thinking of using a VPN should read his entire piece, and Dennis Schubert&#8217;s <a href="https://schub.io/blog/2019/04/08/very-precarious-narrative.html">VPN - a Very Precarious Narrative</a> as well. I link to both of them in an upcoming article on basic computer security.</p>

<p>Matt Reyer talks about turning his web front-end into a much lighter client. I have done this for years with my own projects, cutting out external libraries and even non-essential Javascript and CSS until I had as minimal an application as possible. <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-1/">This is a growing trend</a>. My desire to avoid unnecessary complexity and code dependence drove the development of <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>, the blogging engine behind this site.

<p>Nicholas Weaver on the technical challenges to calling Huawei &#8220;safe&#8221;, and why that might not matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;...the code that Huawei uses, like so much of the rest of the code running the world, is simply a nightmare: It is complex, written in an &#8216;unsafe&#8217; manner, using &#8216;unsafe&#8217; languages. The scale and complexity make it impossible to analyze the code to look for new bugs, let alone efforts at sabotage. ... [and] the dirty secret is that most of the world&#8217;s computing infrastructure is a similar nightmare.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two takeaways: 1) Choosing to use Huawei does not mean choosing to invite the Chinese government into a network. United States intelligence agencies have on-demand access to these networks; do not be so naive to believe other nations refrained from using similar tactics to the same results. And 2) 5G may not live up to all the hype. Even if it does, improving 4G infrastructure as AT&#38;T did with its 5GE network may shrink that delta to the point where the risk does not outweigh the benefit.</p>

I liked the idea then, and I like it now, and so I wanted to take a minute to give you an update after I gave it a try.</p>

<p>I bought a container of the powdered Soylent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071F4Z16T/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_p.lLCb4TKFRY2">on Amazon</a>. At $34 for twelve 400 calorie servings, that came out to about $3 per “meal”. So although I liked the taste,  it did sit at the pricier end of the spectrum; yesterday I ate four eggs and an English muffin at dinner for all of $0.70. I had also just started powerlifting when I bought it, and the amount of food I ate every day made it an even less viable option. On a diet of well over 2,000 calories, Soylent became less of a meal and more of a snack or side dish.</p>

<p>Again, I liked the idea back then, and I still like it now&#160;&#8212;&#160;but when it came down to ordering a new bottle, I could not justify the cost. If you can get by on a much smaller diet, or don’t have time to meal prep, maybe this will work for you; I cannot, though, and I meal prep every week, so Soylent did not work for me.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-04-13 11:41:57-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/13 11:41:57 EST</time>
<p>I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">promised</a> some posts on this topic, and today I will begin to deliver. Today I want to talk about my journey to weightlifting. It took me a while, but I look forward to sharing the lessons I learned along this long and winding road.</p>

<p>I started going to the gym at sixteen. With 150 pounds on my 6&#8217; frame, I did not have much to work with. Monday through Friday, though, for about an hour every day, I built up a solid base of strength. I did not achieve anything spectacular, and I lost a lot of ground when <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">I started spending all my time writing a book</a>, but the routine got me in good enough shape to score 224 on my first Army Physical Fitness Test in 2014. I took that test a few weeks after I joined the Reserve Officer&#8217;s Training Corps, in my freshman year of college.</p>

<p>The Army may have taken a step in the right direction with its new fitness test, but it still values one aspect above all else: conditioning. Although it might deny that, the metrics by which it judges a soldier&#8217;s physical fitness&#160;&#8212;&#160;how fast they can run two miles, how many repetitions of a simple exercise they can do in two minutes, their pace wearing a 35+ pound backpack on a twelve mile march&#160;&#8212;&#160;tell a different story. The Army values raw strength when soldiers have to carry their body armor-clad friends out of harm&#8217;s way, yet goes out of its way to incentivize the opposite. I plan to talk more about this another time, so for now, I will leave it at that. After all but abandoning weightlifting so I could write my book, I embraced this new philosophy in the fall of 2014.</p>

<p>Over the next six months, I ran mile after mile every week, and repeated set upon set of bodyweight exercises to exhaustion. In other words, I did everything the Army&#8217;s physical training program thinks a good soldier should. When it came time to take the Army Physical Fitness Test&#160;&#8212;&#160;or APFT&#160;&#8212;&#160;at the end of my freshman year, I ran two miles in 11:36 and did over 90 push-ups and sit-ups in two minutes. I scored 357 out of a max of 300 points. I had mastered the APFT.</p>

<p>Over the next four years, I shifted my focus from the APFT to the one other physical task the Army measured at the time: ruck marches. In this event, soldiers load a large backpack with anywhere from 35 to 75 pounds, then add water, then walk or run up to marathon-level distances in boots and a full combat uniform. A typical march consists of a 35 pound rucksack carried over twelve miles in three hours or less. By the end of my junior year, I spent three days a week running five miles with a 55 pound rucksack in forty minutes or less. That summer, at the end of a month-long field training exercise, I finished a twelve mile ruck march in 1:42:00. Sleep deprived and malnourished after two weeks in the field, I averaged an 8:30 pace. I will not say that I mastered this event, but I did excel in it.</p>

<p>When I came home a month later, I felt tired and out of shape. Back to 175 pounds, I weighed as much at twenty-two as I did when I graduated high school. The last two months had sapped almost all my strength and ruined my conditioning. I did not feel inspired to re-conquer the APFT or ruck marching, though, so I set my sights on the one activity I had yet to master: weightlifting. I started lifting twice a day after PT, for over an hour each time, at least five days a week. I remember struggling through those first few weeks, lowering my feet to the floor and struggling to push myself up and out of bed each morning. My body got used to the abuse, though, and I got hooked.</p>

<p>Over the next eleven months, I made some good progress: I worked my way up to a 435 deadlift, 305 squat, and 275 bench press. I took a three week break to travel the East Coast in the spring of 2018, then in July I weighed in at 186 and scored 336 out of 300 on the APFT. Once again, I had mastered the APFT&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I had come nowhere near that level in the weight room, and so I decided to change my approach. This test marked my first steps into the world of powerlifting. Seven months later, in February of 2019, I weighed in at 220 pounds, deadlifted 585, squatted 425, and benched around 300<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; on arm day, I warmed up with 115 pound hammer curls&#160;&#8212;&#160;in each hand. I had become a monster in the gym.</p>

<p>All the weight that I now carried on my body and lifted in the gym, though, came at a price: high impact activities like running or rucking gave me such bad shin splints that some days I had trouble walking. In any other line of work I would have switched to swimming or cycling, but the Army does not believe in less damaging forms of cardiovascular exercise. So I ran anyway and dealt with the consequences as most soldiers do: with Ibuprofen, with ice, and without complaint. Then, at the beginning of March after I ran two miles in 15:36, I decided to try one last experiment on myself. I had an APFT in three weeks: could I cut enough weight, and rebuild enough of my cardiovascular conditioning, to once again crush the max score of 300? I had proven that someone could go from extreme conditioning to extreme strength, but what about the other way?</p>

<p>I spent the next three weeks proving that I could. Ten days before the official APFT, I gave myself the test to gauge my progress. I finished the run in 13:30. I had cut two minutes off my run time, with a week to spare. Then, at the end of March in 2019, I weighed in at 200 pounds and scored 336 on the final APFT. I had managed to reach each extreme on the physical fitness spectrum, and then make the trip back and forth between them.</p>

<p>I wanted to talk about this journey to give you some insight into my background. I do not take advice from many, and never from those who have not established their credibility with me first. I also wanted to write this so that I could highlight a few themes you will see almost every time I talk about physical fitness. I plan to spend a lot of time on these topics in the future, but in brief:</p>

<ol>
<li>Anyone can become good at anything. In high school, my BMI bordered on underweight; there, though, I excelled at running and bodyweight exercises. Nine months after graduating college, my BMI of 29 bordered on obese; there, though, I excelled in the gym. I trained and dieted a certain way to reach both of those extremes, a process anyone can mimic to achieve similar results. A simple choice meant the difference between those two types of people, between a conditioned me and a strong me&#160;&#8212;&#160;it had nothing to do with body type, innate ability, or any of the other excuses many use to explain their lack of aptitude in the area they choose to neglect.</li>
<li>It takes much more work to build strength than it does to become conditioned. It took me six months to become a great runner, but eleven to reach my first weightlifting plateau&#160;&#8212;&#160;and then another seven to top out before I let off the gas. When I decided to get good at running again, it took me three short weeks. I put work into conditioning, but I put a great deal more time, effort, and energy into becoming strong. I have seen this play out enough times to believe this rule applies to everyone.</li>
<li>Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible. Before worrying about anything else, worry about doing that; that is the single most effective way to reach your goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many will disagree with me. Genetics matter. Conditioning takes just as much work as strength training. Focus on your diet to maximize your workouts. Take rest days. While the people who believe things like that have a point, they always leave one important detail out: factors like genetics and macronutrients, and the type of training that best suits your body type, become important at such a high level that the average person will never need to worry about them. If the average person spent their time putting in hard work instead of worrying about all those other things, they would surpass every one of their goals. I learned these and many other lessons after years of long, hard, gruelling, and back-breaking effort; I look forward to sharing those lessons with you here.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;I have a lot of trouble bench pressing a straight bar. I can rep out sets of five with a 150 pound dumbbell in each hand, but when it comes to the bar, some form of tendinitis makes me struggle around 315 pounds for even one rep.</p>

<p>With all the talk of Huawei <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">over the last</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk.html">few days</a>, I want to spend a minute on AT&#38;T.

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-04-10 12:30:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/10 12:30:49 EST</time>
<p>Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist, and Steven Pinker believe nuclear power should replace fossil fuels, and serve as the backup that makes renewable energy sources viable. They make a good case in this interesting article on The New York Times, and I even found a few gems in the comments section&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of which pointed me to a piece on Bloomberg. Gerard Mourou, a winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize for Physics, has a novel idea to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-nuclear-waste-storage-france/">solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal</a>.</p>

<p>These advocates, and the scientists behind them, have many barriers to overcome before their proposal becomes a reality. As they point out in The New York Times&#8217; piece, though, it comes down to using a scary solution to avoid the guaranteed disaster that lies at the end of the path we walk today. If the science works out, we will have to choose between the devil we know, and the imagined one we have built up in our minds over the last half century. I&#8217;ll keep my finger&#8217;s crossed that we make the right choice.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-04-10 12:29:55-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/10 12:29:55 EST</time>
<p>I have spent a lot of time reading about China over the last few days. This reminded me of a great chart that broke down emissions by country, to make an interesting point: for all the attention it receives in the media, emissions from the United States pale in comparison to those of developing nations in general, and China in particular. In fact, <a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/nicolas-loris/even-if-us-cut-co2-emissions-100-world-would-only-be-0137-degree-celsius">the United States&#8217; contribution has almost no effect on global temperatures</a>. I believe we should keep this in mind any time the subject resurfaces.</p>

<p>I could not find the original graphic, and I try to avoid partisan sites in favor of more reputable sources, but failed on both fronts. Still, Nicolas Loris&#8217;s take on CNS News lines up with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/26/john-hickenlooper-green-new-deal-sets-us-up-failure-we-need-better-approach/">John Hickenlooper&#8217;s assessment of the Green New Deal on The Washington Post</a>, so I feel comfortable referencing it here. I have no interest in focusing on the Green New Deal anyway, but rather on the data opposing the notion that the United States must cut its emissions to save the world. <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/SY/SY18/20170228/105632/HHRG-115-SY18-Wstate-DayaratnaK-20170228.pdf">The research does not agree</a>.</p>

<p>I have more reading to post on the subject of climate change, but I will save it for another day.</p>

<p>I planned to include a link to this piece in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html"><em>Proxy Innovation</em></a>. As that article grew from a brief comment into a more in-depth rundown of the U.S.-Huawei situation, though, I pulled Herb Lin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk"><em>Huawei and Managing 5G Risk</em></a> out for its own post.</p>

<p>Where the five articles I linked to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">last time</a> focused on this situation at a high level, Herb Lin delves into the technical arguments for and against Huawei&#8217;s adoption by the West. As it turns out, the decision to adopt or blacklist the company comes down to a much more complicated risk-benefit analysis, even if conclusive evidence linking it to the Chinese government surfaces. <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/keeping-huawei-hardware-out-us-not-enough-secure-5g">Tom Wheeler and Robert Williams agree</a>. Check these pieces out, too, if you still want more to read after <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">my last post</a>.</p>

<p>World powers have a penchant for proxy wars. French involvement in the Revolutionary War, anyone? <a href="https://www.rbth.com/history/329015-top-3-unknown-proxy-wars">Little has changed a century and a half later</a>. We still see this going on <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/05/proxy-wars-are-never-moral/">today</a> in <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-states-are-turning-proxy-war-29677">Syria</a>, to name just one recent example. We also see this going on today in the fifth domain&#160;&#8212;&#160;cyberspace&#160;&#8212;&#160;with <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/">the rise of the Chinese firm Huawei</a>. Although some experts <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/07/we-cant-tell-if-chinese-firms-work-for-the-party/">argue that the Communist Party does not control it</a>, <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-foreign-power-or-agent-foreign-power-under-fisa-insights-sanctions-case">recent Justice Department actions paint a different picture</a>, and those who would know <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-former-military-and-intelligence-officials-letter-5g-risks">believe that the Party does</a>. Regardless of that speculation, though, none argue that the company owes its fantastic success&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least in part&#160;&#8212;&#160;to the tremendous support of the Chinese government. Those ties have caused the United States&#8217; government to array itself against Huawei, which will <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/05/in-trumps-economy-the-invisible-hand-belongs-to-the-government/">likely translate into direct support</a> for its competitors.</p>

<p>Here we see yet another example of a proxy war, except this time in a whole new domain. China used Huawei to assert its dominance over a technology that Keith Johnson and Elias Groll <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/">described</a> as &#8220;the central nervous system of the 21st-century economy&#8221;; the United States will likely attempt&#160;&#8212;&#160;in a much less subtle way&#160;&#8212;&#160;to win out with a company of its own choosing. And so the proxy wars will continue.</p>

<p>I want to take a moment to speak to my old readers. Maybe you forgot to remove my feed, never got around to unfollowing me on Twitter, or just stayed close and hoped that I would one day write again; regardless, I&#8217;m glad you did. What this site once was, however, somewhere for me to talk about the writer&#8217;s craft, Apple, and technology, it is no longer.</p>

<p>I never enjoyed limiting myself to these three topics, and so towards the end this became a free-for-all. I made a desperate attempt to save this site in the eleventh hour, and I failed. In the future, though, this site will much more closely resemble my blog towards the end of its life. The term &#8220;lifestyle blog&#8221; keeps bouncing around in my head, and I like it. I will spend some time transitioning now&#160;&#8212;&#160;talking about where I came from, what went wrong, why I came back, and where I plan to go from here&#160;&#8212;&#160;but having done that, I want to spend some time on some new areas. Now for everyone:</p>

<p>One of the primary topics I want to write about is adventuring: the vehicles you use to get the gear you pack to the places you want to go. Over the last year in particular, this has consumed my life in some interesting ways. I have found some great websites run by some fascinating people over the last few months, but I still feel like I have something to contribute. Plus, I have a couple of projects in the works that I think anyone in this space will find very interesting. More on those to come.</p>

<p>I still have a great deal of passion for writing, so I still plan to wax-poetic about it from time to time. I have added weightlifting to that list, though, and so you can expect to hear about that as well. I started in the fall of 2017 and show no signs of stopping. I don&#8217;t claim to know the science behind much of what I do, nor do I care to know it, but I have seen some impressive results. I look forward to sharing my approach not because I think it is right for everyone, but because I believe it is for some, and advice like mine is almost nonexistent in the fitness space these days. I believe I have something to contribute here as well.</p>

<p>Although I still have some interest in technology, and for the foreseeable future I will have a career in that space, I do not plan to spend much time on it anymore. Perhaps as it relates to some of the subjects above, but as for an area of interest all its own, do not expect much. One area where my professional life may bleed over into these writings, however, is when it comes to leadership. While I do not believe I have anything groundbreaking to share on this topic, I do believe some may find value in learning about my particular blend of philosophies. If nothing else, the process of quantifying&#160;&#8212;&#160;in no uncertain terms&#160;&#8212;&#160;my thoughts on this amorphous subject will certainly help me as a junior leader in one of the world&#8217;s largest organizations. I hope it helps others as well.</p>

<p>I believe in setting clear expectations. Although by no means an exhaustive list on either side, either on what I will cover or what I will avoid, even broad strokes such as these will help you know what you can expect from me, and will help focus my thoughts and actions from here on out. And now, it&#8217;s time to get to work.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-04-08 12:05:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/08 12:05:49 EST</time>
<p>So, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/simple-not-easy.html">I&#8217;m back</a>. I stopped writing almost four years ago, and a lot has happened since then. Although in the past I did not share many personal details, I want that to change, and I want that to start now. While I used to loosely limit myself to two topics, technology and writing, I plan to broaden my focus considerably in the future. I will save my vision for this site for a later post, but today I will start down this new path with a brief rundown of the last forty-eight months.</p>

<p>Since I stopped writing, I have done and accomplished many things. Some of these I will write about here, some in later posts, and some not at all.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Iwroteabook">I wrote a book<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Iwroteabook">#</a></span></h3>

<p>One of the first things I did after disappearing was write a book. When I stopped writing, I did so for a few reasons, but more than anything else I wanted to spend all my time on my book. For several months, I focused on nothing else: I stopped exercising, spent as little time on college as possible, and devoted all my energy to this project. My enthusiasm for it varied over the next two and a half years, but thirty months after I started, I finished the last round of revisions on a 50,000 word manuscript. I hope to someday dust it off and find a way to get it published.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="IjoinedtheArmy">I joined the Army<span>&nbsp;<a href="#IjoinedtheArmy">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I joined my university&#8217;s Army Reserve Officer&#8217;s Training Corps (ROTC) program around the same time I stopped writing. In exchange for up to four year&#8217;s college tuition, a lump sum each semester for books, and a monthly stipend, students&#160;&#8212;&#160;now cadets&#160;&#8212;&#160;agree to commission into the Army as a Second Lieutenant, an officer, and serve at least four years. I signed on that dotted line in October of 2015.</p>

<p>As part of that curriculum, I traveled to Mongolia during the summer of 2015, went to Airborne School in 2016, and attended a month-long training event in Fort Knox, Kentucky, in 2017. After Fort Knox I opted for an extra month-long assignment, CTLT, that had me attached to a unit going to the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, CA. On the first day of my senior year, I was sitting in a humvee in the middle of the desert. The thermometer read 105 that day. I finished my rotation there just in time to fly home for the second week of school.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Igotintoweightlifting">I got into weightlifting<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Igotintoweightlifting">#</a></span></h3>

<p>After a month in and out of the field at Fort Knox, and an NTC rotation on top of that, I got back to school tired and out of shape. My freshman year, when I ran two miles in 11:36, I had proved to myself that I could be a good runner. My sophomore and junior year, as I continued scoring well over 300 on the Army&#8217;s Physical Fitness Test even while I regularly maintained a sub-10-minute-mile pace with a 55lb rucksack on, I had proved to myself that&#160;&#8212;&#160;given proper motivation&#160;&#8212;&#160;I could excel at every physical challenge the conventional Army measured. I needed a new challenge, and so I got into weightlifting. I started working out twice a day, for over an hour each time, at least five days a week. Weightlifting became a passion of mine, and something I will undoubtedly write about in the future.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Iboughtmyfirstcar">I bought my first car<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Iboughtmyfirstcar">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Halfway through my senior year, I bought my first car. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiyiTqpss-ihtLHz-juFxIQ">Expedition Overland</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFf8PTHJTZwtMWLfFkAkS4w">Mountain State Overland</a> turned me on to the Toyota 4Runner, and after a lot of research, I went down to my local dealership and picked up a 2018 TRD Off-Road. I will write about this entire process soon.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Iturnedmycarintoanadventurerig">I turned my car into an adventure rig<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Iturnedmycarintoanadventurerig">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I had a lot of practical reasons to go with the 4Runner, like remarkable reliability and high resale value, but more than anything else I wanted an adventure rig. I wanted something that could take me anywhere, especially when that meant going off-road; something that I could live out of, whether that meant for a weekend at a park or a week in the middle of nowhere. The 4Runner fit that bill, for the most part, but it did need some modifications. I spent the rest of my senior year planning those out, and in the spring I got to work. I can&#8217;t wait to talk about this process, too.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Igraduatedcollege">I graduated college<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Igraduatedcollege">#</a></span></h3>

<p>In May of 2018, I graduated from Youngstown State University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Information Systems, and a minor in Mathematics.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="IcommissionedintotheCyberCorps">I commissioned into the Cyber Corps<span>&nbsp;<a href="#IcommissionedintotheCyberCorps">#</a></span></h3>

<p>The same day I graduated college, I commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the Army&#8217;s Cyber Corps. I had until July 18th to report to Fort Gordon in Georgia. My initial contract lasts four years.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Ispentthreeweekstravelingtheeastcoast">I spent three weeks traveling the east coast<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Ispentthreeweekstravelingtheeastcoast">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Between graduating and moving to Georgia, my girlfriend and I spent three weeks traveling the east coast. Friday night we started a twelve hour GORUCK Tough challenge, drove home Saturday morning, and spent the afternoon sleeping; by Saturday evening we had left for North Carolina. Fifteen minutes into our adventure I hit a deer, destroyed the left side of my new 4Runner, and set our trip back a day, but we still managed to get to Ocean Isle, NC, by Sunday afternoon. After a week there we headed north to Virginia, DC, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and finally Maine. After five days in Acadia National Park we headed home. This was the first in what will become a series of grand adventures&#160;&#8212;&#160;something we will undoubtedly do again, on the east coast and elsewhere, and something I will definitely write about in time.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImovedtoGeorgia">I moved to Georgia<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImovedtoGeorgia">#</a></span></h3>

<p>A few weeks after we got back to Ohio, we left again and moved to Georgia. I loaded my things into a U-Haul, hooked it to my car, and drove eleven hours to my new home in Augusta, Georgia, to start this new chapter in my life. I have lived here for over nine months now, and while I don&#8217;t see myself staying here forever, I do enjoy getting to spend a few months living on the other side of the country. Come May of next year I will likely get stationed in Maryland or Virginia, and so the adventure will continue.</p>


<p>I wrote this as much for you as for me, to make sense of the whirlwind that has been my life since I left. A lot has happened over the last four years, much of which I will write about soon. I may still choose to talk about technology and writing from time to time, but this list reflects my life on one side, and the new direction in which I plan to take this site on the other. It will be different, but as they say, change is good.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2019-04-06 11:12:52-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="/blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/06 11:12:52 EST</time>
<p>It&#8217;s been awhile.</p>

<p>Not so long ago, I wrote every single day. I posted something daily. Time I didn&#8217;t spend churning out those articles, I spent on my book&#160;&#8212;&#160;a book that now sits in a folder on my hard drive at just under 50,000 words. I haven&#8217;t opened that file since June of 2017.</p>

<p>I had a good plan, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html">back then</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;good enough that <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/07/rethinking-web-site-monetization/">some</a> people <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3024517/inside-one-bloggers-plan-to-make-money-without-hideous-ads">wrote</a> about <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2014/01/15/zac-szewczyks-tangible-goals/">it</a>, anyway. I had built an ample audience. With a few more months of growth, a couple of newsletters, a membership program, and a podcast, I felt confident I could make some money from this thing I did and loved so dearly.</p>

<p>As with any decline, my fall started slowly&#160;&#8212;&#160;and then happened all at once. Nine months after <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"><em>Doing Monetization Well</em></a>, I ended one weekly series with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-end-of-this-week-in-podcasts.html">a formal announcement</a>. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-1014.html">Another</a> just faded into oblivion. Days started passing between articles, and then weeks. Before long I had quit altogether. I stopped without warning, notice, or explanation, to both myself and my readers. I published an unfortunate dip into the political realm that unintentionally became my last post 364 days after outlining my grand monetization plan.</p>

<p>My strategy had been simple. Crank out a few hundred words a day. Link to something interesting, publish it alongside some compelling commentary, and intersperse those pieces with long-form articles. Rinse and repeat while the hit counter climbed. Get paid. Simple, but not easy. I have spent a lot of time thinking about this lately, both as it relates to my relationship with writing and life in general.</p>

<p>I excelled in high school. I did well in college. As I approach my one year mark as a Second Lieutenant in the Army, I continue performing near the top of my peer group. I am no smarter than my peers, nor am I any better than any one of them. Greatness is not a matter of intelligence, innate ability, or any special trait, though; greatness, as Ray Lewis once said, is a lot of small things done well.</p>

<p>Excelling in high school means spending thirty-six months waking up on time, turning in assignments by the due date, and picking a sport to round out that college application. Doing well once you get there means more of the same in a less regimented environment. A huge part of excellence as a junior officer is showing up on time and making a concerted effort to do the right thing&#160;&#8212;&#160;essentially the same list of small things one must do well in high school and college. All simple, but none easy, and so the number of people who make it from one stage to the next decreases at each level.</p>

<p>As in life, the key to my success here was a lot of small things done well. Post every day, grow the audience, and turn this hobby into a business. The path was simple, but not an easy one, and I burned out within sight of the finish line. Four years later I find myself drawn back to it once again. Expect to hear from me again soon&#160;&#8212;&#160;not every day, not yet, but here and there. I have a lot of lost ground to recover, and its high time I got back to it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been awhile, but I&#8217;m back.</p>

<p>This Week in Podcasts <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-end-of-this-week-in-podcasts.html">may have ended</a>, but I have no intention of ending my monthly Cabin Porn Roundups. For October, then, check out these neat little structures from across the world.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Pescadero-CA.jpg' alt='Tent Bungalow' title='Tent Bungalow' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Against a backdrop of beautiful stars and underneath a few old Pine trees, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98306965525/tent-bungalow-in-pescadero-ca-photograph-by-tim">this tent bungalow</a> in Pescadero, California, lights the approaching darkness as if with an otherworldly light.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Canyonville-Oregon.jpg' alt='Fire lookout near Canyonville, Oregon' title='Fire lookout near Canyonville, Oregon' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Somewhere nestled in the mountains near Canyonville, Oregon, someone built <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98310048605/cabin-built-to-resemble-a-fire-lookout">a cabin resembling an old fire lookout</a>. I have only ever had the privilege of climbing to the top of one fire tower before, but to this day it remains one of the coolest hiking destinations of my life. I can only imagine what it would be like to live up there.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Candlewood-Cabins-Wisconsin.jpg' alt='The Glass House' title='The Glass House' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Whereas the last cabin sought to free itself of its earthly bonds and thus took to the skies, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98316034470/stay-here-the-glass-house-at-candlewood-cabins">The Glass House</a> seems to not only accept the reality of its situation, but embrace it as well.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Whitefish-Yurt.jpg' alt='Whitefish Yurt' title='Whitefish Yurt' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Sean and Molly Busby&#160;&#8212;&#160;the owners of <a href="https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/shelter-whitefish-yurt">this neat Yurt</a> atop a mountain near Glacier National Park in Montana&#160;&#8212;&#160;are two very, very lucky people. I would love to have something like this someday.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Crested-Butte-CO.jpg' alt='Lean-to' title='Lean-to' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t exactly compete on the same fronts as The Glass House or the Busbys&#8217; Yurt, but there&#8217;s a certain undeniable charm to <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98748829825/lean-to-in-the-hills-above-crested-butte-co">this little lean-to</a> in the hills of Colorado.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Big-Sur-California.jpg' alt='Cabin in Big Sur, CA' title='Cabin in Big Sur, CA' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Apparently I ought to have renamed this post &#8220;American Cabin Porn Roundup&#8221;, because <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98808991966/cabin-in-big-sur-california-contributed-by">this neat little cabin</a>, like all of its predecessors, is from America as well.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Folkstad-Norway.jpg' alt='Cabin with an earthen roof' title='Cabin with an earthen roof' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>What a beautiful view. Replace the snow-capped peaks framing <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98891448288/cabin-with-an-earthen-roof-near-folkestad">this little cabin</a> in Norway with ones covered in green foliage, and this view almost perfectly matches one I came across on a trail in Ontario&#8217;s Algonquin Provincial Park. It was a bit of a climb, but so worth the effort.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Pocosin-Cabin.jpg' alt='Pocosin Cabin' title='Pocosin Cabin' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Back across the ocean to America, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/98974736217/pocosin-cabin-near-the-appalachian-trail">this &#8220;pocosin cabin&#8221;</a> comes to us from the woods of Virginia. Make all the jokes you want about the good people down there, and although many have at least one shred of truth to them, I would still love to spend some time living in this part of the country.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Clingstone-House.jpg' alt='Clingstone House' title='Clingstone House' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/shelter-clingstone-house">The Clingstone Hose</a> sits atop an island in Rhode Island&#8217;s Narragansett Bay, and although not a cabin by any stretch of the imagination, it nevertheless evokes a similar sense of rustic awe as the more primitive structures traditionally featured here.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Wooden-Shelter-Alps.jpg' alt='Wooden Shelter, the Alps' title='Wooden Shelter, the Alps' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>The first picture Cabin Porn featured of this shelter showed several carpenters in the construction process, and caught my eye. Although it did not stand out as particularly noteworthy, the second kept my interest, and I kept scrolling. The third, however, blew me away: perched 2531 meters atop a mountain in the Swiss Alps along the border between Slovenia and Italy, the view afforded from <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/99294622235/wooden-shelter-perched-on-a-mountain-in-the-alps">this cabin&#8217;s</a> doorstep is remarkable; breathtakingly beautiful.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/DeltaShelter6.jpg' alt='Delta Shelter' title='Delta Shelter' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/shelter-steel-cabin">Courtesy of Huckberry</a>, the Delta Shelter in upstate New York. Although the author, Liv Combe, might not think it particularly attractive, I like the modern, boxy architecture. Coupled with impressive defensive measures and a beautiful interior, this looks like a place I could see myself spending a great deal of time in.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-10-28 12:10:59-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-10.html">10</a>/28 12:10:59 EST</time>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I decided to make a concerted effort to stay abreast of world events going forward. Especially given the continued spread of Ebola across America, I could no longer focus solely on happenings within the tech industry as I have for the past two or three years. No sooner had I made this decision, though, than I came across a ponderous and subsequently maddening article over at NBC News titled <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/new-jersey-releases-nurse-quarantined-suspected-ebola-n234661">&#8220;New Jersey Releases Nurse Quarantined for Suspected Ebola&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>The article&#8217;s author, Maggie Fox, told of a nurse who had been forcibly quarantined in New Jersey after returning to America following a lengthy trip to West Africa. The nurse, Kaci Hickox, had treated patients infected with Ebola, and as a result New Jersey authorities had ordered her quarantined upon landing. This made sense to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;after all, it was thanks to a lack of such proactive measures that Ebola spread from Texas to my home state of Ohio, and will spread from here to God only knows where else because the infected individual did not have the common sense to regulate her ability to infect others, and the CDC did not have the sense to advise her to do so. The infuriating part of this story was not some perceived governmental overreach, then, but rather the nurse&#8217;s response to such reasonable measures: not only has she complained publicly, but Kaci Hickox has gone so far as to hire a lawyer to argue her case in court. Unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://datascience.berkeley.edu/data-media-map-bitly/">more liberal-leaning</a> CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/27/health/us-ebola/index.html?hpt=hp_inthenews">supports her case and paints the situation as a blatant human rights violation</a>.</p>

<p>Give me a break.</p>

<p>Ebola spread to America because of an unwillingness to restrict travel from counties known to harbor the virus, particularly for people known to have come in direct contact with the virus, and thanks to inadequate screening measures that were put into place all too late to do much good. American officials, those in possession of the power to actually enforce preventative measures, quite literally allowed Ebola to walk off a plane and enter the heart of this nation. As if this was not bad enough, they then allowed individuals that came in contact with this man for extended periods during his treatment to travel across the country. No wonder an isolated case in Texas spread to the midwest, and then branched out from there. Shocker.</p>

<p>Ebola may have started spreading across the nation, and continues to do so in a manner that looks alarmingly like the onset of a pandemic, but hey&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least only one person&#8217;s rights were so inhumanely violated as Kaci Hickox&#8217;s were before everyone caught on and stopped the madness. Thankfully, Thomas Duncan was allowed to enter the country without issue; it would have been terrible to quarantine him in such a degrading way as Kaci Hickox was. &#8220;Thank God for freedom, and an unwillingness to impose upon anyone&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;so says Ebola, anyway, because it&#8217;s thanks to our current, timid nanny state that we have this problem in the first place. It&#8217;s asinine, and unfortunately, unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>

<p>An incredible video from a group of hunters who make no excuses for their chosen profession, but who also approach it with the extreme respect that nature deserves. I personally have never had a particularly strong desire to take up hunting, but hearing Donnie Vincent talk about nature with such reverence showed me a side of this lifestyle&#160;&#8212;&#160;for to call it a &#8220;sport&#8221; would be to do the lifestyle Donnie and his companions devoted themselves a great disservice&#160;&#8212;&#160;that I had previously never seen. There is now little doubt in my mind that there exists a more noble passion than this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been moving further and further from the tech space lately, but this article still caught my eye from Aric Mitchell over at inStash. Here, Aric takes a short minute to chronicle his journey with Apple&#8217;s products, and then talk about the experiential side of the company&#8217;s latest desktop operating system, OS X Yosemite. This is by far and away the best piece of tech-focused writing I have read in quite some time.</p>

<p>For just shy of the past seven months, I have written weekly roundup posts talking about my favorite medium&#160;&#8212;&#160;podcasts&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the episodes I considered the best released during that time span. Although the number of shows in each issue varied from week to week, I like to think that the quality remained constant, along with my rate of publication: with the exception of a lengthy trip to Canada&#8217;s backwoods, I have not missed a single week. It may come as a surprise, then, that today I have decided to end this series for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Those of you paying attention, however, likely saw this coming: just <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts.html">three weeks ago</a> I introduced a single recommendation by way of a brief explanation describing my recent lack of enthusiasm when it came to all things tech, and the according shift in interests that brought about. A month earlier, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-without-podcasts-83014.html">I had nothing to say at all</a>. This announcement has been a long time coming, then, even if I failed to recognize it at the time.</p>

<p>Perhaps someday I will start again. In fact, I know that I will. However, to do so now would betray great things to come. Rather than spoil the surprise, I have chosen to shift all my effort elsewhere for the time being so that when I do finally make a comeback, it can be the best comeback possible. It&#8217;s time that I buckle down and do the hard work again, and stop coasting here.</p>

<p>Until next time, then.</p>

<p>Another week has gone by, made all the better with a few great podcasts. This time around, Roderick on the Line makes another appearance, and is accompanied by a great episode of Systematic and a fantastic episode of Zac &#38; Co. Enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-127-fermi-in-a-van.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 127: Fermi in a Van</a>. It&#8217;s no wonder that the only way kids learn these days&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least, the best way kids learn these days&#160;&#8212;&#160;involves increasing levels of technological involvement. From computers to infinitely personal iPads, we have taken these tools from a way to learn better and made it the only way our kids know how. But maybe they don&#8217;t need laptops, tablets, and smartphones in middle school; maybe, the solution is to give everyone a clarinet.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/117">Systematic Episode 117: Reluctant Selfies with Virginia Roberts</a>. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect going in to this episode, but Brett and Virginia had some very interesting thoughts to share on dating, parenting, and discipline in particular.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/zac/002">Zac &#38; Co Episode 2: The Moment He Makes The Choice</a>. To even list the topics Ben Alexander and Zac Cichy talked about here would be to do this episode a huge disservice, so I won&#8217;t. Instead, I&#8217;ll say this: two incredibly smart people got together to talk about some really interesting things in a conversation that I found riveting.</p>

<p>Another article courtesy of the folks over at Gear Patrol, this time a photo essay after a trip to South Africa&#8217;s Sabi Sands Game Reserve. I spent three months in South Africa a number of years ago, and hours upon days trolling through an adjacent park (Kruger National Park, for those curious), but only managed to see a fraction of the sights the folks did here. Even then, though, I have no complaints: Africa was full of majesty everywhere I looked. Ben Bowers saw some of that majesty in Sabi Sands, I saw some of it elsewhere, and we both walked away changed men.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-10-09 19:16:54-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-10.html">10</a>/09 19:16:54 EST</time>
<p>Although I started out <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html">confident in Coin&#8217;s eventual success</a>, I have since made no bones about my distaste for their <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html">questionable methodologyy</a>, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-coin.html">business model</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/509686863574343681">apparent inability to meet deadlines</a>. Burn me once, shame on you; burn me twice, though, shame on me: I&#8217;m hesitant to get behind Plastc given the apparently insurmountable challenges of this space, but that won&#8217;t stop me from wishing them success. At this point, I just want to see someone make actual progress.</p>

<p>In a day and age before ubiquitous personal drones roamed the skies, capturing incredible footage of active volcanoes, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dji-phantom-quadcopter.html">for example</a>, filmmakers had no choice but to climb into planes and film those breathtaking views themselves. Harrison Sanborn found some of this footage in his father&#8217;s archives, digitized the film, and turned the result into a neat three minute video on Vimeo.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a certain quality to this footage that newer, digital-first recordings courtesy or our aerial robotic minions just don&#8217;t have. Perhaps its &#8220;the celluloid warmth of the colors&#8221;, as Nick Milanes suggests in Gear Patrol&#8217;s article covering the video. Regardless of what it is, I just hope that we don&#8217;t lose it. There is always something to be said for taking the hard route, and the quality of the end-product when doing so, over that of the easier, increasingly mechanized approach.</p>

<p>Another week has gone by, made all the better with a few great podcasts. This time around, we have appearances by Exponent, Back to Work, Roderick on the Line, and Defocused. Enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-019-me-myself-and-minecraft/">Exponent Episode 19: Me, Myself, and Minecraft</a>. Great, great explanation of why vociferous argument is important amongst intelligent individuals, and why it does not occur between those who do not possess mutual respect for one another. All too often, many believe the polite course of action to be meek agreement with every point of view so as to keep from offending the one who espouses it. However, as Ben and James explain here, that&#8217;s simply not the case. The pair also shared some interesting thoughts on Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Minecraft, and ended after a very interesting aside on the current state of technology&#8217;s greatest players and how their business models inform their alliances and enemies. However, I found the insightful exchange at the front of the episode the most worthwhile.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/189">Back to Work Episode 189: That&#8217;s How You Roll When You&#8217;re a Lobster</a>. Why haven&#8217;t you started that cool new project? What, really, keeps you from taking on interesting new work when you hate your job? Merlin and Dan take a break from the comics and hit on these issues, to great results.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-126-big-cabbages-and-baby-pigs.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 126: Big Cabbages and Baby Pigs</a>. We as members of the human race tend to consider ourselves so incredibly smart. We stand up in front of our peers and pontificate, taking it upon ourselves to prescribe actions for one another out of some belief that one of us knows better than all others. In reality though, we&#8217;re all standing on the shoulders of giants, and basking in the glow of the twenty-five people who can actually do the things we attribute to humanity&#8217;s vast intelligence.</p>

<p>Also, Jeff Bezos just might be a modern-day super villain.</p>

<p><a href="http://defocused.co/defocused/ep-16-step-1-atomic-bomb-with-matt-alexander.html">Defocused Episode 16: &#8220;Step 1: Atomic Bomb&#8221; with Matt Alexander</a>. Matt Alexander, of the much-beloved but now-defunct show Bionic, made an appearance on the podcast many have used to fill the gaping hole left behind in the absence his weekly shenanigans with co-host Myke Hurley. The results are as expected, by which I mean great.</p>

<p>A great companion to yesterday&#8217;s post, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/10-typeface-pairs-for-cash-poor-designers.html">10 Typeface Pairs for Cash-Poor Designers</a>, for those looking to improve the design of their site through the adoption of strong design principles.

I have applied some of these lessons, too, in the creation of my elusive latest project. Look for more on this soon.</p>

<p>As I continue work on an as of yet unnamed and unreleased project, I came across this great article by Morgan Gilpatrick from a number of years ago that still maintains its relevance today. Here he puts forth nine different font combinations paired according to a matrix of criteria, and to great results. I plan on returning here and to other resources like it when it comes time to redesign this site once again; great advice, especially helpful to those of us on the fringe of design.</p>

<p>Another installment in my ongoing Cabin Porn Roundup series, where I collect interesting pictures of cabins and cool stories about the outdoors from across the world and present them in a single location. Much like my &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221; series, I feature only the best of the best here. Enjoy.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Antalay-Turkey.jpg' alt='Shack in Antalya, Turkey' title='Shack in Antalya, Turkey' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>It&#8217;s a little run-down, it&#8217;s probably seen better days, but <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/97141157742/shack-in-olympos-near-antalya-turkey">this little shack in Antalya, Turkey,</a> is beautifully simple as well. I especially like the crystal clear, seemingly impossibly light blue water in front of it. That water reminds me of the untouched beaches of a small island in The Bahamas, San Salvador, and the great time I had down there. Oh, the memories.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Invisible-studio.jpg' alt='Invisible Studio' title='Invisible Studio' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/97564979030/invisible-studios-workshop-near-bath-uk-built">This Invisible Studio</a> out of Bath in the United Kingdom stems from architect Piers Taylor&#8217;s organization under <a href="http://www.invisiblestudio.org/about/">the same name</a> and their joint desire to do interesting design work work in the field of construction design. And here, they have accomplished that goal to great effect. Even more impressive, though, is the fact that the did so for the low price of $25,000, and that they only used locally-sourced wood from the surrounding forest. Very cool.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Lychen-Germany.jpg' alt='River Shack in Lychen, Germany' title='River Shack in Lychen, Germany' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I love <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/97733853839/rustic-river-shack-in-lychen-germany">this river shack in Lychen, Germany</a>: it&#8217;s small, well-built, and you couldn&#8217;t ask for a neater location than alongside a river.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/foster-huntington-treehouse_h.jpg' alt='Foster Huntington's Treehouse' title='Foster Huntington's Treehouse' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-814.html">Last month</a> I linked to Foster Huntington&#8217;s website and picture blog. Between those two sites, he has chronicled his journey to build an amazing treehouse in the forests of Washington after spending three years on the road. This month, Outside Online chose to feature this project in their article <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/gear-shed/shelter/Foster-Huntingtons-Clubhouse.html">Foster Huntington&#8217;s Clubhouse</a>, and I just couldn&#8217;t pass up the opportunity to mention this incredible project once again. It may have been a month since I first came across this, but I&#8217;m no less jealous today.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Ragnies-Belgium.jpg' alt='House of 14 Facades' title='House of 14 Facades' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>M-Architects melded modern architecture with the rustic look and feel I have come to so greatly appreciate in cabins with <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/97648597866/house-of-14-facades-by-m-architecture-in-ragnies">this building in Ragnies, Belgium</a>, and the result is beautiful. I love all the exposed wood, and the large and plentiful windows do a great lob to make it feel even more open and spacious. Very well done.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/CalPoly-Pomona.jpg' alt='CalPoly Pomona' title='CalPoly Pomona' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/97818057605/prefab-cabin-design-by-calpoly-pomona-students-for">An interesting concept</a> by students of California State Polytechnic University at Pomona, using simple and easily-obtained construction materials to design and build a unique cabin for use in California&#8217;s state parks. Admirable not only for its ingenuity, but it&#8217;s architectural beauty as well. Color me impressed.</p>

<p>Reading this article from Outside Online, it reminded me of a story a family friend once told me. She explained that her son and daughter-in-law, both schoolteachers in Alaska, had decided to raise their young son without the traditional lessons society dictates a small boy learn during his formative years. As far as his dad was concerned, if he never learned to play baseball, that was just fine: instead he would learn about the outdoors, and gain skills that will benefit him for the rest of his life. Baseball simply didn&#8217;t fit the bill. That philosophy struck me as abnormal at the time, yes, but also wonderfully so: while this little boy&#8217;s peers learned to yearn for recess while a teacher droned on in the background, he would spend his time on things that actually mattered. Just because something is the status quo does not mean that it is right.</p>

<p>At first I attributed my absence of enthusiasm in a medium that I previously enjoyed so immensely a by-product of the increased demands on my time as of late. However, upon further consideration, and after yet another week of but one entry here in a list that previously contained double-digit items, I realized the true reason behind this unfortunate change: my interests had shifted. Just as I no longer derive the same pleasure in reading about technology and writing in speculation of Apple&#8217;s next announcement, I no longer take the same pleasure in the podcasts of the same genre. Do not look at the decline of this series as a step towards its demise, then, but rather the prelude to a massive shift that&#160;&#8212;&#160;at its end&#160;&#8212;&#160;will see both this series and this website stronger than it ever was before. And so, enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-125-all-the-great-shows.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 125: All the Great Shows!</a>. This week John and Merlin talk about presenting&#160;&#8212;&#160;both yourself and the actual act of conducting a presentation before large groups of people. The key takeaway, in my opinion: you can only hope to please so many people before the pursuit of that goal begins necessitating a betrayal of yourself. And at that point, what&#8217;s the point in continuing? How can you not feel satisfied with bringing joy to a small group of dedicated fans?</p>

<p>Until next week, then.</p>

<p>Incredible to think that today, in our modern society, things like this still happen. Not only do these sorts of things happen though, but they fly under the radar as well. Harrowing, to say the least.</p>

Already more than an hour down this rabbit hole of outdoor expeditions and the gear enthusiasts use on such trips, I started clicking&#160;&#8212;&#160;and clicking, and then I clicked some more until I had filled my entire Safari tab bar. And then, I began reading this humorous article by Mathew Scott from March of last year: <a href="http://expeditionportal.com/death-by-idiotic-purchases-why-you-should-never-buy-a-fixie/">Death by Idiotic Purchases</a>. If the only thing you, like me, love more than actually spending time outdoors is buying the gear to make that experience more enjoyable, and you&#8217;re looking for a laugh, this is a great place to start.</p>

<p>During September of last year I saw this incredible story pass by, but I let it go without comment. This time, however, I refused to make the same mistake.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy for us to sit in our homes decrying America&#8217;s defense budget, and say things like, &#8220;I look forward to the day the Air Force has a bake sale in order to raise money.&#8221; America&#8217;s military is not some faceless organization used to enforce the will of politicians, though: these are real people who put their lives on the line every single day so that you do not have to; these are real people who willingly fly to their death for their fellow Americans. Yet so many have the audacity, the gall, to stand up and criticize those whom they have no right to call into question&#160;&#8212;&#160;their motivations, lifestyle, and everyday choices. And this infuriates me. Render respect where it is due.</p>

<p>For those of you still confused, it is due here.</p>

<p>Lots of John Roderick this time around, not that that&#8217;s a bad thing, interrupted only by a fantastic episode of Exponent with Ben Thompson and James Allworth. As always, enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-017-lets-end-it-there-updated/">Exponent Episode 17: Let&#8217;s End it There</a>. This week, Ben Thompson and James Allworth use the Apple Watch as a lens to look at the value proposition of wearable technology and the challenges this emerging segment faces. Later, they circled back around to Apple&#8217;s latest device once more with an excellent discussion regarding the &#8220;Why?&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;or lack thereof&#160;&#8212;&#160;of this watch and the detrimental side effects of Apple&#8217;s apparent lack of focus and direction in its creation. I have found even less value in the Apple event post-mortems this year than usual, but this episode is fantastic.</p>

John Chidgey has Vic Hudson on to take an interesting look at the often unconsidered challenges DIDO&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, drive in, drive out&#160;&#8212;&#160;and FIFO&#160;&#8212;&#160;fly in, fly out&#160;&#8212;&#160;work situations pose not only to the workers themselves, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;more importantly&#160;&#8212;&#160;their families as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/113">Systematic Episode 113: Roderick Part III</a>. John Roderick returns to complete his three-part saga, this time focusing on life after his backpacking trip across Europe and his time with Harvey Danger, only to close the hour with another ten years of his life left undocumented. So, Brett invited John back for a fourth installment of &#8220;the sideline to Roderick on the Line&#8221;, and what will (unfortunately) probably be the concluding episode. Here&#8217;s to hoping Brett will find a way to get John back on many, many more times in the future.</p>

<p>Quite some time ago, in a life before this one, I wrote an article that gained quite a bit of attention titled, &#8220;The Comprehensive Terminal Guide&#8221;. Someday, I hope to update and re-release that piece here. Meanwhile, Craig Hockenberry wrote and published an even longer, even more in-depth, and undoubtedly much better article than mine simply titled, &#8220;<a href="http://furbo.org/2014/09/03/the-terminal/">The Terminal</a>&#8221;. Although he geared his more towards power users, users of all skill levels will find value in this monster of a piece. I consider myself fairly competent when it comes to the UNIX terminal, but Craig had already taught me a thing or two within the first few sections. If you have ever wanted to take better control of your computer, this is a great jumping-off point.</p>

<p>This is just incredible.</p>

<p>We as a species have a tendency to hold ourselves above all things both animate and inanimate in this world. Humans place themselves above nature, animals, and even one another. The trope of an invincible teenager is not exclusive to that age group, for at some level we all consider ourselves untouchable. And then, in the midst of this mis-placed mixture of entitlement and pride, videos like this appear to put us in our place&#160;&#8212;&#160;to exhibit our insignificance and utter frailty in the face of the majesty belonging to that which we so often disregard.</p>

<p>This week we see the return of my favorite podcast, Roderick on the Line, to this list with an even better episode than usual. Also making an appearance we have The Campfire Project, Exponent, and Grit; a fantastic roster, if I do say so myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecampfireproject.com/episodes/025">The Campfire Project Episode 25: I Probably Shouldn&#8217;t Say This, But...</a>. Jim Dalrymple joins Matt and Chris to talk about everything web publishing, from distribution methods to marketing tactics and the current state of Newsstand publishing on iOS.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-123-your-mom-doesnt-work-here.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 123: Your Mom Doesn&#8217;t Work Here Anymore</a>. Fantastic episode where John talks about, among other things, moderating a panel on three relatively safe topics: cats, juggalos, and bullying. Talk about a minefield. The insights he gained from that experience though, which he shares here, are fascinating. He and Merlin follow this thread and spend the rest of the episode talking about culture, beliefs, enforcing your version of either on others, and the inherently flawed notion of &#8220;fair&#8221;. Great, great discussion; I can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-016-naked-people/">Exponent Episode 16: Naked People</a>. Using James Allworth&#8217;s recent trip to Burning Man as a jumping-off point, he and Ben Thompson delve into a fascinating and insightful conversation on political beliefs and just what informs them, and how even the smallest realizations can dramatically change them for the better. As a young person without any hard and fast political allegiances, or much of an interest in this space at all, I found this episode particularly interesting and eminently worthwhile. Excellent.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/quit/54">Grit Episode 54: Something Mister Miyagi Said</a>. Lots of people say that they want to write&#160;&#8212;&#160;that this is what they would love to do, and where their passion lies. But, as Dan Benjamin points out here, if writing is not the thing you come home to do after working all day, and if you do not write instead of watching your favorite TV show and going out with your friends, maybe writing isn&#8217;t really what you want to do. If you truly harbor a love for the writer&#8217;s craft, nothing will stand in your way. This week, on Grit, Dan tackles this tough point and takes questions from callers as well.</p>

<p>As usual, a great post by Joe Steel over at Unauthoritative Pronouncements where he tackles the now-inflammatory issue of Markdown and its numerous variants, and goes on to explain why he cannot get behind Jeff Atwood&#8217;s &#8220;Standard Markdown&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;later renamed to &#8220;Common Markdown&#8221;, and then finally &#8220;CommonMark&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;play. I completely agree with every point Joe made. However, I will say that although I do agree with Joe, I cannot get behind the undertone vilifying Jeff Atwood running beneath a number of the articles I have read on this topic. If <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">Jeff&#8217;s latest blog post</a> is anything to go by, he meant no offense in the first place. In fact, Jeff gave John Gruber multiple opportunities to express any issues with any aspect of his project, but John could not be bothered to respond. As <a href="http://peroty.com/blog/wrote-about/mark-down-will-make-you-a-great-deal-on-formatted-text/">Carl Holscher pointed out</a>, adults should have acted like adults to begin with, aired their grievances promptly and privately, and then proceeded with an interesting project sans the drama. Act your age, and not your font size.</p>

<p>Possible the only impartial take on the recent Markdown flareup you will find anywhere, Sid O&#8217;Neill took this opportunity to make a great work of prose rather than a declaration of support in favor of one side or the other. Take this opportunity to enjoy an article for the excellent craft it contains, rather than the point it attempts to make.</p>

<p>Every day like clockwork, I copy a small text file out of a staging directory. Shortly thereafter, a Python script pulls the contents of that file out, parses it, and then places each line into a webpage that then gets pushed up to a server managed by a good friend of mine. Within a few seconds of that page going live, the handy Bitly bookmarklet gives me a shortened URL that I then send out to the world thanks to the magic of Tweetbot.</p>

<p>Every day, I publish a new article to my website&#160;&#8212;&#160;like clockwork. But although it may appear so, I cannot remember the last time I wrote every day&#160;&#8212;&#160;like clockwork&#160;&#8212;&#160;for it has been quite some time indeed. Instead, I hoard each morsel of prose like an animal driven by instinct to prepare for winter or perish in the face of it. But why? Why do I feel the need to keep up a facade of consistency when my life and schedule as a writer is anything but consistent?</p>

<p>Every time I find something to write about, I finish the article and store it away so as to conform to a strict schedule of one post per day. Although I may have read about <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/i-ghostwrote-hundreds-of-chinese-students-ivy-league-admissions-essays-897">a black market college admissions essay writer</a> one week, for example, as far as everyone else is concerned I came upon it <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/i-ghostwrite-ivy-league-essays.html">an entire week later</a>; and such is the case with nearly everything I write. But why? What drives this primordial urge to conform to a set pattern and put forth the semblance of professionalism in an area that I feel anything but professional?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea. Perhaps it stems from convention, or from a desire to emulate those whom I admire. Regardless of where this desire comes from though, one thing is for sure: I hate it. I hate going to bed after emptying the last article in my queue and wondering how I will meet the next day&#8217;s quota, as if there were some horrible force that I had to keep at bay through my writing alone. There is no greater self-imposed source of guilt in my life right now than failing to meet my own expectations in this one area, and I&#8217;m tired of it. It has wore me down, and I&#8217;m done.</p>

<p>For the past two weeks, I have immersed myself in another side of the internet&#160;&#8212;&#160;one previously unfamiliar to myself and almost undoubtedly alien to most of the people who follow me and read this website. Despite its unfamiliarity though, it has captured my interest and enthusiasm in a way that few topics ever have, and to such a degree that no other subject has managed since before I started writing here. I have thought of little else for two weeks, and have devoted every spare moment to it; however, I did so to much consternation on my part, because focusing there meant that I was not writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;that I was not working to meet my self-imposed expectations.</p>

<p>Over the past two weeks, then, I have managed to turn a great source of joy in my life, writing, into a worrying source of distress&#160;&#8212;&#160;and for what? This is the third time I have asked that question in this article, the umpteenth time I have asked it over the past fourteen days, and perhaps the hundredth time I have asked it of myself in the last month or two. Each time I ask it, though, I come up with the same answer. That is to say, none. And so, today, I&#8217;m done asking it&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;m doing asking it, and I&#8217;m done causing it to be asked. From here on out I choose to write about what I want, when I want to; with this I choose to eschew my selfish regimen and approach this intensely personal task as it should be: with reverence and respect.</p>

<p>Think of this as a warning, for you have now been warned. From here on out, anything goes. I extend this a courtesy to you, dear reader, because I consider you deserving of some notice before I take this train down a path that could very well derail it from the route you have climbed on in expectation of. Today, I break the carefully-crafted facade; today, this truly becomes my website. I hope you will stick around, but I will not hold it against you if you choose not to.</p>

<p>Coming back from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-without-podcasts-83014.html">a week without podcasts</a>, I have two great episodes to showcase this time around. Here&#8217;s to fantastic podcasts, then, and their continued, well-deserved success.</p>

<p><a href="http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-34-my-code-s-nicer-than-your-code">Pragmatic Episode 34: My Code&#8217;s Nicer than Your Code</a>. John Chidgey has Guy English on to talk about a topic with a much longer shelf life than coding itself: conventions and best practices. Although I don&#8217;t agree with every philosophy John put forth here, I recognize that such practices are a matter of intense personal preference. Just because I believe my way to be better than his does not necessarily mean that it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/184">Back to Work Episode 184: Days of Bathrooms Past</a>. Get through what some will consider a difficult trial, and others a humorous anecdote, and Dan and Merlin have some fascinating insights to share with regards to expertise and momentum. This most definitely is what the listeners tune in for.</p>

<p>Until next week, when I will hopefully have had more time to catch up on all the wonderful shows I keep missing. Here&#8217;s to hoping, as well.</p>

<p>The idea that one could survive and prosper based on their merits alone is a comforting idea. If this story teaches us anything though, it teaches us that increasingly, it is nothing more than that&#160;&#8212;&#160;little more than a comforting notion in a world where mom and dad can open their wallets to make any door spring open before their baby. I signed eight years of my life away in exchange for a four-year education, and while <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/looking-to-the-future.html">I don&#8217;t regret that decision in the least</a>, it&#8217;s remarkably disheartening to see others reap similar rewards in exchange for their father&#8217;s signature and a brief &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/walk-it-off-brother.html">first</a> came across Rohan Anderson and his writing through a video titled &#8220;<a href="http://vimeo.com/48864768">The Smokehouse</a>&#8221;, where he talked about and demonstrated his efforts to construct a smokehouse completely by hand. Since that cool winter night almost a year ago now, I have continued following Rohan&#8217;s activities through his excellent blog, <a href="http://wholelarderlove.com/">Whole Larder Love</a>, and have linked to a number of his articles in the weeks and months since then. If my implicit endorsement of everything he says and stands for has not been enough to warrant your attention, though, let me come out and say it once more, this time explicitly: if you have any interest whatsoever in the outdoors, farming, sustainability, independence, health, cooking, photography, or alternative lifestyles, I implore you to spend some time learning about Rohan&#8217;s lifestyle choices and the reasons he made those decisions. And this post, <a href="http://wholelarderlove.com/an-idealistic-notion/">An idealistic notion</a>, is a great place to start.</p>

<p>This is a continuation of my ongoing Cabin Porn Roundup series, where I collect interesting pictures of cabins and cool stories about the outdoors from across the world and present them in a single location. Much like my &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221; series, I feature only the best of the best here. Enjoy.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Riverside-a-frame-Alaska.jpg' alt='Riverside a-frame in Seward, Alaska.' title='Riverside a-frame in Seward, Alaska.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Whenever anyone talks about Alaska, it conjures mental images of barren snowscapes akin to those of the Antarctic Tundra. However, although certain seasons do cause such environments to spring forth, characterizing the entire state as such is no more accurate than assuming all of Nevada is dessert: in reality, Alaska gets more seasons than oft-lauded southern states like Florida. Further, interestingly, although many are quick to dismiss Alaska as a credible option for any but rugged outdoorsmen, I have never heard anything but high praise for the state from everyone who has ever actually visited it, and even greater accolades from those who live there. Compare that with states like the aforementioned Florida of which many refer to as a nice place to visit but no place to live, and we find ourselves with an interesting dichotomy: what alienates the former while endearing the latter to the masses, yet leads to this disparity in real world experience? I cannot say for sure, having only lived in one of the two states, but I would love to spend some time in Alaska to find out, especially if I could stay in a neat cabin like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/93502069692/riverside-a-frame-in-seward-alaska-contributed">this a-frame in Seward</a>.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Treehouse-in-Turkey.jpg' alt='Tree house in the mountains of Turkey.' title='Tree house in the mountains of Turkey.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I have wanted for a tree house ever since I can remember, and <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/93877892951/tree house-in-the-mountains-near-eskisehir-turkey">this one situated in the mountains of Turkey</a>, with an incredible view of a valley below, certainly has not made the fact that I do not have one any easier to bear. Beautiful&#160;&#8212;&#160;both the tree house and its view.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no cabin, that&#8217;s for sure, but I just couldn&#8217;t resist including <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/escapes/base-camp/A-Sleek-Escape-Amongst-Icelands-Rough-Edges.html">this beautiful Icelandic structure</a> in this week&#8217;s roundup. Surrounded by lava fields, geysers, and streams, this hotel&#8217;s setting combines uniquely with the comforts of an upscale lodge to provide an attractive tandem offering for both ends of the spectrum. After a day out in the field, I can&#8217;t think of a place I would rather stay.</p>

<p>The more time I spend putting together these lists, the more often it seems I end up linking to cabins in California. Having done quite well at making a name for itself as a remarkably liberal state known largely for its large population centers, every time I see &#8220;California&#8221; tacked on at the end of a description, it surprises me. Pleasantly, I ought to add: its great to see that even in the most unlikely of places, beautiful natural getaways such as <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94069281645/a-frame-in-poso-park-sequoia-national-forest">this A-frame in Posey, California</a>, still exist.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Treehouse-paradise-columbia-river-valley.jpg' alt='The burgeoning tree house paradise in the Columbia River Valley, WA.' title='The burgeoning tree house paradise in the Columbia River Valley, WA.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Back to the topic of tree houses, Foster Huntington is building <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94357908310/the-burgeoning-treehouse-paradise-of-foster">an incredible one</a> in the Columbia River Valley of West Virgina. The picture above in no way does this impressive structure justice though, so I highly encourage you to check out his picture blog for the project over at <a href="http://thecindercone.com">The Cinder Cone</a> and read his story at <a href="http://www.arestlesstransplant.com/the-cinder-cone/">A Restless Transplant</a>. Words cannot convey just how impressed and jealous I am of him right now. Amazing.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Cabin-on-Luchon-peak.jpg' alt='Cabin on Luchon peak, French Pyrenees.' title='Cabin on Luchon peak, French Pyrenees.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Amazing setting: <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94557476225/cabin-on-luchon-peak-french-pyrenees">this small red cabin</a>, perched atop the Luchon Peak in the French Pyrenees, looks minuscule when framed against the massive mountain behind it. Great picture.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Shelter-in-Norway.jpg' alt='Shelter in Sandhornoy, Norway.' title='Shelter in Sandhornoy, Norway.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>If nothing else, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94727504130/shelter-in-sandhornoy-norway-created-by-students">this shelter in Sandhornoy, Norway</a>, created by students for the SALT festival, is interesting to look at. Beyond that, though, I&#8217;m not quite sure what to think. If forced to give an opinion though, I would say its creators pursued the notion of modern architecture much too far here in choosing form over function to the extreme.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Mount-Brown-Hut-in-Westland.jpg' alt='Mt. Brown Hut in Westland, New Zealand' title='Mt. Brown Hut in Westland, New Zealand' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>If it has not become readily apparent yet, I have a thing for mountains: the only thing I love more than a towering, monolithic mountain range is the view they afford from their top; it&#8217;s both spectacular and frustratingly indescribable. So although there is nothing particularly noteworthy about <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/95100486799/mt-brown-hut-in-westland-new-zealand">this cabin atop Mount Brown in New Zealand</a>, perhaps with the exception of its color, the view behind it is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Freiburg-Germany.jpg' alt='Freiburg, Germany' title='Freiburg, Germany' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Hat-tip to Sid O&#8217;Neill for <a href="https://twitter.com/sidoneill/status/501722823224991744">pointing this one out</a>, Unsplash posted a neat picture of <a href="http://unsplash.com/post/95144460349/download-by-stephy-pariande-marzian">a small cabin in Freiburg, Germany</a> that looks a lot like the tree house I wanted to build years ago, when I was a kid. Nothing too special, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be.</p>

<p>For the past five months I have continued publishing a series of articles dubbed &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221;. Born of my love for the medium, I have curated these lists to great results, and to my great enjoyment. However, this week I find myself in an unfortunate position: although I have worked diligently to get through my growing queue of unplayed podcast episodes over the past week, I have yet to find anything that merits inclusion in this list. I have had the privilege of listening to some great shows, but nothing struck me as particularly excellent and worthy of mention, unfortunately. And so, I have nothing to share with you today. I apologize, and look forward to something more next week.</p>

<p>John Gruber with the one article you ought to read before Apple announces its new iPhones in a few weeks, and the single article you ought to read afterwards as well when searching for the reasons Apple chose these dimensions. Minus the somewhat unimaginative title, a great piece, albeit somewhat hard to follow at times given the complexity of the topic at hand and the factors playing into his assumptions.</p>

<p>Although I have never spent much time on Reddit, I once perused Digg with the same frequency that I opened Twitter and my RSS reader; sometimes, I even opted for the former in place of the latter. Similarly, I favored Hacker News over the more popular Techmeme for a time. In both cases though, despite all the enjoyment I found in these sites, I eventually abandoned each of them as the value they provided continued a disappointing slide towards zero. Today, Daring Fireball and The Loop are the closest things to a curation service that I continue visiting regularly, and one could certainly make an argument against their characterization as such.</p>

<p>Yet, even today, my refuges from the deluge of idiocy I find so prevalent on Reddit, less so on Digg, and only often enough on the remaining two to be annoying, even The Loop has begun that slide towards catering to the greatest common denominator in its paltry commentary and increasing reliance on third parties rather than original content to provide its users something new and interesting to read. Even as I criticize The Loop, Digg, and other, similar sites for falling from on high and following this trend downwards though, I must recognize the prudence of this move, for in doing so they have each perfected the curation model many consider so rare and elusive, and optimized it to such a degree so as to maximize its effectiveness. In short, for as much criticism as I and like-minded individuals particularly in the tech space like to lob at the Reddits of the world and, in my case, The Loops of the world, they have done exactly what we asked to the fullest extend possible.</p>

<p>I frequented Digg, Hacker News, and The Loop in search of interesting, thought-provoking pieces primarily written about subjects and industries related in some way to that of technology. Although there certainly is a market for such aggregators, it is nowhere near as large as the one for the incredibly broad category of enjoyable things. Moreover, the latter requires a great deal less effort to create, maintain, and run. So although Hacker News and The Loop have yet to devolve thusly, make no mistake: the temptation is there no matter how cleverly Digg may hide it behind an attractive coat of paint. And unfortunately, powerhouses in this space like Reddit and Buzzfeed have succumbed and made the tempting decision to use their power for evil instead of good&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least when viewed from this point of view, anyway.</p>

<p>Reddit and Digg are both &#8220;it&#8221;, those are the methods we search for in curation, except they curate the wrong topic for you and I who would read Hacker News; they work to a fault, showcasing cat pictures and memes because those are the things that, on average, the most people enjoy, the most people click on, and the most people share with others. It&#8217;s not that these machines are broken, then, as we might be want to portray them, but simply a result of the fact that these are the things that people are talking about.</p>

<p>It would not be altogether inappropriate to say that cat pictures are the third rail of the internet, the source of almost guaranteed popularity and, thus, revenue. However, unlike in politics, the act of touching this fluffy rail carries with it no significant consequences in this sector: they may lose the geeks, but they have a world to gain.</p>

<p><a href="http://benhewitt.net">Ben Hewitt</a> puts forth a very good case not seeking to argumentatively justify the notion of unschooling, but rather simply to explain his motivations behind choosing it for his two children in a fantastic article for Outside Online titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/Unschooling-The-Case-for-Setting-Your-Kids-Into-the-Wild.html">We Don&#8217;t Need no Education</a>&#8221;. As a homeschooler myself whose education resided somewhere between the traditional system and Ben&#8217;s approach on the spectrum of organized learning, I have been fortunate enough to both witness and experience many of the philosophies named here. Although this is neither the time nor place to discuss those observations, nor my broader thoughts on education vis-a-vis this article, keep this one in mind when I finally do sit down to talk about education.</p>

<p>Jeff Kish is a contributing editor for <a href="http://gearjunkie.com/">Gear Junkie</a>, a great site that publishes articles about the outdoors and the gear we humans can use to best tackle it. For the past two months, Jeff has been on a mission to hike the Pacific Northwest Trail, and post regular updates and gear reviews along the way. With this report, he has finally crossed the halfway point, and so I felt that now was as good a time as any to post a link here: if you, like me, appreciate a good trail almost as much as a great work of prose, I encourage you to give <a href="http://gearjunkie.com/PNT">this series</a> a look: it has both in good supply.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-08-25 07:59:48-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-08.html">08</a>/25 07:59:48 EST</time>
<p>Here on this website, I predominantly write about technology: Apple, iOS, the web, code, and the like in a mixture of original articles and link posts. I also put together a weekly collection of excellent podcasts that I, quite creatively, dubbed &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221;. Roughly once a month I write about cabins too, and every so often talk about outdoor gear. The vast majority of the pieces I publish here, however, are at least tangentially related to technology. So if today you have come here looking for one of these articles, perhaps one where I hypothesize as to the future of podcasts or Apple&#8217;s next operating system, you might as well leave now: today I will touch on none of those topics, for I have sat down to, for the first time in quite a while, talk about myself. Myself, and my future.</p>

<p>Looking back, the only job I remember wanting as a young man was that of an oceanographer circa the early 2000s. Somewhere between the ages of ten or twelve though, that changed. After that indeterminate point, I had no idea what I wanted for my future besides the general desire to enter a STEM-related field. Thus I made my way through the equivalent of junior high and then high school, not unlike a ship drifting down a large river without a captain at its helm: although I had no concrete goal at which to steer myself, nor even a particularly strong desire to navigate towards anything but the path of least resistance, at those ages my potential avenues of pursuit remained fairly restricted. I did well for myself, though, both academically and socially: I got good grades, tested well, and even met an amazing girl I&#8217;m lucky enough to still call my girlfriend after more than two years together.</p>

<p>Although around this time I had little to no idea as to what I wanted to do in the future, I did, however, begin to formulate a picture of what I did <em>not</em> want it to look like. For some reason, this took the form of a &#8220;bring your parent to school&#8221; day wherein my future son or daughter would trot me out in front of an expectant classroom, brimming with pride, only to have me try&#160;&#8212;&#160;and fail, more likely than not&#160;&#8212;&#160;to make a mundane desk job seem interesting, important, and cool. That&#8217;s not to say that I have anything against desk jobs, because I don&#8217;t&#160;&#8212;&#160;in fact, many of the most interesting people I know do their work by sitting at a desk for a large part of their day&#160;&#8212;&#160;, but that&#8217;s just not me: I have never wanted that sort of life for myself, and so if I can avoid it, I will.</p>

<p>It was in this all-around good standing, both socially and academically, and with little planned where my future was concerned, that I turned eighteen. After a year essentially spinning my wheels at an unchallenging online school though, devoting a great deal of time and effort to incredibly demanding extracurricular activities such as the FIRST Robotics Competition, and spending three months out of state and away from home, the realities of college and real, adult life hit me pretty hard: turns out I wasn&#8217;t ready to shoulder all of those burdens and responsibilities just yet, and so I did not. One of the many advantages of a homeschool education is the elasticity of grades: although at eighteen years of age convention dictates that I would have already finished my last year of high school and picked a college to attend, it was just as easy to turn the clocks back slightly so that I had my senior year left ahead of me. And so, come fall of 2013, rather than start my freshman year of college, I began taking classes from a local university for dual credit&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, credit towards both my high school and college degrees. This worked out remarkably well: I did excellent academically with a 4.0 GPA after two semesters, and got a taste of college life without all of the burdens and pressures that traditionally come with it. But although this approach positioned me very well to apply to college beginning in the Fall of 2014, it still left me with one large problem: paying for that education.</p>

<p>There has been a fair amount of discussion criticizing the academic machine lately, focused largely on increasing tuition rates even while the value of a degree continues to fall. Although I enjoy reading articles that dissect this, I have little interest in discussing it here: the way I see it, this perhaps exorbitant rate is the price of entering the workforce with a good chance at getting a good job so that I can possess the means to lead a fulfilling life down the road. Over-priced or not, this is the fee I must pay. As to how I would go about that, however, that has remained up in the air.</p>

<p>At first I placed my trust in my own achievements, relying on them to earn me either significant or numerous&#160;&#8212;&#160;or both&#160;&#8212;&#160;scholarships. Unfortunately, despite both a wide portfolio of extracurricular activities and a high school GPA of 3.99, those ended up netting me admittance but relatively little else. Framed in this way though, it sheds my next course of action in a rather negative light: scholarships were my plan A, and the next step was my plan B&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is the natural progression of these things, after all. But that&#8217;s not really how I saw it at all: I had two options, both equal in merit, and I chose one to start with because its barrier to entry, I felt, was much lower. I then followed it to its natural conclusion, and when it turned out all for naught, I shifted my focus to the other option. For me, that other option was the Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps, or the ROTC program.</p>

<p>Now, with the wisdom of hindsight, it is obvious to me that I should have applied to join Youngstown State University&#8217;s ROTC program in the first place. My dad served in the Army for twenty-four years, his father in the Navy before him, and my grandfather on my mom&#8217;s side spent several years in the Air Force; needless to say, I have a strong background in the various military branches, and it would not be wholly inappropriate to call me an army brat. I also love spending time outdoors, and as an Eagle Scout I have had many of the shared values between the Boy Scouts of America and the U.S. Army instilled within my already. Discipline, integrity, respect, physical fitness, and compassion, to name just a few. But instead I spent long, arduous hours filling out form after form, asking for recommendation letters, and writing small, inconsequential essays in pleas for $250 here, $1,000 there, and $300 somewhere else. I am grateful for each and every dollar I received in this way, but at tuition nearing $20,000 a year, each year for four years, I would have had to spend an eternity just in the application process. Regardless of how I got here though, I eventually made the right choice: at the end of May, I applied for a full four-year scholarship as part of YSU&#8217;s ROTC program. And then earlier this week, a scanned copy of a letter appeared in my inbox:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Szewczyk,</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased to inform you of your conditional selection to receive an Army ROTC 4-Year (4U) Scholarship...&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the elation and relief had faded, I began to think about how this would affect me and my future. For those unfamiliar with Army ROTC, it is a program administered by the U.S. Military through colleges and universities whereby students gain vital leadership and important life skills in a rigorous and disciplined setting. The program&#8217;s high school counterpart, JROTC, or Junior Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps, offers the same benefits except at a high school level. Contrary to popular belief, participation in either does not necessarily incur mandatory military service: students can enroll in JROTC throughout their high school career without entering the military at any point in their lives, and the same goes for college students except only for their freshman and sophomore years: after that, college students electing to continue on in their school&#8217;s ROTC program during their junior and senior years must serve in the military following their graduation.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting, in this brief aside turned lengthy explanation, that participating in either JROTC or ROTC at any point also does not guarantee that the student&#8217;s tuition fees in college will be paid: that is only the case for those selected for a two-, three-, or four-year scholarship. For these individuals, however, whereas their peers may enroll in ROTC as an elective and thus remain free of any obligation to serve after college, scholarship recipients must spend a minimum of eight years in military service following a graduation after four years. At this point you may have realize the purpose of this lengthy exposition: as a four-year scholarship recipient of Youngstown State University&#8217;s ROTC program, I now not only no longer have to worry about affording tuition, but also must spend a minimum of eight years serving in the United States Military upon graduation. &#8220;Must&#8221;, however, carries with it the improper connotations to convey how I feel towards this program and the mandatory service my participation in it, in this capacity, entails.</p>

<p>I was born on the military base Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and then spent the next sixteen years of my life moving, on average, once every two years: sometimes much, much more often than that, while at other times I went for long stretches of time in a single place. And I hated it: growing up, I found it incredibly hard to make friends and then leave them all behind one day, only to repeat the process again shortly thereafter. Looking back, though, I tend to romanticize the experiences I had and shed them in a slightly kinder light. They made me who I am today, after all, and for that I have no cause to feel anything but gratitude. The military has been an integral part of my life since I was born, then, and as of today, quite fittingly, will continue to play a pivotal role in it on into the future. As a result, I don&#8217;t consider this a forced conscription made out of obligation to the military for paying my way in college, but rather a unique privilege I have been given to not only serve in the world&#8217;s greatest military, but to give back to the institution that shaped me so significantly throughout my life as well. It is an honor and privilege to become a member of the United States Army, and today that honor and privilege is entirely mine.</p>

<p>My initial decision as well as the news I received today, then, both have and will continue to have a massive impact on my life going forward. At first, I expect this impact to remain relatively minor: I will shave slightly more often, maybe cut my hair a little shorter, wear different workout clothes when I go to the gym, and possibly go there more frequently; the time commitment in my freshman year is relatively minor. As time goes on, however, that influence and consequent demand on my time will grow, and that will change a lot of things: it will change how often and when I get to spend time with my girlfriend, what I do in my free time, the Scouting activities I can participate in, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;likely most important to you, my dear reader&#160;&#8212;&#160;will almost certainly change our relationship as well as my relationship to not only technology, but this entire industry. I still take great interest in everything technology touches, and I still have a passion for this niche I have carved out in the Apple blogosphere that you so generously inhabit alongside me. But that said, my priorities will begin to shift, because they must. They will shift almost imperceptibly at first, but then undoubtedly pick up speed as time goes on.</p>

<p>I sat down to pen this article today not to declare my impending exit from this space, though, but simply to give you a heads up: here is what is going on in my life right now, and this is how it will change the relationship between us that I have come to value so greatly over the last two years during which I have written here. If I do end up going AWOL&#160;&#8212;&#160;from this site, I mean&#160;&#8212;&#160;I want you to know why I did so. Because I have a great deal of appreciation for those of you who have stuck with me over the years, and also a great deal of respect. We are cut of the same mold, you and I, and the friendships this site has spawned are something I hope to never lose no matter where I go or what I end up doing. My focus may shift until this site and the writer&#8217;s craft I have come to love are no longer squarely in its center, but these will never fully leave me. And in <a href="http://youtu.be/NJhtTYfXVyk">the words of Bryan Adams</a>, &#8220;I will always, always return.&#8221;</p>

<p>An unfortunately short list for you this week, curiously, despite the fact that&#160;&#8212;&#160;given my two-week absence&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have no shortage of podcasts queued up awaiting a bit of free time. But, therein lies the problem: as school resumes, I will no longer have the eight hours a day, forty hours each week, that I did over the summer to devote to podcasts. But enough about me&#160;&#8212;&#160;on to the shows you came here to hear about:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecampfireproject.com/episodes/022">The Campfire Project Episode 22: Press X To Continue</a>. I tend to stay away from video game-centric podcasts: despite my like of Federico Viticci and Myke Hurley, I did not subscribe to Directional nor did I to the show&#8217;s second incarnation, <a href="http://relay.fm/virtual">Virtual</a>. I chose not to subscribe not necessarily out of a dislike of the video game medium, but more so because I have done so little in this genre to such an extent that I have next to no frame of reference with which to process their discussions. Put simply, I have no overlap with those who love talking about this subject. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this episode of The Campfire Project, where Matt Dusenbury and Chris Domico focused more on the story side of gaming and talked a great deal about my favorite type of video game, first-person shooters.</p>

<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/77">ATP Episode 77: Full-Stack Businessperson</a>. Creativity and its associated difficulties have experienced <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-be-creative.html">a surge in popularity</a> lately, especially amongst those who love to explain why they cannot make cool and interesting things rather than buckling down to do the hard work that needs done. Alongside these embittered discussions, another thread has sought to explain a lack of success amongst those who feel they have put in enough time and effort to deserve it, but nevertheless have yet to experience the fruits of their labors. Just as is the case with the former, I feel it is a fool&#8217;s errand to spend any significant amount of time on the latter: perhaps rather than an issue inherent and eminently unsolvable in the industry as many like to paint the App Store revenue debate, the problem may instead lie in <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExploringImpostorSyndromeInTechnologySXSW15.aspx">our species&#8217; innate inability to realize our own shortcomings</a>, particularly apparent in unskilled workers who do not recognize their lack of skill. That is to say, unfortunately, your work may not be as spectacular as you believe. In this episode of The Accidental Tech Podcast, John relates these complicated factors to the recent discussion on the viability of building a business on the App Store. Also on the docket, the true challenge of going independent versus taking a corporate job, and how your inability to make a living doing what you love might not mean that doing so is impossible, but rather than you ought to change your expectations in accordance with this new lifestyle.</p>

<p>A pragmatic approach to something I one day hope to undertake myself: building my own cabin out in the woods. I fully a knowledge that I do not yet have all the experience necessary to do this well, to say nothing for the money, but all in due time.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-08-22 12:22:54-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-08.html">08</a>/22 12:22:54 EST</time>
<p>Shortly after <a href="http://5by5.tv/amplified">Amplified</a> started in 2012, I began following The Loop back when Jim Dalrymple served as the site&#8217;s sole writer. With a great sense of humor and an attractive approach to journalism that made no bones about calling people, institutions, and companies out for their often ridiculous shortcomings, the fact that Jim wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/an-amalgamation-of-reviews.html">great hardware reviews</a> after Apple events was more a cherry atop the sundae than a driving motivation behind my choice to follow him; before too long, he had become one of my favorite writers, and his site the one location I turned to for a more diverse set of news stories than we in the insular tech community often expose ourselves to.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today and The Loop has grown tremendously in the two years since Amplified began, inarguably due in no small part to the podcast&#8217;s impressive success. Along with that increase in readership, revenue has grown, but also the expectation that The Loop&#8217;s staff maintain an ever-increasing rate of publication so as to keep up with other, similar sites in possession of larger writing staffs. Pageviews mean dollars in this business, and the best way to increase both is to constantly provide readers with something new and interesting to read. Pursuant of that goal, The Loop now employs three writers: Jim Dalrymple still publishes an article or two occasionally, although he has done so less often as of late; Dave Mark and Shawn King have out-posted Jim for quite some time now.</p>

<p>At first glance, one might consider this an obvious indication of well-deserved success&#160;&#8212;&#160;and indeed, it was in this light that I saw The Loop until only recently; within the last week or two though, as I scrolled through several hundred articles from my two-week &#8220;vacation&#8221; to Canada&#8217;s wilderness, it felt almost as if a veil had lifted from my eyes as I began to question the value added when linking to an article with nothing more than, &#8220;<a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/15/tips-from-25-guitarists-on-playing-better/">There are some great tips in here.</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/17/i-went-undercover-in-americas-toughest-prison/">I don&#8217;t know if the author is brave or stupid. Undoubtedly, a lot of both.</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not mean to sit here and paint every article from The Loop with the same brush, because doing so would do a severe disservice to all the interesting articles that appear there alongside worthwhile commentary that actually adds value to the larger narrative at hand. Consider, as examples of this dichotomy, two other posts from the same time period as those cited above, <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/16/humans-need-not-apply/">Humans need not apply</a> and <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/16/hyperlapse/">Hyperlapse</a>: both very interesting pieces in and of themselves, whose relevancy is further augmented by the succinct commentary that appears alongside them. This is great linkblogging done right; the other, not so much.</p>

<p>Of course, in the face of this metered condemnation one could make the usual case for linkblogs, arguing that their function is not intended to be a source of primary content but rather to act as a referral for others to discover new and interesting work that might otherwise go unnoticed. And just as that argument has merit when justifying the existence of linkblogs, so, too, does it maintain its relevancy here. However, in a day and age where it has become increasingly easy to set up a site on Tumblr or Squarespace, troll The Verge, and provide a passable facsimile of the work shops like The Loop have begun churning out recently in order to maintain a breakneck pace, we find ourselves saddled with the ever-relevant question of differentiation: what differentiates me from John Gruber from any one of the thousands of WordPress sites created every day? As I have stated before in one of the most oft-referenced articles I have ever written, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/owning-their-words.html">Owning Their Words</a>, there is but one thing that we each possess that no one else in the world does: our voice. I have a different voice than John Gruber who has a different voice than that of any one of the thousands of WordPress sites created every day. Ultimately, that voice is what leads to success&#160;&#8212;&#160;it precludes it, in fact, for without the ability to quantify that voice our work is doomed to fade into oblivion, as is the case for the vast majority of sites and writers who endeavor to make a go at this craft.</p>

<p>I sit down to write this today, then, not to pillory Jim and his compatriots for any shortcoming, perceived or otherwise, on their site, but rather in the hopes of offering a bit of constructive criticism: it seems that as of late, the voice that made me and undoubtedly so many others jump on The Loop&#8217;s bandwagon has taken a back seat to what I and I would wager many others consider the ancillary content&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely, the work of others. There is a reason I do not follow The Verge, Bloomberg, or any other big news site, after all, and a reason that I follow groups of independent writers like The Loop instead. Or at least, there used to be a reason; lately, it has begun to fade. Here&#8217;s to bringing it back.</p>

<p>Very interesting point from Benedict Evans at the tail end of this article, where he points out that Apple&#8217;s <em>decision</em> not to build a larger phone, and the company&#8217;s decision not to enter the mid- to low-end, place it in a very powerful position going forward as those decisions can be reversed at any time. Much more powerful a position than its competitors, because unlike Apple who possess the ability to ship phones with these capabilities but has thus far deigned not to, others have proven wholly incapable of creating the aspects that make Apple&#8217;s products so valuable. Going forward, that ought to cause a great deal of concern amongst some, while a great deal of hope among others.</p>

<p>I tweeted a link to this piece right before I left for Canada, but it bears repeating once more in a more formal fashion here: on August 1st, Linus Edwards made a brief reappearance on VintageZen with another installment in his ongoing article series, this time titled <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/8/1/dz17">The Daily Zen #17 &#8220;how to be Creative in One Simple Step&#8221;</a>. If you, like me, have become disillusioned with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-creativity-racket.html">the creativity racket</a>, and especially if you have <em>not</em> yet realized this, I highly recommend this short piece: Linus makes a great case, and has a fantastic conclusion.</p>

<p>Plus, as a expletive-filled bonus at the bottom of his post, commenter Dain Miller leveled a criticism not overdue for Linus in particular, but more so the entire faction of writers who love to wax on explaining how difficult writing has become. I will not be so foolish as to deny the difficulty of writing, but I will say that I agree wholly with Dain&#8217;s statement: &#8220;I&#8217;m so sick of people not doing their blogs anymore &#8216;because they don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;. &#8216;It got hard&#8217; wah wah wah. Fucking christ dude, man the fuck up and do your work. If your goals are really the goals you said they are, or you want to accomplish was what you claimed you did - you wouldn&#8217;t let &#8216;something being inconvenient or a chore&#8217; fucking stop you.&#8221; I 100%, completely, totally, and unequivocally agree.</p>

<p>No really, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called: shortly after World War II, Erhard and Sons began manufacturing Albert Friedrich&#8217;s vehicle for primarily agricultural use in post-war Germany until Mercedes-Benz took over the production process in the early 1950s. Since then, the Unimog has fostered quite the fanatical fan base, not unlike that of its <a href="http://silodrome.com/unimog-mercedes-benz/">counterparts</a> across the world, the American Jeep, British Land Rover, or Japanese Land Cruiser. And looking at it, and <a href="http://youtu.be/INxkz6UcNoE">seeing just what this family can really do</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise: this is one remarkably capable vehicle any outdoor enthusiast would be truly fortunate to have in their arsenal.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-08-17 21:21:34-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-08.html">08</a>/17 21:21:34 EST</time>
<p>I have decided to publish this a day early this week, as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/leave-of-absence.html">I leave for Canada</a> in just a few hours and waiting any longer would make this impossible. Until I return on the sixteenth, then, enjoy this final installment of my ongoing series, This Week in Podcasts. I look forward to coming home and finding a host of shows awaiting my arrival almost as much as I anticipate writing this piece&#8217;s successor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zombiepodcast.com">We&#8217;re Alive</a>. Although I included a link to this fantastic show in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-72014.html">last week&#8217;s article</a>, I feel compelled to bring it up here once again because it has by far and away dominated my listening time over the past week. So much so, in fact, that I have had to forcefully tear myself away in order to listen to some of my favorite shows&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that&#8217;s really saying something.</p>

<p>The appeal of We&#8217;re Alive isn&#8217;t that of a zombie show, because I dislike the genre a great deal; rather, the appeal of We&#8217;re Alive is its place as a fictitious piece speculating as to humanity&#8217;s true nature and most base urges at the time of great trial. That&#8217;s why I find this show so interesting, and have come to enjoy listening to it so much. For the zombie fans out there and those who&#160;&#8212;&#160;like me&#160;&#8212;&#160;avoid the genre altogether alike, I highly recommend this show. Come for the zombies, but stay for the hard look at humanity in both its finest and poorest moments.</p>

<p><a href="http://recess.unitedpixelworkers.com">Pixel Recess</a>. Another show from last week, but again&#160;&#8212;&#160;I just can&#8217;t help but bring it up once more: at less than ten minutes per episode, I listen to these in batches of five or more at a time. Because of that, and because it&#8217;s just so good and remarkably funny, there would be too many to list individually. So just once more, let me offer this up as a recommendation to anyone looking for&#160;&#8212;&#160;as it was described to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;a more design-y version of Bionic&#8221;. If that description alone doesn&#8217;t make you want to listen, give an episode or two a shot: you can afford the time investiture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-43-exclusive-marco-arment-breaks-his-silence-overcast">Debug Episode 43: Exclusive: Marco Arment breaks his silence on Overcast!</a>. Guy English and Rene Richie had Marco Arment on to talk about Overcast and, by extension, the podcast industry at large and some of the challenges this medium faces going forward. I found the numerous other shows Marco has already done talking about Overcast interesting, but this one was by far the best: he dove right in to the nitty-gritty details of his decision-making process when it came to almost every aspect of his new app, and his insights into the current state of podcasts were very interesting. On top of those though, as if those two topics alone could not stand on their own, the trio also discussed the challenges of and possible solutions to breaking into the software industry, and how the best way to get noticed is to do great work.</p>

<p>Once again, I&#8217;m back with some stellar cabins from around the world. This time, however, unlike past articles in this series and <a href="https://twitter.com/Gianlovessurf/status/484445366302281728">upon request by Gianfranco Lanzio</a>, I have bundled images alongside the appropriate paragraphs in an effort at more easily conveying the beauty of these structures and their accompanying sceneries. I hope you all like the result just as much as I do, and maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;even more.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Silos-Summer.jpg' alt='The Nicest Grain Silo You've Ever Slept In' title='The Nicest Grain Silo You've Ever Slept In' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Traveling the country has been a goal of mine for quite some time now, due in no small part to a desire to discover neat places like <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/escapes/base-camp/The-Nicest-Grain-Silo-Youve-Ever-Slept-In.html">this grain silo turned bed and breakfast</a> out in Oregon. I would love to spend a few days here, especially given that it remains a fully-functioning farm. Very cool.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/New-Brunswick-Canada.jpg' alt='Off-the-grid cabin, St. Francis River, New Brunswick, Canada.' title='Off-the-grid cabin, St. Francis River, New Brunswick, Canada' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Even nicer than <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90556105592/off-the-grid-cabin-st-francis-river-new">this little cabin in the woods of New Brunswick, Canada</a>, is the story its creator tells in reference to it: built in 1969 at the age of 26, Stephen Spang continues to return here to this day. Since I started putting these shorts posts together a year or so ago, I have found this often the case: the stories behind these cabins often trump the aesthetics of both the cabins themselves and their surroundings as well.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Starra-Lubovna-Slovakia.jpg' alt='Cottage 20 minutes outside Stara Lubovna, Slovakia.' title='Cottage 20 minutes outside Stara Lubovna, Slovakia.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90657516513/cottage-20-minutes-outside-stara-lubovna">This cottage</a> has a little bit of every one of my favorite things going for it: set in a quiet meadow, backed by a dense copse of pine trees, and shrouded in mist, I would love to take the photographer&#8217;s place and spend a while enjoying this picturesque scene; and if you&#8217;re in the mood for some more fantastic photography, <a href="http://frombusytoeasy.blogspot.sk">give their blog a shot</a>: Danka and Peter take some fantastic pictures.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Leon-Spain.jpg' alt='Caba&ntilde;a el Frade near Leon, Spain.' title='Caba&ntilde;a el Frade near Leon, Spain.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I could almost swear that I have seen <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90691568405/cabana-el-frade-near-leon-spain-contributed-by">this very cabin</a> somewhere else before, but I cannot for the life of my remember where. Regardless, it certainly deserves a mention here, especially when framed by such majestic mountains. Beautiful.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/White_Sea_Russia.jpg' alt='Cabin far in the forests of White Sea, Russia.' title='Cabin far in the forests of White Sea, Russia.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Russia has always been, and will unfortunately likely remain so for the foreseeable future, a black box of sorts: I will readily admit that I do not know a great deal about most countries in the world, but I know next to nothing about Russia with the exception of the vestigial horror stories leftover after the Cold War. Yet, the country still has cabins like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/91205474550/cabin-far-in-the-forests-of-white-sea-russia">this one</a> on the shore of the White Sea. And to me, that&#8217;s very cool.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Alfred-New-York.jpg' alt='Cabin in Alfred, New York.' title='Cabin in Alfred, New York.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I have traveled a great deal in my lifetime, but have never made it any further west than Wisconsin, and despite visiting many states on and around the east coast, have yet to travel any further north than Pennsylvania. On my someday-maybe list is New York, for precisely this reason: not just to see the city, but to visit the beautiful countryside of upstate New York such as the area <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/91453391635/cabin-in-alfred-new-york-contributed-by-graham">this cabin</a> is set in as well. I would love to spend some time trekking through these woods.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/burntside-lodge-minnesota-lake_h.jpg' alt='An Old-School Northwoods Outfit' title='An Old-School Northwoods Outfit' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I spent a week in northern Minnesota at a friend&#8217;s cabin once, and ever since then I have wanted to go back: it&#8217;s just such a cool, interesting, and fun part of the country. Now, there certainly is something to be said for roughing it in a rustic cabin or out tent camping in the middle of the woods, but for everyone else that wants to experience what quickly became one of my favorite places in the country, there&#8217;s always <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/escapes/base-camp/An-Old-School-North-Woods-Outfit.html">the Burntside Lodge</a>. As much as I love primitive camping, even I could spend some time here. It would be rough, but someone has to do it.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Lake-St-Clair-Tasmania.jpg' alt='Kitchen Hut on Cradle Mountain, Lake St. Clair National Park, Tasmania.' title='Kitchen Hut on Cradle Mountain, Lake St. Clair National Park, Tasmania.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>A <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/92145389548/kitchen-hut-on-cradle-mountain-lake-st-clair">quaint cabin</a> in Lake St. Clair National Park, Tasmania. Off in the distance, you can just make out the valley below Cradle Mountain through the mist; what a view that must be.</p>

<p>Excellent article from Carl Holscher on what it actually means to be an adult. At nineteen and preparing to head off to college, as well as greater things hopefully down the road, I found this piece particularly interesting and profound.</p>

<p>As I sit down to begin writing this, I lay in a hammock strung between two trees. It is old, this hammock: the previous owners replaced an even older one with it as a small gift when my family purchased this house some three years ago now, and despite the occasional frayed rope, we have felt no need to replace it yet. Outside of the occasional creak and a fair bit of moss that has worked its way into the fibrous sinews that crisscross seemingly haphazardly below my feet, down under my back, and up behind my head, this woven sling works just as well as it did the day I first sat upon it. More importantly though, it has become a fixture as a part of this small slice of nature as the trees that form the canopy above me.</p>

<p>Off to my left and a few yards into the woods, a tree stump nearly two feet wide sticks out of the ground. At one point, a sapling grew here; at another, a tree. By the time I had come upon this tree, however, it&#8217;s life had begun to flee from its limbs not unlike its own leaves did every autumn. Unlike its leaves though, this life would never return. And so I found this tree, dying a slow and silent death; and thus I decided, one day, to chop it down.</p>

<p>I walked out of my garage with a splitting axe in hand, because I did not yet have a chopping axe, but mostly out of ignorance: this heavy, sledgehammer of a tool was all that I knew to use. I crossed my yard with expectant determination, with my task laid out before me and towering some thirty feet above my head.</p>

<p>My first strike hit hard; the wide, flayed blade of my splitting axe, designed to split logs rather than fell trees, bit in, and bit deep. My next strike, the same. Gradually, as time ticked by, a pile of wood chips built up around my feet, interspersed with drops of sweat but&#160;&#8212;&#160;thankfully&#160;&#8212;&#160;no blood. I had no intention of pouring any blood or tears into this project.</p>

<p>Even if pressed today, I could not say how long it took me to chop through that tree. Minutes&#160;&#8212;&#160;unlikely; hours, perhaps, but as to how many, I could not say. I did succeed, though: that tree did fall.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>How many people do you know that have ever swung an axe? Or, perhaps more appropriately given our day and age, how many people do you know that could start a chainsaw, much less use one effectively? Do not take my words as those of a crass braggart, seeking so desperately to set himself apart from others so as to point out their flaws in areas where he excels; I do have a point to make, and so in service of that, allow me to continue.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>One Spring a number of years ago, at a house whose every room I still see with remarkable clarity given how briefly I lived there, my dad decided to put in a garden. Behind the sprawling ranch-style house, between a row of apple and pear trees on the left and a pond on the right, a sizable stretch of open grass extended from our back porch out until it ended rather abruptly at a wood line. With near-constant exposure to the sun and good irrigation down a slight decline towards the pond, it seemed like the perfect spot. Out of everything that we planted there though, the only produce I ever remember harvesting were potatoes, and I only recall doing that once. It strikes me as rather strange, then, that given an apparent lack of agricultural ability and drive to continue this admittedly difficult pursuit, that we planted such a large garden.</p>

<p>Looking back, this could not have been my family&#8217;s first foray into small-scale farming, because when he turned the soil in preparation of planting this garden, my dad used a tractor to do it. I could not say where it came from or how it even got there, but I remember sitting under a large oak tree watching him drive the large blue machine back and forth, digging deep furrows into the soft soil with each pass. After he finished, I raced my friend back and forth across that field until we could go no longer; and once we had finished, we had left our own set of footprint furrows crossing the machine-made ones in two wavy lines. &#8220;Break up the chunks&#8221;, my dad had said, and so we had.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, we watered and weeded the garden with regularity. However, for me to claim a large role in this process would be to tell a great lie, for I hardly remember anything about that summer except running around in the woods. Given the chance now, I hope I would pay this plot of land a great deal more attention than I did at the time. Nevertheless, despite my role as an absentee farmer, this patch of tilled soil did yield a crop of potatoes, at least. I feel confident in saying that it also produced other vegetables, but as to what types, I could not say with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>I remember kneeling in the dirt, loosening the soil around each plant&#8217;s stem, and unearthing ball after ball of white and brown potato; I tried wiping the dirt off with my hand, but it did not take long for this to spread more dirt than it removed. Before long, I began tossing these small bundles into a bucket as fast as I could pull them out of the ground.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>Sitting here today, I cannot point to one single event as the genesis for my long-standing desire to have a farm. Perhaps it came about as a result of this experience, or maybe after a different encounter in another place at another time. For as long as I can remember, my aunt and uncle have lived on a farm; perhaps observing their lifestyle instilled within me a desire to emulate it. Regardless, the idea that one could increase one&#8217;s independence in this way to the point of complete self-reliance has fascinated me for a great while. And for a time, this was universally the case: America only recently shifted from an agrarian society to one based around cities and suburbs; prior to that shift, everyone shared the same attraction to self-reliance that farming offered. Yet despite the recency of this transition, how many people these days can plant a garden? How many can grow something? Perhaps more saliently, how many would even want to?</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>When I look back upon the five years since I joined the Boy Scouts of America, one backpacking trip stands out as the bar against which all other such adventures must be measured. In order to fully understand the significance of that excursion, however, I must explain its predecessor.</p>

<p>Shortly after I joined Troop 224 in Pembroke Pines, Florida, at the age of fourteen, my troop once again attempted to complete a 50 mile hike. Spread over a week and consisting of any combination of hiking, cycling, and canoeing, my troop had attempted this feat a number of times in the past to unsuccessful results. This time, however, by hiking with only light daypacks rather than fully-packed backpacks, and canoeing for a fair portion of the required distance, we managed to cover the necessary miles within our allotted time. Although I considered this a great accomplishment at the time, time&#8217;s inexorable march and the remove it afforded me from this event gradually allowed me to see that while we had technically met the activity&#8217;s requirements, our chosen course of action did not live up to my high expectations for a trip that ought to have been much more difficult. Even today, while I still feel proud to have accomplished this, I cannot, in good conscience, paint it as the strenuous physical trial that it was created to be. For this reason, and due to my love of hiking I discovered during my early years in Scouts, I agreed to go on another 50 mile hike a number of years later with my cousin&#8217;s troop.</p>

<p>Unlike my previous trip over the flatlands of Florida, this hike would take place in the mountains of Pennsylvania and Ohio, along a portion of the Appalachian Trail; whereas previously we were given the option to abstain from hiking every morning before leaving the base camp, this time around we planned to start in Pennsylvania&#8217;s Laurel Highlands and camp somewhere along the trail at a different location every single night; unlike my Florida attempt, this trip would consist solely of hiking. Most importantly though, each and every one of us had to carry everything we needed for an entire week, including food, on our backs the entire time. We had the opportunity to refill our water bottles almost every night, but with that exception we were forced to become completely self-reliant as soon as we stepped out of our cars that Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>In short, I had a blast. We walked up and down mountains, through forests, and even under a freeway for an entire week; I hated every step of it, and I loved this trip like I have no other both before or since. It was incredible, and full of experiences I will remember for the rest of my life. This is the outing to which I compare all other &#8220;backpacking&#8221; trips, and the reason that, in my mind, I have only ever gone on one: after a week on the Appalachian Trail, what could possibly compare? In my experience, very little.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>The appeal of backpacking&#160;&#8212;&#160;for me personally, anyway&#160;&#8212;&#160;lies in its unique combination of demands requiring complete self-reliance, and offering in exchange something, unfortunately, much less tangible: that indescribable, triumphant feeling brought on at the top of a mountain when I can look for miles in every direction; the sense of awe when I come across an abandoned Firetower, climb to the top, and stand hundreds of feet in the air watching an Eagle fly by my window. These feelings, these senses, border on indescribable, and yet I have still endeavored to label them with a mixture of plain and flowery words in the hopes that by doing so you may grasp even a tenth of the wonder that this experience can inspire given the chance. And for those of you reading this, that is all fine and well: should these words implant within you this thirst for adventure, I will count this entire endeavor a success. But for everyone else, all those who will never read this and never spend enough time outdoors to take a hike, how many will ever experience these wondrous, formative events? My bet: all too few, and <a href="http://gearjunkie.com/backpacking-participation-is-dying">fewer every single day</a>.</p>

<p>I started to write this partly put of nostalgia, for experiences I fear I and my successors may never have again as the desire to step outside, strap a pack on, chop a tree down, or even take on something so simple as planting a garden fade into oblivion; I wrote this because I feel as if I am the last of a dying breed, of a strain that reveled in hard work and getting their hands dirty. How many of my generation will ever even possess these desires, much less act on them? And that&#8217;s to say nothing of our successors, who have grown up and will continue to develop engrossed in artificial worlds thanks to the meteoric rise of personal computers over the last twenty or so years.</p>

<p>I spent the first twelve years of my life digging holes in the ground, climbing trees, and fishing every chance I could; my neighbor&#8217;s three sons can barely tear themselves away from Call of Duty long enough to play in their back yard. I played my fair share of video games, don&#8217;t get me wrong&#160;&#8212;&#160;ATV Off-road Fury 2 with my cousin, Super Smash Bros Melee and Toy Commander with my friends, and I spent hours tapping away at my GameBoy Advance successfully beating Pokemon numerous times&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I dreamed of being outside; I lived for it: for the long summer days in the woods, the cool fall evenings beside a bonfire, and those cold winter days trudging back up a long hill with a sled in tow. I enjoyed those digital distractions, but my true passion lay and continues to lie elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was able to weigh the benefits of both lifestyles at an early age and make an informed decision as to how I wished to live my life. And looking back on these nineteen years I have spent on this earth, I believe I chose correctly: my carpentry skills far surpass that of my ability to Minecraft, and thus far that disparity has served me remarkably well.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to sit here proclaiming that everyone should abandon their iPads at the altar of Mother Earth, but I do believe there is something to be said for trying another lifestyle before defaulting into the easy societal norm. If not for you, do it for your kids: only so many can live their entire lives tapping away at a keyboard, and only a small subset of those can lead a fulfilling life doing so. It never hurts to have a backup plan, and as sad as it makes me to cast the earth and all its majesty in such a light, that is the unfortunate place we have come to.</p>

<p>Spend some time outside; exercise; try something new; challenge yourself. I promise, you will not regret it&#160;&#8212;&#160;and maybe, someday, you just might be glad that you did. I know I am.</p>

<p>The best way to attain success is to show up every single day and work hard, or so the saying goes; in terms of this site and my goal of growing and fostering a strong readership, this meant putting some nontrivial amount of time into reading and writing every single day in the hopes that I could one day make this more than a hobby. For quite some time now, I have done well to follow this advice, and doing so has led to rather spectacular results: although this is not the time nor place to delve into specifics, suffice it to say that this has been a fantastic year so far. Yet, despite this track record, I am about to break this cardinal rule because for the next two weeks starting Saturday, April 2nd, I will neither read nor write a single thing.</p>

<p>Come Saturday morning, the sun will rise to see me on the road to Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada, for a canoe trip consisting of two parts: for the first week, my group of twelve will paddle throughout the park going from campsite to campsite, exploring the Canadian wilderness until our return to base camp the following Saturday. Upon our arrival though, the trip is only half finished: we will then spend the next week with thirty-eight additional members of my Boy Scouts troop doing activities in and around a base camp. As I have never gone on this trip before, I cannot say for sure what, specifically, our activities will consist of; however, regardless of whether I spend my days hiking through the woods or laying in a hammock, I will have no internet access throughout the duration of my trip. And so, obviously, I will neither have the ability&#160;&#8212;&#160;nor desire, quite frankly&#160;&#8212;&#160;to read and write much of anything but the occasional journal entry, perhaps; and so, this is one of the last articles I will publish for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Until I return, find another writer to follow for a time; I hope that once I do, though, you will come back here. Until then, goodbye; until then, good luck as well.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-31 16:27:19-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/31 16:27:19 EST</time>
<p>Another great piece from the surprisingly diverse site Outside Online, this time on the hallowed 10,000 hour rule. Especially within the circles I travel of writers, programmers, and general creative types, this is a very popular way for many to prescribe greater dedication and hard work to those looking to attain some modicum of success. However, even in the face of these new findings, I believe the underlying sentiment behind these suggestions prompted by this veneered rule remain valid: there is still something to be said for showing up every day, and in the creative professions, raw talent is but a small and potentially insignificant ingredient leading to eventual success.</p>

<p>Discovered thanks to Dave Pell&#8217;s excellent newsletter The Next Draft under the title &#8220;<a href="http://nextdraft.com/archives/n20140728/just-look-at-yourself/">Just Look at Yourself</a>&#8221;, this is a very fascinating realization that immediately resonated with me: perhaps one of the reasons so many people spend such vast amounts of time engrossed in one device or another is not necessarily because Candy Crush is so addicting and Facebook makes them feel happy&#160;&#8212;&#160;or sad, as the case may be&#160;&#8212;&#160;, but rather because we have developed an intense dislike of introspection and the discomforts it almost invariably brings along with it. Reading that, it felt as if a puzzle piece had clicked into place: <em>&#8220;Yes, it all makes sense.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>I wake up every morning, and within fifteen minutes of getting out of bed I walk into the gym where I spend the next hour working out. After that, I have between thirty minutes and an hour before I have to leave for work, during which I prepare for my day and, if I have time, read and do a little bit of writing. As I find it difficult to read or write while listening to music, I generally keep iTunes closed when engaged in one of those two activities; otherwise though, I keep something playing almost constantly.</p>

<p>Every day at work, I keep one earbud in at all times through which I listen to podcasts for nearly eight hours every day. Painting can be a quiet, lonely, and somewhat tedious task at times; this helps me stay focused and engaged. Both to and from work at the beginning and end of the day, I continue listening to those podcasts in the car until I get home, where the same rule set that determines what I listen to in the morning once again informs whether I listen to a song, podcast, or merely the sound of my finders tapping away at the keyboard. Regardless though, here once again, just as I do throughout the rest of my day, I permit myself no silence whatsoever. Even when lying in bed at the end of the day, I turn to a past episode of one of my favorite podcasts to help put me to sleep.</p>

<p>I routinely go an entire day without any time for quiet introspection. While I once considered this simply an efficient use of my time&#160;&#8212;&#160;why drive in silence when I can listen to a podcast or two?&#160;&#8212;&#160;, I now recognize this common happenstance as the habit it has become: filling every available second with an activity has ceased to serve as a means to the end of greater productivity in a given twenty-four hour timespan, and now functions merely as an excuse for me to avoid any time alone with my thoughts.</p>

<p>As for the future, I cannot say for sure where I will go from here. This is a very interesting realization, and also a potentially very important one as well. For now though, I plan to start by sitting alone with my thoughts before bed; in a week or two, who knows?</p>

My only complaint is that I wish it were longer: 50 Cent had some fantastic advice and shared a number of very interesting insights that I wish GQ had given Zach more time to expand upon, and perhaps even search for more of; fascinating and highly-recommended.</p>

<p>A more apropos title, I feel, might read something along the lines of &#8220;Entitlement in the Age of Abundance&#8221;. Between that, and Ben&#8217;s actual title, I&#8217;m sure you can get a fair idea as to the subject matter of his article. And his closing point: the cliched &#8220;you never know what you&#8217;ve got &#8217;till it&#8217;s gone&#8221;. I find it remarkable how many love to hate companies like Google, yet have no problem crawling back to them when they finally realize how instrumental the &#8220;evil overlord&#8221; was to their daily operations. Whether an individual whining about the company&#8217;s privacy practices or, as is the case here, a publisher acting on a misplaced sense of entitlement, the outcome is the same.</p>

<p>Stick to your high-brow morals if you must, but if you must, actually stick to them.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I harbor a strong dislike of The Verge: perpetually vying with public radio for the title of my most hated news institution, I make no bones about <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/492809842709782528">sharing</a> this <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/491710620749012992">disgust</a> with others. And so, because of that, when the news first broke that Josh Topolsky&#160;&#8212;&#160;a writer I have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html">no great love for</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;was leaving Vox for Bloomberg, I barely took notice; however, a lot of other people have, and this has since become quite the news story for many. To each their own, I suppose.</p>

<p>Until this morning, I had not planned to write anything about this event: I just <em>don&#8217;t care</em>. But then Daniel Ignacio <a href="https://twitter.com/dotdapple/status/493281692048576512">sent me a link</a> to a conversation between him and Mathew Conto, and I just couldn&#8217;t resist <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Iq9HJ/">sharing the link here</a>: this is everything you need to know about The Verge and Josh Topolsky&#8217;s move both. Welcome to The Precipice.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-27 09:12:41-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/27 09:12:41 EST</time>
<p>This week, thanks to Carl Holscher and Daniel Ignacio, I have discovered two great new podcasts. Alongside these two shows, I once again present my list of the best podcasts I have had the privilege to hear over the past seven days. These are the best of the best, folks, and as such I hope you will spend some time checkout out each and every one of them. I promise: it will be worth your time.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/11/19/67-what-does-a-grown-man-look-like-naked-scott-simpson">Unprofessional Episode 67: What Does a Grown Man Look Like Naked &#160;&#8212;&#160; Scott Simpson</a>. Airborne turbulence, damaging accusations, awkward situations at your kid&#8217;s birthday party, and what to do when you think your plane might crash. As is the case with almost every podcast Scott Simpson makes an appearance on, this was both <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/smart-and-funny.html">smart and quite funny</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/12/3/69-anastasia-helicopter-merlin-mann">Unprofessional Episode 69: Anastasia Helicopter &#160;&#8212;&#160; Merlin Mann</a>. Turns out names are hard, and words are even harder: in this week&#8217;s episode of Unprofessional, Dave, Lex, and Merlin pillory the terrible choices so many make in naming their children.</p>

<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/75">Accidental Tech Podcast Episode 75: You Had Your Moment</a>. Turns out John hates amusement parks. This week&#8217;s intro right here is 3:25 of John Siracusa at his best; absolutely hilarious. Also on this episode, the importance of self-relience when insuring the longevity of your creations, more Overcast follow-up, and some additional speculation as to the material of the purported iPhone 6 screen that leaked some two weeks ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-010-clap-on-three/">Exponent Episode 10: Clap on Three</a>. Ben and James talk once again on economics and Uber, a topic I found fascinating <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-6714.html">last time they went over it</a>, and have another great discussion about culture as it relates to Microsoft and the company&#8217;s future. Unsurprisingly, a very interesting episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zombiepodcast.com">We&#8217;re Alive</a>. After a <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/491710615359348736">desperate plea for suggestions</a>, Carl Holscher pointed me towards this podcast. Although I tend to dislike the zombie genre, I decided to give it a try; fifteen chapters over some forty-eight episodes later, and I&#8217;m hooked: We&#8217;re Alive is a fantastic radio drama the likes of which I have never heard before. I will admit that at times the producers get a little too ambitious and have too many things going on at once, making it difficult to discern exactly what is going on, but all in all this is a great show and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a break from the norm.</p>

<p><a href="http://recess.unitedpixelworkers.com">Pixel Recess</a>. Another newcomer, this time <a href="https://twitter.com/dotdapple/status/492406515349729280">courtesy of Daniel Ignacio</a>, he described Pixel Recess as &#8220;a more design-y version of Bionic&#8221;. A huge fan of Bionic myself, I will admit that I was skeptical: I did not believe anyone could reproduce something so perfect on so many different levels as Bionic was, and as it turns out, I was right. However, that&#8217;s not to say that Pixel Recess is not a hilarious show, because it absolutely is: these have to be the best interviews I have ever heard. Completely absurd and always funny&#160;&#8212;&#160;in that respect, it is very much a close sibbling to Bionic.</p>

<p>Sam Dogen had another thought-provoking post over at Financial Samurai recently, this time looking at the very interesting difference between the way that Americans and Europeans in particular view money. I encourage you to read the entire thing: <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-europeans-see-money-differently-from-americans/">How Europeans See Money Differently From Americans</a>. Most interesting out of this entire piece, though, and definitely the most impactful statement for me, was that of his conclusion: &#8220;Remember that money is only a means to an end. What is your end?&#8221;</p>

<p>I finished last semester&#8217;s final exam on a Monday, and Tuesday I began work full-time, 8-4, 40 hours a week. Since then, I have picked up two more part-time jobs, ensuring that I have little time for anything but work. And that has been great, don&#8217;t get me wrong: I have bills to pay, and a slippery road late one night last winter made sure one of those bills was quite large. However, it also means I have not had a great deal of time to do many of the things I wanted to do this summer, unfortunately. Much too late, I&#8217;m afraid, within the last week or two, I have started to really take <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/its-not-about-the-money.html">my own words to heart</a> in asking, &#8220;What is the point of having all this money if I don&#8217;t do anything with it and with the people I enjoy spending time with?&#8221; And so that&#8217;s part of the reason my girlfriend and I went on a helicopter ride last weekend: money is great to have, but it&#8217;s completely useless if you never use it. I want to use it to make memories, and to do things that will leave a lasting impression that no number of digits could ever hope to. Going forward, that&#8217;s my plan; that is my end.</p>

<p>Worth linking to again, courtesy of Dave Pell&#8217;s The Next Draft this time around on the forty-fifth anniversary of Apollo 11&#8217;s historic mission: the speech President Nixon plan to give in the event of a moon disaster. Incredible, and remarkable chilling:</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do this often, but for all the help Tuts+ gave me as I worked to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-10.html">expand the functionality</a> of this design over the past few weeks, I can&#8217;t let it slip by without note. When I build a site, I prefer to do everything humanely possible with CSS rather than outsourcing it to JavaScript. Due to this perhaps irrational desire, everything&#160;&#8212;&#160;including device detection&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the ability to enter dark mode and save that preference across multiple sessions is managed strictly using CSS. As I&#8217;m sure you web developers out there can understand, this led to some sticky situations in which I almost resorted to a quick and dirty script. Thanks to resources like this one though, I managed to keep my use of JavaScript down to a minimum, and continue to ship a speedy site for you all to read. Next time you import jQuery out of habit, think back to this and ask yourself, &#8220;Can I do this with CSS?&#8221; Because after seeing tutorials like this, I bet you can.</p>

<p>Regardless of your own personal opinions regarding Christianity and religion in general, I think we can all get behind Sid&#8217;s overarching sentiment: it is important to remain true to yourself even when doing so means standing alone alongside an unpopular opinion. For in the end, with what will we find ourselves left? It is to these convictions we hold and must hold strongly that we will return; without them, we have nothing.</p>

<p>Stick to your guns. Be yourself. At the end of the day, I promise: you will be glad that you did.</p>

<p>Yet another week has come and gone, and here at the end we once again find ourselves with a collection of fantastic podcasts; some new and only just published, while others now have one more chance at enamoring a pair of fresh ears. Some new, some old, and all equally excellent.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2014/07/11/ep-087">The Talk Show Episode 87: &#8220;Free Alcoholic Beverages&#8221;, with Ben Thompson</a>. John Gruber has Ben Thompson on once again, this time to talk browser autofill, Samsung&#8217;s predicament between Apple at the high end and increasing competition from Xiaomi at the low end, and the importance of software differentiation even in a world where all hardware players are equal. As always, insightful and enlightening both.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/3/26/33-jay-clifford-my-eyeballs-were-vibrating">Unprofessional Episode 33: Jay Clifford &#160;&#8212;&#160; My Eyeballs Were Vibrating</a>. Lex and Dave talk to Jay Clifford about his various encounters with religion over the years, and share some intriguing insights of their own. Very interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-117-put-on-the-carrot-hat.html">Roderick on the Line 117: Put on the Carrot Hat</a>. We all have these incredible tools and fantastic opportunities now, to do and create things that previously only a select few could, but yet everything is getting progressively worse; less and less gets done. The democratization of creativity has not become the boon many believed it would in a time when the process of creating something cost a great deal more, but rather cause for concern going forward. As usual, a very interesting episode of Roderick on the Line.</p>

<p><a href="http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/tangential/episode-1-travel-around-in-a-hoverchair">Tangential Episode 01: Travel Around In A Hoverchair</a>. In the inaugural episode of Tangential, John Chidgey has Amit Jain and Vic Hudson on to talk Apple rumors and the morality of this business before touching on John&#8217;s nerd cred as a past iOS developer. Their discussion of iOS programming led to one wherein they came to the conclusion that the future of programming languages is in high-level implementations like Swift rather than C, and then derailed towards Family Guy, The Simpsons, and Star Trek. My favorite part of this podcast, however, was getting to hear John much more relaxed than he tends to be on Pragmatic: I love Pragmatic, and for that show his serious demeanor is appropriate, but getting to hear him loosen up was great; fantastic episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/179">Back to Work Episode 179: 7 Most Important Breasts for Your Re-Fi</a>. It&#8217;s hard to get noticed these days, and that has made some people resort to methods away from developing their presence as an individual in favor of methods more conducive to reaching greater audiences with less effort. Thus, we have seen the rise of platforms like Medium. Also, everyone was once there: it&#8217;s easy to think that the people who are not in your current position were always popular, but that&#8217;s not the case. Conversely, though, and this is something that&#8217;s a bit of a pet peeve of mine, many popular people seem to forget that they once were not.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/afterdark/466">After Dark Episode 466: After Back to Work 179</a>. Back in the early days of Back to Work, Dan and Merlin recorded an episode of After Dark for almost every episode of the main show. Lately, however, that has not been the case. This episode is reminiscent of those days since past, and it&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>Roughly once a week, give or take a few days, Brett Terpstra publishes a new installment in his &#8220;<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/topic/bookmarks/">Web Excursions</a>&#8221; series, where he talks about interesting bookmarks from around the internet.

<p>You cannot&#160;&#8212;&#160;ought not&#160;&#8212;&#160;judge the Fire phone by the traditional standards against which we have come to judge all devices these days, but rather from the perspective of a goods and services company that seeks to facilitate streamlined access to its storefront for its most loyal and devoted customers by offering them a device integrated with its own services to a degree made impossible through third-party integration alone on another device maker&#8217;s platform. When considered in this light, the Fire Phone is, inarguably, an interesting proposition that more than merits the considerable number of think-pieces that have been devoted to it since its announcement. This is the point Ben Thompson makes here, and makes so, so very well.</p>

<p>In a style made popular by Benedict Evans in his hallmark Twitter postulations, posit: computers were created for writers. As such, the next iteration of computing devices will cater to the needs of others: creators and designers will have Jarvis-like artificial intelligence systems to converse with and holographic interfaces to involve their entire bodies in the creation process. The current model involves the two tools of the writer&#8217;s trade: their hands and their minds. Future implementations will go beyond those unnecessary restrictions that don&#8217;t apply in other fields in order to provide a richer, more productive computing experience.</p>

<p>Already, we have begun to see this happening in the mobile industry: we have collectively eschewed the traditional mechanical keyboard for one implemented in software that only appears when necessary, signaling our decreasing reliance on the once-dominant input method in favor of other visual metaphors and, recently, voice as well. Where once computers required keyboard input to perform even the most basic of tasks, the vast majority of those actions are now prompted on-screen; soon, it is not ridiculous to assume that we will see this input method fade away in favor of voice; and later, another will once again take its place.</p>

<p>So goes the cyclical nature of computing, where one inferior experience is inevitably succeeded by a superior one. It is easy, then, to predict future change; the difficulty, however, comes in when determining form that change will take.</p>

<p>I have made my guess, and my guess is more immerse input methods geared towards a generation who will not use their computing devices primarily to write; what&#8217;s yours?</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-16 07:04:17-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/16 07:04:17 EST</time>
<p>Every so often an article crosses my path wherein the author drools over a custom shop&#8217;s awesome modifications to an already awesome vehicle, and then I invariably spend a good long while extricating myself from the inevitable rabbit hole that ensues. As of this writing, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/el-diablo-jeep.html">nearly four months have passed since I have gone down that path</a>, continuing my trend of leaving roughly <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/superhero-vehicles.html">three months</a> between each of these articles. Today, I&#8217;m back for another round: thanks to the rediscovery of three monsters I squirreled away in my Instapaper queue a number of weeks ago, and only just recently rediscovered, I finally have cause to once again spend time appreciating these mechanical marvels at the intersection of industrial design and raw power.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Full-Metal-Jacket-Jeep.jpg' alt='Full Metal Jacket Jeep' title='Full Metal Jacket Jeep' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>First on my list is the <a href="http://www.blessthisstuff.com/stuff/vehicles/cars/full-metal-jacket-jeep-by-starwood-motors/">Full Metal Jacket Jeep by Starwood Motors</a>. If you took every aspect of a Jeep that makes it commonplace and approachable to the everyday car buyer, stripped that away, and then made the result passably safe and street legal, this is what you would end up with: the comforting colors have disappeared, replaced with a menacing matte black; in favor of all but the necessary structural components, heavy-duty cargo netting fulfills the jobs doors and a roof once did. Couple these modifications with a nice lift kit, some off-road tires, and a few additional bells and whistles, and you find yourself saddled with a vehicle capable of seemingly anything. This reminds me of a more capable, more rugged version of Starwood Motors&#8217; <a href="https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/4x4-showdown-el-diablo-jeep">El Diablo</a>.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Jeep-Wrangler-Nighthawk.jpg' alt='Jeep Wrangler Nighthawk' title='Jeep Wrangler Nighthawk' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Given the Full Metal Jacket&#8217;s design, I think it would be fair to say that it takes a special person to pull that Jeep off, and to do so well. For everyone else wanting a rugged yet slightly less imposing vehicle, and one perhaps more suited to day-to-day travels rather than weathering extreme scenarios reminiscent of the apocalypse, Starwood Motors created the <a href="http://www.blessthisstuff.com/stuff/vehicles/cars/jeep-wrangler-nighthawk-by-starwood-motors/">Jeep Wrangler Nighthawk</a>. Pictured above, it reads as a toned down version of the Full Metal Jacket&#160;&#8212;&#160;to great effect, I might add: it comes off as a slightly less audacious yet nevertheless similarly eye-catching vehicle. I would happily drive this one around town&#160;&#8212;&#160;or anywhere, really.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Toyota-Tundra-Devolro.jpg' alt='Toyota Tundra Devolro' title='Toyota Tundra Devolro' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Now, not everyone is a Jeep person. It has something to do with the whole &#8220;topless and dirty&#8221; thing, I think. Regardless though, if even the Nighthawk doesn&#8217;t quite fit your needs, or maybe if you&#160;&#8212;&#160;like me&#160;&#8212;&#160;just love a good truck, you could always settle&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>ahem</em>, and I use the term lightly&#160;&#8212;&#160;for Devolro&#8217;s custom-built Toyota Tundra. Featuring the same aesthetic leanings of the Full Metal Jacket Jeep, Devolro completely rebuilt the Tundra and upgraded nearly everything in the process. To get an idea as to what form these enhancements took, the lowest tier Tundra from Devolro sports a 5.7L V8 engine coming in at 381 horsepower, while Toyota does not offer that level of power until you upgrade to their highest tier; the folks over at Devolro aren&#8217;t messing around.</p>

<p>So there you have it, three of the coolest vehicles on the road today. If you enjoyed this post, check back again soon: I already have a few more lined up for another, similar article in the very near future. With any luck, this will be the last time I wait three months to delve into the world of custom, souped-up vehicles.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-15 16:32:37-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/15 16:32:37 EST</time>
<p>Since starting this website nearly two years ago, I have written specifically about the engine that runs it exactly four times: in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-first-crack.html">Introducing First Crack</a>, I detailed my long journey to the realization that I needed to build something completely my own, from the ground up; later, I talked about some of my creation&#8217;s niceties in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-in-practice.html">First Crack in Practice</a>, before outlining the changes an innocuous redesign brought about in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/complete-overhaul.html">First Crack&#8217;s Complete Overhaul</a>. Finally, some eleven months later, I returned to once again briefly run down my latest updates in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">Changes to First Crack</a>. Since then, however, for the last six months, I have not said a peep. Today, that changes with the release of First Crack 1.0 to the public.</p>

<p>I could wax on for paragraphs extolling the virtues of this CMS over others, explaining why I built it and believe it superior to the alternatives, or talking about the neat, helpful features I tried to tuck in wherever I could. However, I have done that before, and I doubt anyone wants to read that once again any more than I want to write it all over again. So instead, I wrote out a short, five-item list of highlights I want everyone to walk away from this article with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast. First Crack is, by any standard, remarkably fast: it can take a completely empty directory structure and build a fully-functioning website of 725 articles, along with a full-text RSS feed to boot, in less than 1.25 seconds. That&#8217;s pretty darn quick.</li>
<li>Simple. First Crack runs on the widely-available Python engine using only built-in libraries, and works with simple plain text files formatted in Markdown. This means that on a Mac, you can go from nothing to having a website in just slightly longer than it will take you to write your first article. First Crack also works on a PC thanks to the magic of Cygwin, although you will have to install Python as well; unfortunately, it does not come pre-installed on every computer.</li>
<li>Portable. Wherever you have access to Python, you can run First Crack. With some minor modifications, that even means iOS.</li>
<li>Customizable. At less than 700 lines of well-documented code, customizing First Crack to fit your needs will prove much easier than you might at first suspect. Even if you don&#8217;t write Python for a living, or just don&#8217;t feel as strong a kinship with the language as I do, you can still easily change the structure and presentation of your site thanks to the modular approach I took when building this. Instead of messing with XML or YAML configuration files, just add or remove elements from a simple HTML document whenever you want to change the structure of your site; and if you want to change the look and feel, go ahead and make the necessary modifications the the standalone CSS document. Easy.</li>
<li>Beautiful. By no means the furthest thing from my mind throughout the development process, I designed every aspect of First Crack&#160;&#8212;&#160;from the back-end code parsing the Markdown files to the front-end HTML documents&#160;&#8212;&#160;with an eye for the difficult balance between form and function. And although I could just be biased, I think I have struck it well, and doubly so on the user-facing side: First Crack generates an attractive, responsive site that will look beautifully simple regardless of you and your readers&#8217; chosen device. So whether it&#8217;s Federico Viticci viewing your site on his iPad or Marco Arment with his Mac Pro and massive DELL monitors, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.</li>
</ul>

<p>First Crack is not the simplest CMS on the market, but I did not create it with that goal in mind: I wrote First Crack intending it to serve as a simple, fast, and easy-to-use blogging engine I could run on anything from my iPhone to a server, and in that respect it has succeeded remarkably well. Nevertheless, I am not so naive to believe that it is perfect&#160;&#8212;&#160;but that&#8217;s the point: I have honed it to a degree where I believe it suitable for public release, and so I have decided to put it out today in the hopes that some of you will try it and then let me know where I have fallen short, what needs improved, and where I should take this in the future. So please, head over to Github and give it a shot: the only things you need are Python, a terminal window, and a willingness to give some script a kid from Ohio wrote in his spare time a try.</p>

<p>Very interesting take on the recent flare up around Disruption Theory, and how Lepore was not necessarily wrong to criticize Christenson and his theory, but that she did point to the wrong permutation of it: it is not necessarily the base theory that is flawed, but rather the watered-down version we find in use so often today. John Kirk then proceeded to delve further into the theory in a great follow up to Ben Thompson&#8217;s <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/critiquing-disruption-theory.html">recent piece</a>, <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/critiquing-disruption-theory/">Critiquing Disruption Theory</a>.</p>

<p>I linked to this piece by Ben Thompson in the title only because it is his most recent on the topic of disruption theory; I strongly encourage you to start with his earlier piece from last year titled &#8220;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/">What Clayton Christenson Got Wrong</a>&#8221;, where he more fully explains the theory and further expands upon some of its flaws. Especially if you&#160;&#8212;&#160;like me until now&#160;&#8212;&#160;only know of Disruption Theory in the abstract as explained in passing here and there, these two articles from Ben are a fantastic place to start.</p>

<p>I am considering using a boilerplate for the introduction to this article, and keeping the actual noteworthy content the dynamic aspect going forward. So, let&#8217;s give it a try with last week&#8217;s opening: &#8220;Another week, another set of great podcasts for your listening pleasure. Enjoy.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2012/12/11/18-all-the-flavor-you-can-handle-marco-arment">Unprofessional Episode 18: Marco Arment &#160;&#8212;&#160; All the Flavor You Can Handle</a>. Marco Arment joins Dave and Lex to talk dieting, fussy coffee, and one-night stands of the Linux variety.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2012/12/18/19-the-opposite-of-name-dropping-glenn-fleishman">Unprofessional Episode 19: Glenn Fleishman &#160;&#8212;&#160; The Opposite of Name Dropping</a>. Dave, Lex, and Glenn Fleishman on Twitter, fame, and celebrities in an interesting conversation that prompted the question, &#8220;Why are we [writers on the internet] in this? Why do we write? To what end? And for what purpose?&#8221; A very important question that I, unfortunately, don&#8217;t yet have a great answer to.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/1/2/21-motherbleeper-mike-lee">Unprofessional Episode 21: Mike Lee &#160;&#8212;&#160; Motherbleeper</a>. (Can you tell that I&#8217;m on a bit of an Unprofessional kick?) Everyone has become so ridiculously sensitive these days, taking offense at even the slightest perceived slight or deviance from the safest of paths. If you are one such person, do not listen to this show: it features a hilarious discussion with Mike Lee on making world-changing software, and offending people both intentionally and unintentionally; if there is any doubt in your mind as to whether you may find this offensive or not, I have no doubt that you will.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/2/23/22-whos-your-haberdasher-serenity-caldwell">Unprofessional Episode 22: Serenity Caldwell &#160;&#8212;&#160; Who&#8217;s Your Haberdasher?</a>. Very interesting conversation with Serenity Caldwell, Lex, and Dave about finding your passion, following it, and separating the things that you are passionate about from your hobbies.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/bionic/95">Bionic Episode 95: Turning Sadness into Titles</a>. To great sadness, Bionic ended last week after two years, fifty great episodes, and forty-five spectacular ones; it truly was a sad day in the podcasting world when Matt and Myke signed off for the last time. I will miss them greatly, but I wish both the best.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-009-the-societal-perspective/">Exponent Episode 09: The Societal Perspective</a>. Fascinating episode on the justifications of economic theories that at first glance&#160;&#8212;&#160;and even upon further inspection, for many&#160;&#8212;&#160;appear evil in the most basic sense of the word. And then, later, the continuation of their previous discussion on disruption: should it come from existing corporations or startups?</p>

<p>I would like to end with a request rather than in the usual manner I tend to finish these: if you have a particular podcast you feel ought to find its way onto this list, send it over: I would be more than happy to give it a listen; I absolutely love podcasts, and the more great shows I can find, the better. So hit me up on Twitter: if you don&#8217;t already know of me there, my username is <a href="http://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk">@zacjszewczyk</a>.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-12 07:25:08-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/12 07:25:08 EST</time>
<p>From the Woman Suffrage movement of the late nineteenth century to the early 1920s, to the Civil Rights movement during the &#8216;50s and &#8217;60s, American history in particular has suffered many bruises at the hands of remarkable injustices. Even going back further to the 1700s, at the dawn of the Revolutionary War, the Founding Fathers laid the foundation for this nation as the result of an affront they and their constituents considered intolerable. Since then, we as a people have proven unable to shake our masochistic obsession-bordering-on-fascination with this approach to social governance. Quite unfortunately, I might add, for despite a brief respite of fifty-odd years since the last major social movement, increasing civil unrest has brought us to the doorstep of yet another, albeit hopefully less violent, confrontation between social norms and its ever-changing landscape.</p>

<p>These days, few would even attempt to validate a society in which women did not have the same rights as men. More importantly though, even if someone did try to make such a case, all but an insignificantly small number of people would rightfully disregard these statements as the baseless vestiges of a bygone era. So, too, the situation has become for those discriminating based upon race: for all but a small number of pockets throughout this country, racism has become not only intolerable, but nonexistent as well. Thus has the pendulum swung from one maximum of extreme inappropriate behavior back towards a center of measured, evenhanded treatment towards all. However, just as a pendulum continues to swing even after reaching its inflection point, so, too, have we begun to see these social movements take their causes far beyond their initial call for equality and into a realm bordering on&#160;&#8212;&#160;if not completely based in&#160;&#8212;&#160;vindictive restitution at the expense of individuals who, oftentimes, had nothing to do with the initial upset.</p>

<p>With respect to the Woman Suffrage movement, we may find evidence of this byzantine search for compensation in a roundabout way by examining the recent and rapidly-growing feminism movement. I do believe that society has yet to fully come to terms with women and men as equal participants, and that as a result we ought to continue pushing the envelope on this issue, but I also firmly believe that a disturbing majority of the events often held up as cause for outcry are vastly overblown. Nevertheless, anyone dealing with something even remotely near this issue, whether the two have a real connection or nothing more than a perceived linkage, has no choice but to tread lightly and as if on eggshells lest they incur the unproductive wrath of a legion of armchair activists. In the end, then, few make any progress whatsoever, and more often than not actually take a step backward with each and every outlash as privately-held prejudices have no chance of ever seeing the light of day and, as a result, changing. Thus we end the day ultimately squarely where we began it, and so the cycle repeats with increasing ferocity on one side and accordingly less participation for fear of it on the other.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the broad narrative around the issue of racial inequality has become similarly politically-charged. Inner-city America has continued a disturbing devolution into a welfare state, and shows no signs of stopping any time soon. At the heart of this transition are ethnic minorities who, once persecuted based solely on the color of their skin, now put on such an air of entitlement so as to audaciously believe themselves deserving of a comfortable, full, and enjoyable life merely for existing due to the (sometimes perceived) injustices suffered by their predecessors. And so no meaningful discussion can occur on this and any related issues, due in large part to the fact that those willing to participate must perform such a convoluted dance so as to keep from offending the vocal factions contributing to the problem each and every day. The same can be said for the current state of gay rights in America, where members of this group suffered from discrimination for so long that now, now that we as a society have begun to realize the inappropriately harmful level to which this prejudice was taken far too often, any discourse on this subject must be so carefully metered, edited, and hedged that no significant progress ever results. Here, too, we have swung from one wildly inappropriate extreme to another, where a ridiculous level of sensitivity precludes any and all from making meaningful strides in the right direction.</p>

<p>Recently, I have had the same misfortune many others have undoubtedly had in witnessing obesity transition from an odd rarity to the uncomfortable norm to, more recently, an acceptable state of existence. A society that created and later idolized the infamous proportions of Barbie dolls now creates <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/03/05/realistic-barbie-doll/">&#8220;realistic Barbies&#8221;</a> to instill an acceptance of mediocrity at a young age. Yes, Barbie dolls may have contributed to the pursuit of an unattainable goal; but no, I cannot see their demise as&#160;&#8212;&#160;even if they served no greater purpose than that of a subtle push in the direction of health over a lazy existence&#160;&#8212;&#160;a boon for the upcoming generations of young women. Just as the aforementioned social movements pressed on after the requisite points necessary to achieve their initial goals of equality amongst all genders and races, this less pronounced acceptance of the unhealthy has begun to go too far. Gradually, ever so slowly, it is becoming okay to be overweight and unhealthy; gradually, ever so slowly, the pendulum passes the midpoint and begins swinging towards the other direction.</p>

<p>Because God forbid we ever impose upon someone else.</p>

<p>Yes; fantastic piece from Sid O&#8217;Neill. I myself have begun to wonder the same things lately, questioning how I became so pedantic and obsessed with things of such little real importance that I would wax on endlessly about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/misunderstood.html">a simple ad</a>, of all things. Yet, unlike Sid, I have been able to suppress those uncomfortable questions until very recently. As time marches on, however, and the amount of time I devote to this hobby only grows, this is a very real reality that I must confront. And as for what I will ultimately answer? Time will only tell; were I forced to make a prediction now, though, I would wager I end up on the same side of this issue as Sid.</p>

<p>I never had a problem with the aesthetics of iOS 7, and continue to have no troubles whatsoever with it running atop my iPhone 4S: my phone never restarts, and my battery works just fine&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially for a device rapidly approaching its third birthday. Nevertheless, I can appreciate that many have had numerous and insurmountable problems in these areas as well as in many others, and that these issues have made iOS 7 a very difficult release with which to reckon their faith in Apple. And when framed in this light, I can understand why some would characterize their experience with iOS 7 as &#8220;bitter&#8221;. However, no significant, meaningful change comes without at least some modicum of pain: one does not become fit without straining at the gym, and becoming a big-time fancy-pants blogger takes more than one sleepless night along with a fair amount of effort. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind, then, the difference between necessary and unnecessary pain. This, I believe, was the former, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least for me&#160;&#8212;&#160;a relatively painless evolution at that.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-08 07:25:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/08 07:25:31 EST</time>
<p>Quite some time ago, I started this draft with a simple premise: precluding success is failure of at least one effort in a given area. Put differently, those who have yet to fail in their chosen profession can never attain greatness in that field. Along with this supposition, I included one more stipulation as an addendum to the previous statement: one can, however, substitute knowledge, to a degree, for failure. Regardless of the knowledge amassed relating to a particular skill set or field of study though, the best one can hope for is mediocrity without the essential, formative impact even one failure invariably brings with it. Thus, from these somewhat humble beginnings, I began to craft this article.</p>

<p>Recently, Shawn Blanc has been on a bit of a creativity kick: with his article <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/05/fighting-to-stay-creative/">Fighting to Stay Creative</a>, he explained some of the barriers and aids to this crucial element of any maker&#8217;s life, and has since recorded a number of podcasts on this topic. Before him, many others have spoken to this subject, and a host of others will undoubtedly continue this trend in the future. I bring this seemingly unrelated genre up now, though, despite appearing at best little more than tenuously related to the topic at hand, because I believe it an incredibly important element of success. Important, however, but not necessary: Apple exhibited remarkable creativity with the advent of the iPhone and iOS in a world dominated by flip phones and Windows Mobile, yet Samsung still managed to capitalize on that creativity and attain a pale imitation of the success Apple enjoys, but success nonetheless. Moreover, an abundance of creativity, just as an absence of the same does not deny it, does not guarantee success: Google Glass is inarguably creative, regardless of your own views on the technology, yet none would argue its success outside of a very small sect. There must be something else, then, something that can bridge this perplexing disparity between creativity and success. I believe that &#8220;something&#8221; is much less glamorous than creativity and all the artisanal niceties that go along with it; I believe that &#8220;something&#8221; rarely receives the credit it deserves, because no one likes to attribute their success to such an ugly and&#160;&#8212;&#160;in their eyes&#160;&#8212;&#160;unfortunate happenstance as this one. I believe that &#8220;something&#8221; is failure.</p>

<p>Quite famously, Thomas Edison built between <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/OnFailingG.html">1,000</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanfurr/2011/06/09/how-failure-taught-edison-to-repeatedly-innovate/">10,000</a> iterations of his light bulb before discovering a model that worked reliably. Although he hesitated to call these &#8220;failures&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;the one aspect of this story the innumerable, conflicting sources recounting this tale manage to agree on&#160;&#8212;&#160;, by the term&#8217;s very definition they are just that: events lacking in success. By choosing to experiment in a field that, at the time, benefited from very little previous work, failure was a necessity regardless of whether you choose to agree with my fundamental supposition or not, for there was quite literally no way for him to determine the best combination of form factor and components to create the most effective light bulb without trying every single one he could get his hands on.</p>

<p>Today, although we in the creative professions do not go around reinventing the light bulb every day, we do, by the definition of the term used to describe this line of work, often venture into uncharted territories where few others&#160;&#8212;&#160;if any&#160;&#8212;&#160;have traveled before us. We do this in an effort at lending our creations value over that of our peers, and thus for this reason we may liken our work to that of Mr. Edison&#8217;s. Given this similarity, why would we not extend it to also value the failures, just as Thomas Edision did, we happen upon along the way?</p>

<p>Consider, also, investment strategies and the business of wealth accumulation. Throughout our lives, we spend the majority of our waking hours in pursuit of some semblance of wealth. For most, this takes the form of a traditional 9-5 job. Few, however, go through their lives with this their sole source of income: many also choose to invest a portion of their money in some way, and sometimes do so in risky endeavors at the promise of larger returns should the venture succeed. We do this all in pursuit of our own definition of financial success, and in service of that larger end goal financial advisors enter the picture to help mitigate the risk we take in wagering to maximize the value of our hard-earned funds. In this way, we offload a small portion of the failure necessary to truly attain impressive success and replace it with a professional&#8217;s knowledge. We cannot, however, feasibly hope to achieve our financial goals by hiring someone at an investment firm: at best, we may aim for mediocrity. How many, after all, would have advised investing in motorized carriages in a world built for horse-drawn models? Or Apple when its stock hit a low of $1.62 in the early 1980s? Or even Microsoft, for that matter, when its stock sold for $0.10 around the same time? In order to overcome that hump of normalcy, we must either take our fortunes into our own hands or at the very least authorize another to do it for us, and then <em>take risks</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in other words, open ourselves up for failure, and then fail, and then press on in the hopes that we may invest prudently enough to end the day with a windfall.</p>

<p>With two examples supporting my thesis, I feel compelled to offer up one seemingly in direct opposition to it, and explain why my theory holds true in the face of this example. Consider, then, skydiving, a profession where excellence is demanded from day one and failure is not an option. By the thesis I laid out at the beginning of this article, success is unattainable here; however, that&#8217;s not quite the case: in such a profession as this one, preparedness and daring replace the need for failure as a prerequisite to success. In fact, I might go so far as to argue that these two could replace failure in any space: failure is a necessity because it means we are pushing the bounds of our comfort zones to such an extent that we break free of them, and hopefully in doing so create something incredible or learn enough from the experience that the next time a similar opportunity presents itself, we may handle it in such a way to receive a respectable return. With a great deal of preparation though, and a willingness to go right up against the boundaries of safety, I believe we can achieve the same result that accepting the necessity of failure leaves us with in the end. Failure still precludes success in this space, then, but that does not mean one has to attain it by incorrectly packing a parachute.</p>

<p>In my own life, I have failed quite a few times over the years. Even limiting the scope to my off-again on-again career as a writer, I have still failed what feels like a remarkable number of times. None of these bother me though, because&#160;&#8212;&#160;to paraphrase something Mr. Edison likely once said&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have just found a few different ways not to write every day, and a few more ways not to run a site. Every time I discover one of these ways not to do something I so desperately want to, I get a little bit better though, and I take one step closer to attaining the success I strive to reach. Could this site finally be the place where, after more abandoned blogs than I care to remember, I finally rise above it all? I still can&#8217;t say for sure, but I hope I will look back on this day a few years from now and wish I had said &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</p>

<p>I have put off starting a podcast for a long time now, just as I have done with a simple recording to apply for a spot on Brett Terpstra&#8217;s Systematic. I do that, though, because I feel afraid that the end product will not only fall short of my expectations, but those of everyone who listens to it as well. But really, would that be so bad? Or, taken a step further, wouldn&#8217;t that be great? Because eventually it will have to be terrible, and eventually I will have to fail, otherwise how can I ever hope to become successful? So just as I leave myself with these questions to ponder, so, too, will I leave you with a similar question to consider: what will you fail at next?</p>

<p>This situation really is crazy. Part of the problem, though, at least where Twitter is concerned, is that Twitter does not use the t.co shortener until <em>after</em> a tweet is posted, which means after it imposes the 140 character limit. Especially for me where every link to one of my own articles that I post starts with &#8220;zacjszewczyk.com/Structure&#8221;, this makes not using my own shortener&#160;&#8212;&#160;in this case, Bitly&#160;&#8212;&#160;completely impractical. Even then though, there is no real justification for even this many redirects, and especially not as many as Scott found here. Insane.</p>

<p>Another week, (thankfully) another set of great podcasts for your listening pleasure. Be sure to pay special attention to this series&#8217; latest addition, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;as always&#160;&#8212;&#160;enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivemorethings.com/17">Five More Things Episode 17: 50 Cent is Actually Brilliant</a>. Turns out 50 Cent actually has some great life advice&#160;&#8212;&#160;who would have guessed. Surprise aside though, he did make some very interesting suggestions that I would like to at least try implementing in my own life. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esn.fm/tyfc/10">Thank You for Calling! Episode 10: The Key Holder</a>. The epic conclusion to Christina Warren, Casey Liss, and Mois&#233;s Chiullan&#8217;s two-part saga on their young adulthood spent working in video game retailers. My favorite part: &#8220;If you ever come back to this store, I will rip your [expletive] head off.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thecampfireproject.com/episodes/2014/6/29/016">The Campfire Project Episode 16: The First Step is Raising People&#8217;s Consciousness</a>. I generally avoid these types of shows, but this talk with Brianna Wu, Matt Duesenbury, and Chris Domico on misogyny and the current culture towards women, especially in tech, was extremely eye-opening and cause for much thought on my part. Even if you, like me, are quite frankly burned out on this and its related topics, I highly encourage you to give this episode a shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/2/23/pack-me-some-sandwiches-amy-jane-gruber">Unprofessional Episode 01: Amy Jane Gruber&#160;&#8212;&#160;Pack Me Some Sandwiches</a>. I finally understand why everyone loves this show so much: it&#8217;s absolutely hilarious, and Lex Friedman and Dave Wiskus are fantastic co-hosts. For this episode, they talk with Amy Gruber about how she and John met, parenting philosophies, and airplane etiquette.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/2/23/6-designated-bunter-dan-moren">Unprofessional Episode 06: Dan Moren&#160;&#8212;&#160;Designated Bunter</a>. Lex Friedman, Dave Wiskus, and Dan Moren were all nerds in school. Also, nicknames can be tough.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2012/11/20/15-lets-talk-about-me-faith-korpi">Unprofessional Episode 15: Faith Korpi&#160;&#8212;&#160;Let&#8217;s Talk About Me</a>. Dave and Lex talk names and dispel some myths about homeschoolers with Faith Korpi. Also: traveling, college, extracurricular activities, and bucket lists.</p>

<p><a href="http://stormingmortal.com/14">Storming Mortal Episode 14: Star Trek was always there and print happens later with Jason Snell</a>. An&#382;e Tomi&#263; sat down with Jason Snell to talk about TV and the future of both journalism and print publications. Quite a few interesting observations in here.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-03 17:18:23-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/03 17:18:23 EST</time>
<p>The problem with Google Glass is not that it is inherently creepy, but rather that it has the potential for many uses of dubious morality; and as our minds happened upon those possibilities in the wake of Glass&#8217; unveiling, and we paused to ponder an appropriate reaction to these eventualities, it became socially acceptable to walk around smacking these expensive devices off the faces of those who deigned to wear them. Like a small child who, in the split second before a parent can exert physical restraint, runs off unknowingly towards a potentially harmful situation, so, too, did the least of us jump on this brief respite in the broad narrative of what is and is not acceptable and begin harming others for something we readily admit that we do not understand.</p>

<p>Like the cave men of a day long past who witnessed, for the briefest of seconds, the power of fire following a lightning strike, and rightfully shied away from it, we, too, have been given a fleeting and admittedly incomplete glimpse of the technology that will bring us to the next technological age. Will we shy away from this advance as well? Will we continue barbarically smashing these gadgets because we fail to understand their use, their purpose, their significance to our future, just as our neanderthalic ancestors did once upon a time to their lone brethren who approached with a smoldering stick in his hand?</p>

<p>For our sake, I hope not. They got over it, after all, but the question nevertheless remains: will we?</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-02 06:54:04-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/02 06:54:04 EST</time>
<p>Since Apple began requiring that developers submitting applications to the Mac App Store sandbox their products, it has remained a somewhat controversial decision. Two years after the rule went in to effect, it continues to preclude a number of great apps from sharing in the spotlight Apple so generously&#160;&#8212;&#160;and to such great effect&#160;&#8212;&#160;sheds on its platform&#8217;s developers by featuring their creations on the store&#8217;s front page. Nevertheless, by allowing users to continue downloading and installing programs from outside locations, Apple has avoided any significant amount of criticism; in fact, by presenting it as the security boon that it inarguably is, many praise this decision as a boon for all. And in reality, that is exactly the case: everyone, from developer to consumer benefited from this stipulation, including Apple itself.</p>

<p>At a very high level, in order to qualify as sandboxed, developers must write their apps in such a way that they can function without the need of information outside that which the user inputs into said application. The actual distinction is much more nuanced and complex, but for simplicity&#8217;s sake assume this covers at least the basic concept. Put differently, when written according to these guidelines, the result ought to work regardless of other apps and services installed on a given machine; its self-reliance demands that, for the most part, all the necessary features and functionality be built in and accessible to the app every time it runs.</p>

<p>As I thought about this the other day, it dawned on me that perhaps Apple&#8217;s move to sandboxing on OS X and the associated boost in security was not a goal in and of itself, but rather an incidental benefit flowing from their shift to annual release cycles and the resulting necessity to have fast development among small teams. In this way, on top of the security benefits that come naturally from restricting applications from accessing each others&#8217; data, this then-newfound mantra would have also made it much easier for Apple to develop by department&#160;&#8212;&#160;they can develop in their own sandboxes now, if you will forgive the bad joke, and thus spend less time and energy worrying about app interoperability and more valuable time and energy focusing on creating great products. Because, <a href="http://peroty.com/blog/wrote-about/this-is-what-apple-makes/">after all</a>, in the end it is the resultant experience with which Apple is truly marketing itself and attaining fantastic success.</p>

<p>This is no earth-shattering revelation, I will readily admit, but rather little more than a potentially interesting observation I happened upon one day as my mind wandered from one indeterminate thing to another just as wispy thought. But it is my hope that some will find this somewhat interesting, and if at the end of the day I have pushed just one person to thought, then I will have succeeded.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-07-01 07:02:24-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-07.html">07</a>/01 07:02:24 EST</time>
<p>It has been quite a while since I posted one of these&#160;&#8212;&#160;more than a month, in fact: the last came out at <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-414.html">the beginning of May</a>. Today, I finally have cause to bring this series back. Finally&#160;&#8212;&#160;far too long has passed during which I had no cause to sit down and revel in the simple beauty of nature and its rustic inhabitants.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/86501972746/adelaide-tarn-hut-near-kahurangi-national-park">a quaint hut near Kahurangi National Park, New Zealand</a>. As is often the case with many of these cabins, the scenery surrounding this little structure vastly outclasses the small building at its heart; beautiful. And those mountains&#160;&#8212;&#160;they just beg to be climbed. I could have a <em>lot</em> of fun here.</p>

<p>Another small cabin that, like the previous entry, sits on the shore of a lake. This one, however, hails from the <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/87631807475/boat-house-in-stockholm-archipelago-sweden">Stockholm archipelago in Sweden</a>. It reminds me of a friend&#8217;s cabin in northern Minnesota, albeit his was slightly larger than this one, and set slightly farther back from the shore. Ah, the good times we had there.</p>

<p>Significantly closer to me than both the last two, this <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/88406543967/abandoned-cabin-southeast-of-salt-lake-city-utah">abandoned cabin southeast of Salt Lake City, Utah</a>, is just incredible. I can&#8217;t quite decide if it is the mountains rising up to the cabin&#8217;s left and right or the backdrop of pine trees that make it so appealing to me, but regardless I would love to happen upon this one when out on a hike.</p>

<p><a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/88393708085/scotts-cabin-beaver-brook-ny-contributed">Scott&#8217;s Cabin</a> located in Beaver Brook, NY, where the editors of Cabin Porn live. A better, larger image can be found at <a href="http://beaverbrook.com/post/88393649009/scotts-cabin">Beaver Brook&#8217;s tumblr page</a>, but you don&#8217;t have to go there to appreciate the simple beauty of this neat cabin.</p>

<p>When I think of New York, I picture skyscrapers and traffic&#160;&#8212;&#160;anything but the rustic cabins I link to in these posts, really. But maybe that&#8217;s why Ben Dickson decided to build <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/89108493870/backyard-tea-shed-in-clinton-hill-brooklyn">a backyard &#8220;tea shed&#8221;</a> in the heart of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to take a long hiking trip in the winter. A few summers ago I spent a week on the Appalachian trail, but as of yet have not spent any time out in all but the most clement of weather. <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/88994321305/log-cabin-in-eastern-sayan-mountains-siberia">This log cabin in the Eastern Sayan Mountains of Siberia</a> reminds me of that desire every time I see it. Perhaps someday; until then, though, it&#8217;s great to have something to keep that wish at the forefront of my mind.</p>

<p>Not much of <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90060317355/jackal-hut-rocky-mountains-colorado">a cabin</a> to look at, from what we can see here anyway, but with a sky like this who needs to keep their eyes turned anywhere but skyward? More beautiful scenery from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would love to visit there one day.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sights like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/89757711805/abandoned-a-frames-in-lago-general-carrera">this one on the Lago General Carrera river in Chilean Patagonia</a> that make me want to drop everything, load a backpack, and spend a long, long time backpacking in different places across the world in search of a much simpler, less stressful life. Give me one of these alongside a river like this and I would be happy.</p>

<p>This time from one of my favorite new sites, Bless This Stuff, <a href="http://www.blessthisstuff.com/stuff/living/living-space/casa-till-by-wmr-architects/">Casa Till</a>. My dream house would be slightly less gaudy, but I definitely would not turn down some time here.</p>

<p>So there you have it, nine neat cabins and otherwise cool structures set amidst beautiful scenery. It&#8217;s great to be back.</p>

<p>Finally, after an uncomfortable few weeks of just one or two entries here, I have amassed a respectable roster highlighting the past week&#8217;s best podcasts. Enjoy!</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/quit/51">Quit! Episode 51: No Silver Bullet</a>. Shawn Blanc and Dan Benjamin recorded a remarkably inspiring discussion about finding the job you love and turning that into a sustainable career. It just so happened that this episode came on as I prepped a house to get painted at my &#8220;jobby-job&#8221;, as Merlin would call it, and so I spent the rest of the day deep in thought, considering my future as I wiped walls and taped trim. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a pretty good job and a great boss, but it made me really sit back and wonder whether this sort of work is what I should spend my time on if I hope to one day take a completely different path. I don&#8217;t yet have an answer, but it has been a while since anything&#160;&#8212;&#160;podcast or otherwise&#160;&#8212;&#160;has caused this much introspection on my part.</p>

<p><a href="http://esn.squarespace.com/thank-you-for-calling/9-the-summer-of-99">Thank You for Calling! Episode 09: The Summer of &#8217;99</a>. An interesting and enjoyable look into the world of video game and electronics sales, with Casey Liss, Christina Warren, and Mois&#233;s Chiullan. All at once I was both thankful and slightly disappointed that, by comparison, my job entails so little stress and complexity.</p>

<p><a href="http://stormingmortal.com/4/">Storming Mortal Episode 04: Pink Tanktops, Ben Brooks And The Fact That We Are All Just Some Guy with Pat Dryburgh</a>. Besides choosing an awesome name for a podcast, An&#382;e Tomi&#263; also does a great job interviewing his guests, and this all-around fun interview with Pat Dryburgh was no exception: they talked about, among other things, Pat&#8217;s podcast <a href="http://patdryburgh.com/link/hundred-down">Hundred Down</a> and his struggle with weight loss, interspersed with moments of hilarity as the curmudgeonly Ben Brooks came up often alongside the revered pink tank-top. Lots of fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://stormingmortal.com/5/">Storming Mortal Episode 05: On the Measured/Thoughtful Approach, When @imyke and @viticci Sleep and Our Generations Greatest Philosopher with Matt Alexander</a>. If you, like me, love the current Bionic, and especially if you have stuck around since the beginning, you will appreciate this episode with Matt Alexander from just before his and Myke Hurley&#8217;s show really went off the rails; a great retrospective on what that podcast used to be.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivemorethings.com/13">Five More Things Episode 13: Chainsaw Charles and Drilling Daddy-o</a>. Adam and Nathan talk Ben Affleck as Batman, and take apart the oft-cited suggestion that saying &#8220;no&#8221; is the simple cure-all key to success. Spoiler: it&#8217;s not, but tune in and let these two tell you why.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivemorethings.com/14">Five More THings Episode 14: Tesla, Web Experiments, and Launching New Business Ventures</a>. Adam and Nate talk Tesla, art, and then Nate unveils The Collective. A very interesting&#160;&#8212;&#160;albeit potentially slightly problematic in certain areas&#160;&#8212;&#160;idea that I look forward to hearing and seeing more of in the near future.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-06-28 08:47:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-06.html">06</a>/28 08:47:51 EST</time>
<p>The other day, as I drove home from work and practiced my dictation to the tune of Siri&#8217;s inept transcription abilities, I deftly tapped iMessages&#8217; &#8220;Send as Text Message&#8221; tooltip for what&#160;&#8212;&#160;given the number of text messages I send each month&#160;&#8212;&#160;must quite literally fall somewhere in the neighborhood of the millionth time. I tapped this button two or three times until, finally, my phone realized I wanted every outgoing message sent without the use of Apple&#8217;s clever and oh-so-convenient replacement. Then, as if to mock me, a few seconds later it switched back to sending everything as an iMessage. I just couldn&#8217;t win.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, and to a great degree recently, it seems, the utility of iMessage has become a hot-button issue for many in the tech press and its adjacent areas. In the experience of most, Apple&#8217;s text messaging replacement works like a charm: Jim Dalrymple often talks about having no issues with the service whatsoever. At the same time, however, a likely smaller but nevertheless disproportionally vocal faction&#160;&#8212;&#160;as is often the case on the internet&#160;&#8212;&#160;just can&#8217;t get the darn app to work with any semblance of consistency. As you may have guessed from the previous paragraph&#8217;s anecdote, I fall in the latter category: since my girlfriend got an iPhone and iMessage became a &#8220;viable&#8221; option, iMessage has stymied our efforts to remain connected and in touch with one another more times than I care to remember. And because she is by far and away the one person I talk to most through this medium, this unreliability has given iMessage such a bad name that I have all but sworn the app off and gone with a popular alternative like WhatsApp, for example, or another, similar service. The one thing that keeps me coming back, though, and simultaneously the greatest frustration I have nearly every single day, is the inconsistency: sometimes it works great, at other times it works well enough to pass muster, but it fails just often enough to imbue within me an incredible level of distrust I tend to reserve only for weathermen and technology analysts. To its credit, I must admit, at least it fails more consistently in certain situations than in others. If that sounds awkward and convoluted, that&#8217;s because everything about this is, and therein lies the root of my problem.</p>

<p>Of the near innumerable number of times iMessage fails me, it does so most often when either my girlfriend or I am away from home and thus away from a WiFi network. So long as both of us have a strong and stable WiFi connection, iMessage works reasonably well. Unfortunately though, WiFi is a luxury neither of us have for the majority of our days, which brings me back to the situation described at the top of this article where I battled with iMessage while on my way home earlier this week. &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; I asked myself. &#8220;How can I fix this?&#8221; Every time I leave home and my phone tries to intelligently send an iMessage, I end up locked in a loop of variable and possibly infinite length, just trying to tell my girlfriend &#8220;Hi&#8221;. Even before this thought had finished crossing my mind though, the solution hit me: geofenced iMessages.</p>

<p>Every problem I, and I would wager many others, too, have with iMessages comes down to a combination of the sender&#8217;s phone attempting to dispatch iMessages at inopportune times, and the recipient&#8217;s phone failing to inform the former&#8217;s device that all future messages should, in fact, get sent as text messages in order to ensure timely delivery. At least for me, those inopportune moments always occur when either I as the sender or my girlfriend as the recipient, or vise-versa, leave a certain location&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely, our respective homes. If only there was some way for me to say that I only wanted to allow my phone to send and receive iMessages within a certain radius of a given location, or only when connected to a WiFi network, every single one of my problems with this service would be immediately solved. Now, that&#8217;s not to say this is necessarily the best solution, nor even a good one. But all the iPhone users who read this, think of the times and places when iMessages has failed you; like me, I imagine there is at least a small degree of commonality between them, even if only a little. So while goefenced iMessages might not be the best or most elegant solution, it would solve all my problems, and I would bet every one of a great number of other people as well. And that&#8217;s what Apple is all about. really: solving problems and making technology approachable. Unfortunately, as it stands now, iMessages flies directly in the face of that driving goal.</p>

<p>From the day after Apple&#8217;s WWDC Keynote, Joe Steele took a refreshingly even-handed look at Swift, giving both the opinions of its proponents and opponents equal time, attention, and weight. And as if this were not enough, he included a number of astute observations and his causes for both concern and enthusiasm as well. If you, like me, have trouble staying abreast of tech news and thus have yet to read much about Swift, this is a great starting point.</p>

<p>I really have very little to say on the recent debate surrounding the future viability of podcast networks. To me, it seems a lot like the age-old flame wars comparing Macs and PCs, and the more recent and equally bombastic arguments over iOS versus Android: everyone has their own personal preference, and we must all accept that. Taken a step further, everyone has their own personal preference, we need to accept that, and no one will ever change another&#8217;s opinion; it cannot be done, for there is too much evidence supporting both sides of these embittered arguments for a group of any size to overcome, no matter the length or veracity of their case. Now, that all said, I do have a few thoughts I would like to share regarding the larger argument at hand&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, the discussion around creating good content and getting noticed, for I firmly believe that this&#160;&#8212;&#160;unlike its parent&#160;&#8212;&#160;is a worthy conversation to have.</p>

<p>The difficulty of creating something great is a thread that comes up a number of times in Marco Arment&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/06/22/podcast-networks-wrong-model">two</a> blog <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/06/23/elephant">posts</a>, <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/podcast-networks-live">Sid O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s response</a>, and <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2014/06/network-ing">Ben Brook&#8217;s article</a> on the same subject. These three writers vary in their opinion on the challenge creating a good podcast poses, with Marco presenting a strong case for it requiring very little effort, Sid at the opposite end of the spectrum, and Ben somewhere in between. On this account, I have to agree with Marco: as someone who has spent a fair amount of time looking to enter the podcasting space recently, I can corroborate his thesis that the barrier to entry in this medium has become low enough so as to hardly exist anymore. With a minimal investment of $8, I can make a home for my fledgling podcast at Squarespace that&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least aesthetically&#160;&#8212;&#160;can compete with the best of them; pair that with a quiet room and even a MacBook&#8217;s built-in microphone will produce a recording of decent quality provided you either play with GarageBand&#8217;s settings for a little bit or run it through something like Auphonic. Granted, this combination will not rival the quality of the shows Dan Benjamin produces at 5by5, but until you can aim for his level, your shows don&#8217;t have to rival those of 5by5; this is not a zero-sum game.</p>

<p>In terms of another medium very near and dear to all those participating in this conversation, the barrier to entry of starting a blog is even lower: that same $8 will net you a powerful site on Squarespace, Twitter accounts are free, and you can either write in Pages or TextEdit for literally nothing; take your pick of either one of those two or a fancy text editor like Sublime Text, and then start typing. An hour or two later though, the only thing separating your creation&#160;&#8212;&#160;regardless of medium&#160;&#8212;&#160;from overtaking Marco, John Siracusa, and Casey Liss&#8217; Accidental Tech Podcast, or John Gruber&#8217;s Daring Fireball, is the inherent interest your own thoughts and opinions possess. That, and the fact that no one will ever know you just recorded the most interesting, profound, impactful, and all-around greatest podcast the world will ever know, or wrote an epic that puts Homer&#8217;s The Odyssey to shame.</p>

<p>I have long held, although to my knowledge never stated publicly, that those at the top have a tendency to either romanticize their arduous climb, forget it completely, or suffer from some combination of both. All too often the answer to, &#8220;How can I get my work noticed?&#8221; is a rather reductive, &#8220;Work harder&#8221;, &#8220;Do good work&#8221;, or something similarly discouraging and unhelpful. No one likes to talk about the challenges left over after the hard work is done, but that does not mean they do not exist&#160;&#8212;&#160;far from it, actually. Starting from zero, count yourself lucky if you reach sixty in a year or two; for most, it will take much, much longer. If I had to guess, I would guess that this is the place from which most of the anger directed at Marco comes: us pawns sit here listening to Marco Arment&#160;&#8212;&#160;creator of Tumblr, Instapaper, The Magazine, and Adam Arment; host of Build &#38; Analyze, Neutral, and the Accidental Tech Podcast; and the guy who could, if some are to be believed, buy a yacht with his spoils whenever he so desires&#160;&#8212;&#160;talk about fame playing a relatively insignificant role in the overall success of an online venture, and we scoff. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221;, we say. We do more than scoff, though: we get angry; and where does that anger go? You can have one guess.</p>

<p>A more important question, however, does not seek to discern the ultimate target for our collective anger, but rather the validity of it: does he deserve this ludicrous level of hate? I say no, and I say so because&#160;&#8212;&#160;once again&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have to side with Marco here: an audience such as the impressively large one he, John, and Casey collectively command absolutely will help a show get off the ground; I would read, listen to, and buy anything any one of these three make, and I often do. This install base, however, as Marco attempted to explain in both his articles, does not guarantee continued success: if something he or any one of his companions makes does not pass muster, no one will have anything to do with it. As much as I like Marco, every time he writes about politics I close the tab, mark the feed item as read, and scroll past the tweet; I have no interest in anything he has to say on that front, and I would count myself amongst his biggest fans.</p>

<p>Just because Marco writes it does not mean I will come, nor does it mean the elusive &#8220;they&#8221; will come either: just as we all do, he has to make something great in order to see any significant return on that time investment. The only advantage Marco has over, say, me, when launching an app or writing an article is that some unknown number, X, people will see it for sure: after that, its ultimate success is completely predicated on its build quality and functionality. If I interviewed Marco on this site tomorrow, X people would see it&#160;&#8212;&#160;that X number that will follow him anywhere. And depending on how that interview went, some portion of that number would stick around: if I did poorly, that number would be near zero; otherwise, a potentially much larger portion might choose to stay. The same goes for podcasts and podcast networks: if I started a show on 5by5 tomorrow, by virtue of it being a 5by5 show, a certain number of people would tune in for the first episode or two&#160;&#8212;&#160;this is 5by5&#8217;s &#8220;X&#8221;. After that though, the onus is on me to create something great. But in reality, the onus was always on me to make something great.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sad to see tourism and capitalism ruining the way of life for a people whose traditions go back generations and hundreds of years. You might not agree with their beliefs, or may even go so far as to boldly proclaim the Amish lifestyle nothing more than a sham to avoid taxes; but regardless if your own personal opinions, I think we can all agree that this is unfortunate.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s often said, especially by those who profess to understand Apple on a fundamental level, that the company is not in the business of making strictly hardware or software, or even iPhones and Macs. However, although that realization comes readily enough, the gap it leaves explaining what, exactly, Apple does do if not build computers and operating systems, has proven elusive at best. After WWDC though, we have another great opportunity to inspect this underlying motivation, courtesy of Ben Alexander and Carl Holscher. Carl&#8217;s article is short, but that is because the point he makes is uncomplicated, and rightly so.</p>

<p>Another short list for you, unfortunately; apologies. I hope that before too long, I will be able to turn out the impressive rosters of days since past and once again shine my admittedly meager spotlight on some work truly worthy of recognition. Until then, though, I have but two recommendations for you:</p>

<p><a href="http://fivemorethings.com/8">Five More Things Episode 08: Are you crying? Yeah, You&#8217;re Crying</a>. Yet another great episode from a podcast I have enjoyed a great deal lately. In particular, Adam Haworth and Nathan Snelgrove had some very interesting observations as to what informs the behavior and priorities of a generation as a whole. A worthwhile listen if you have ever said &#8220;kids these days&#8221; in a non-ironic way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-114-the-gentlemans-b-party.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 114: The Gentleman&#8217;s B Party</a>. Growing up is hard already, but there are some things, some situations, and some decisions that can make it harder for some to turn out well than others. And then once you get there, once you reach adulthood, what&#8217;s the point? What is it that you will do to further humanity and make your life meaningful? Pursue greater wealth? And if so, to what end? Or, how about becoming a super villain? As Merlin pointed out, there are a lot of crazy things you could do with an island and enough money to make sure no one ever found out about it. More seriously though, a fantastic episode; definitely tune in for this one.</p>

<p>Until next week, then. And hopefully next time, I will have a few more suggestions for your listening pleasure.</p>

<p>Following Mike Monteiro&#8217;s recent announcement that he would effectively shutter Mule Radio Syndicate due to its untenable demand on his time, many wrote short farewells to what they considered a great podcast network. Marco Arment, however, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/05/29/mule-radio-pretty-much-dying">had something very interesting to say</a> regarding the future of this now-popular business model:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The glory days of podcast networks are behind us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a short quip, and to many, inconsequential. Nevertheless, as with most things even tangentially related to podcasts, I find it extremely interesting.</p>

<p>Traditionally, podcasts networks have consisted of many disparate shows spread across a wide spectrum of topics and produced by a diverse collection of hosts. Today, that is exactly what we see in giants like 5by5, for example. Historically, however, that has not been the case: irregardless of the current size or even the existence of a podcast network today, each invariably started as a collection of shows done by a single host on a relatively concentrated set of topics. Myke Hurley&#8217;s 70Decibels was comprised primarily of tech-centric shows, almost all of which he hosted before merging with 5by5. Similarly did 5by5 start, with Dan Benjamin co-hosting every show his network released. Both of these grew up to become very successful, but they did so because they were personality-driven: everyone tuned in to hear Mike Hurley, and everyone tuned in to hear Dan Benjamin. Had 70Decibels persisted, there is no doubt in my mind that it would have continued gaining in popularity. And 5by5, well, it speaks for itself these days. They would not have continued growing, and do not continue growing, respectively, increasingly popular because of that personality anymore though, but rather because they have quite literally become too big to fail: their base of appeal is too large to do anything but succeed anymore. With such a large spread of shows on so many different topics, 5by5 appeals to too large an audience to fade into irrelevance today.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, we have podcast networks like Constellation by Fiat Lux popping up and following a similar trajectory as both 70Decibels and 5by5 did once upon a time. And like both 5by5 and 70Decibels, Constellation is largely personality-driven, although it is worthwhile to note that Fiat Lux also seeks to differentiate itself on its divergent approach to this medium. So while I think Marco is correct in saying that the glory days of podcast networks are over, I feel it is worthwhile to make a distinction between groups relying on a vast roster of shows and thus a wide base of appeal to keep them afloat, and those seeking to make themselves known and successful through their hosts&#8217; unique personality. Because we will always have room for another of the latter, even if the glory days of the former are past.</p>

<p>At any given time I have a multi-tool, both phillips and flathead screwdrivers, a small survival kit, and a large pocket knife on my person, plus&#160;&#8212;&#160;obviously&#160;&#8212;&#160;a wallet with enough cash to get me out of most situations in which that would be of any help. In my car, I keep a blanket and enough paracord to erect a small shelter, along with a number of other items that would prove quite useful in a number of different situations. And, of course, jumper cables. Ninety-nine percent of the time I will use none of these, but I wouldn&#8217;t dream of leaving the house without any of then. And boy, when I actually do need any of these tools, they sure do come in handy.</p>

<p>Fantastic, even-handed look at the often politically-charged debate surrounding gun control in America. I personally believe, like Adam Weinstein, that everyone deserves to protect themselves with the tool that they deem appropriate. However, he does raise quite a few great points and asks a number of very difficult questions that have made me really examine my point of view on this subject like no other piece of this genre ever has. And that, regardless of which side of the issue you fall on, is real, tangible progress. About time.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-06-15 19:36:23-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-06.html">06</a>/15 19:36:23 EST</time>
<p>I coded all morning in a determined effort to finish a long-standing project I intend to write about soon. Although I planned to spend only a short while on this before moving to other things, I ended up using the majority of my afternoon to finally, after months of work, just about make this script feature-complete. It was not something I had planned to do, nor was it particularly enjoyable&#160;&#8212;&#160;in fact, at times I grew quite frustrated with my lack of progress, and often thought of quitting. But I plugged away at it, and now I am one step closer to finishing this project as well.</p>

<p>Then, this afternoon when I sat down to do some reading, I happened across Matt Gemmell&#8217;s article <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/staying-creative"><em>Staying Creative</em></a>, where he talked about&#160;&#8212;&#160;you guessed it&#160;&#8212;&#160;the challenge of staying creative particularly in professions that demands constant and inventive output.</p>

<p>This is where I make my confession, I suppose, the spot where I tell you that I did not read his entire article before I started writing this. I did later, after I finished here, but just reading the beginning was enough to prompt me to write this. It was not out of laziness that I neglected to finish his piece before beginning work here though, but rather because I just couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling that the entire creativity racket is just that: a socially-accepted racket in which creative types can comfortably wax on about their perceived inability to sit down and actually do work, and then come up with new and inventive ways of overcoming their wholly self-imposed barriers. Framed in that light, how could I possibly stomach continuing? And so I did not.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I liked reading the article from Shawn Blanc that Matt pointed to in his aforecited essay: that and his other recent works in the same vein truly are worth reading because they get to the heart of creativity&#8217;s greatest opponents. What&#8217;s more, one of the biggest reasons I stuck with Back to Work in its early days was because I enjoyed hearing Merlin and Dan talk about productivity and, by extension, the creativity becoming proficient in this former area permits you to attain in the rest of your life. I have, admittedly, found a great deal of enjoyment in exploring this subject&#8217;s many facets in the past. Lately, however, I have become increasingly more disenchanted with this genre&#8217;s often unfulfilled promises.</p>

<p>This morning, I didn&#8217;t want to spend my entire afternoon coding: I wanted to sit down and read, and I really wanted to write. I have not written seriously in a long time. But as I got into it, despite the tedium and the frustration, writing Python gradually became what I wanted to do, and after that point I no longer felt any compulsion to stop. And then later this afternoon, reading became what I wanted to do, and so I read. Shortly thereafter, I stopped reading because writing became what I wanted to do, and then I wrote this. Are you starting to notice a trend? With the exception of reading, my other two activities are very much creative, and ones that are most often associated with the oft-cited challenges so many deign to write about in their creativity diatribes. Yet today, like most days, I had no trouble not just fitting them in, but spending hours upon hours doing each as well.</p>

<p>Why? I&#8217;m not a productivity guru&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;m no Merlin Mann, let me assure you, and I have relegated GTD<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to little more than an interesting concept inapplicable in my own life; I&#8217;m just some 19-year-old kid living in Ohio who likes to write prose and Python. So what makes me unique? Why can I consistently do something that so many intelligent people apparently cannot?</p>

<p>As I searched for an intelligent and succinct way to answer that question, I thought back to Shawn Blanc&#8217;s notion of every dollar he earned having a job. In other words, there are no extra dollars: some portion goes to bills, another to food, and still another to entertainment and similarly jovial pursuits. And in the end, every dollar is both important and accounted for. But while he starts out every month by allotting a certain, fixed amount to each area of his life, he does not prescribe that a certain number of dollars must be spent in any one area. Put another way, he does not necessarily have to spend $300 on entertainment even though he may set aside that much for this one job; he could spend any number under that, but nothing over. it is in a similar way that I manage my time:</p>

<p>I start out every day knowing that I will spend eight hours working, one hour in the gym, and a combined half an hour traveling to and from the gym and showering afterwards. I must also spend between seven and eight hours sleeping if I want to make it through my day without constantly struggling to stay awake. Allowing for some elasticity in that schedule, and for simplicity sake, round that to 17 hours accounted for automatically. After that, I have seven hours to split between my various other pursuits. A maximum of seven hours but&#160;&#8212;&#160;obviously&#160;&#8212;&#160;no more. So on any given day, I could spend those seven hours reading, writing, programming, or on something else. And here&#8217;s the key: most of the time, it doesn&#8217;t matter to me whether I spend seven hours reading, seven hours writing, seven hours programming, seven hours doing something else, or some combination of those four: I can rest securely in the knowledge that when the time comes, when writing (or reading or programming or something else) is really something that I want to do, I will do just that, for just as long as I want to, and nothing else. That is exactly what happened today, after all, and I will end the day having finished a massive coding project and written more than 1100 words to boot. The proof is in the pudding, as they say.</p>

<p>In my life, personal productivity factors into my daily equation nowhere, because it is irrelevant: I allot my precious seven hours based on what I want to do and what I feel like doing only; I don&#8217;t try to pigeonhole three of those hours into reading, two of those hours into writing, and one hour into programming. To do that, I firmly believe, is to pursue a fool&#8217;s errand. What kind of results can you expect when your heart is not in it? Some days just aren&#8217;t writing days, and I have learned to not only accept that, but to be okay with that as well. Perhaps that&#8217;s why everyone has such a hard time with productivity and creativity: maybe it&#8217;s not your system, your OmniFocus mind map, or your hand-crafted to-do list that is the problem, but instead you yourself and the real desires you continually push below the surface. Allow yourself time to pursue the creative avenues you truly wish to explore secure in the knowledge that when it truly is time to write, that is what you will do. I do, and it works great for me.</p>

<p>A remarkably short list for you this week, if it even deserves such a title as &#8220;list&#8221; with only two members. But, nevertheless, it does contain the two best podcast episodes I encountered over the last seven days. So enjoy, and maybe this weekend spend a little less time with headphones in your ears.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/roderick-on-the-line-episode-113:-big-comedy-rock-solo.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 113: Big Comedy Rock Solo</a>. I had almost given up on adding this episode when John and Merlin entered the second half of their ninety minute show with some fantastic observations and insights first into feminism and then, later, conspiracy theories and communism. Fascinating and although undoubtedly controversial, they made perfect sense; I absolutely agree with everything they said.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/061-taming-wifi-with-bradley-chambers">Technical Difficulties Episode 61: Taming WiFi with Bradley Chambers</a>. Interesting and informative discussion on what I readily admit is little more than a black box to me. If you want to improve your own home&#8217;s WiFi, or just want a better understanding of the technology, you could do much worse than starting here.</p>

<p>By far and away the best article from Ben Thompson in quite some time, reminiscent of his past <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/newspapers-are-dead-long-live-journalism/">three-part series on the future of news and newspapers</a>. I have paid too little attention to this issue to have formed any sort of opinion on it, but based on this piece I would agree with Ben: it seems like book publishers made a ill-fated deal, Amazon has come to collect, and it&#8217;s far too late to go back on it now.</p>

<p>If you have never tried cooking with cast iron, you and everyone that has ever eaten with you are missing out: with the exception of boiling water, every single dish you can think of cooked with a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven turns out better than when made with a utensil of inferior materials, and everything is inferior to cast iron when it comes to cooking. Forget stainless steel, non-stick, and everything else: nothing holds a candle to this material. That&#8217;s why I, personally, cook everything in a cast iron pan, and wouldn&#8217;t even think of using anything else. So do yourself a favor and pick one of these up; I promise, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

<p>This article reminds of Rocky IV, when Rocky Balboa prepared to fight on behalf of the U.S. against The USSR&#8217;s Ivan Drago by running in the snow, doing push-ups, and lifting bundles of rocks while his opponent used steroids and the most advanced training practices. Yet in the end, Rocky still won: hard, grueling exercises, both then and now, prevailed over the finicky, artisanal workouts that have become so popular as of late. If you have not yet gotten the results you want, the culprit may very well be the actual workout itself.</p>

<p>A few days ago <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-magic-of-wwdc.html">I asked</a> if those who speak out critically of the attention WWDC garners changed their opinions with last week&#8217;s impressive roster of announcements; looks like it changed at least one person&#8217;s mind, and rightfully so. Adam&#8217;s more favorable opinion of WWDC is not the only noteworthy aspect of this piece, however: I believe he hit the nail squarely on the head when describing Apple&#8217;s current and future relationship with Google by way of these innovations as well. In short, it will be an amicable partnership no more. Apple has yet to fully realize Steve Jobs&#8217; promise of going thermonuclear on Android, but they have been hard at work building the warheads behind closed doors up until now, of which we only got occasional glimpses here and there in the form of iOS 6 and then iOS 7. Now, though, the missiles have been wheeled out into full view, and I might even go so far as to argue primed and ready for launch. They say the only way to win is not to play, but in this case, I&#8217;m not so sure; personally, I&#8217;d put money on Apple.</p>

<p>A few days ago, shortly after watching the WWDC keynote, I made a short quip <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/474021292484866048">on Twitter</a> that went completely unnoticed at the time: &#8220;Posit: Apple doesn&#8217;t need to build low-end phones: it has Android.&#8221; I expected to get some pushback on that statement, and so partly because I did not and partly because I believe it an observation worth exploring, I have decided to expand upon it today.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Apple has almost completely captured the high-end smartphone market, leaving the mid-range and low-end segments to, primarily, Samsung. For quite a while, that worked out great for both companies: Apple took the majority of the industry&#8217;s profits, and Samsung took the majority of its market share. The problem came in, however, when churn entered the equation: by virtue of the two companies&#8217; positions in the market, Android users always had to weigh the attractive proposition of upgrading to an iPhone against any dissatisfaction experienced over the duration of their contract. And even if they were completely satisfied with their Android experience, the prospect of upgrading is no less compelling&#160;&#8212;&#160;even to a layperson. Dissatisfied iPhone users have a similar opportunity, except downgrading is a much less attractive proposition than its opposite&#160;&#8212;&#160;much less attractive, even, than simply waiting for the device&#8217;s next iteration, which is the course of action I imagine most in this situation take. And so gradually at first and then with greater speed as of late, Android has started bleeding users that Apple subsequently picks up. The same process occurs in the iOS ecosystem, it is important to note, but whereas Android is now losing users faster than it is gaining them, the opposite is true for Apple. It is the natural function of a healthy market for all those within it to eventually attain the best of a commodity that they can for their money, and that is exactly what we see here.</p>

<p>Many recommend Apple enter the low-end as a way to capture some of the mid- to low-end that Samsung currently dominates, and to provide a way in to the Apple experience at a lower price. But, to put it quite simply, Apple has absolutely no need to either target those market segments or make it any easier to enter this ecosystem: as Tim Cook explained during the keynote, Android users are flocking to iOS in search of a better experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;a better life&#8221;; in coming to iOS, they have completed a journey full of unsatisfactory experiences. Why would Apple ever want to be a part of that?</p>

<p>WWDC has come and gone, and in its wake Apple has left us a number of great analytical shows discussing the implications of its announcements. Podcasts on this subject are not the only ones you will find here, though: this week, as always, I have something for everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/crush/2">Crush on Radio Episode 02: The Sad Beautiful Fact</a>. Richard Anderson of <a href="http://www.sanspoint.com">Sanspoint</a> had Patrick Rhone on to talk about the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. As was the case when Rich and Merlin dove into a lengthy discussion of The Wrens, I had never heard of this production before; and just as I still ended up enjoying Rich and Merlin&#8217;s talk immensely, so too did I find this conversation surprisingly interesting. These shows are so remarkably well done, though, so how could I not?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/10">Cultivate Episode 10: We Wouldn&#8217;t Have The Mac If We Didn&#8217;t Have The Apple I</a>. From the time when making inflammatory declarations as to what did and did not constitute a good podcast was (quite literally, in some cases) all the rage, Jamie and Ben took an even-handed approach to the subject and then used it as a way in to talking about actually creating the thing you want to see rather than simply complaining about its absence. Very valuable advice regardless of how far along you are towards your creative goals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/12">Cultivate Episode 12: All I Want to Do is Make You Happy</a>. Fantastic talk between Jamie Ryan, Ben Alexander, and Andrew Clark of The Menu Bar and Numerical on actually buckling down to get real work done, and how carrying definitions of success can determine whether or not the same outcome is perceived as a failure or the success it just might be. Once again, a valuable episode for anyone in the creative professions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/15">Cultivate Episode 15: Maybe They Can Both be True</a>. Ben and Jamie discuss the then-hot issue of sponsorships and impartiality amongst podcasters and writers, sharing many insights that I wish were more prevalent amongst the people who most often talk about these things. Also, turns out no one in podcasting makes any money.</p>

<p><a href="http://podbay.fm/show/536258179/e/1401595200?autostart=1">Welcome to Night Vale Episode 48: Rennovations</a>. I described the last episode of this show as &#8220;haunting&#8221;, and this time around I would  use the word &#8220;euphoric&#8221;: oddly enough, for some reason that is exactly what I felt as Cecil regained his rightful place at the helm of Nightvale&#8217;s one and only independent organization not under the control of Strexcorp, and the city&#8217;s citizens finally began to recognize their oppressive overlords for what they really are. I haven&#8217;t looked forward to the next episode of a podcast as much as I&#8217;m looking forward to episode #49 in quite some time; this is truly one of the best podcasts currently broadcasting, and easily the greatest of the fiction genre. So great.</p>

<p><a href="http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-23-maximum-erasability">Pragmatic Episode 23: Maximum Erasability</a>. John Chidgey and Seth Clifford take a deep dive into the world of collaboration through whiteboards and this medium&#8217;s extensive history. A nod back to the exhaustive detail and historical perspective that made me so find of Pragmatic in the beginning; it&#8217;s great to see John moving back towards those roots.</p>

<p><a href="http://a16z.com/2014/06/02/a16z-podcast-the-apple-wwdc-2014-deep-dive/">The a16z Podcast: The Apple WWDC 2014 Deep Dive</a>. Detailed and succinct overview of this week&#8217;s WWDC Keynote address as well as its ripple effects, courtesy of Benedict Evans and Dave Jagoda. I actually had not seen the keynote when I listen to this episode, so I can say from first-hand experience that it truly is a great place to start if, for some reason, you can&#8217;t devote two hours to watching the keynote.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-38-wwdc-2014-developer-roundtable">Debug Episode 38: WWDC 2014 developer roundtable</a>. By my measure the best WWDC coverage to come out last week, with ATP Episode 68, <a href="http://atp.fm/68">Siracusa Waited Impatiently for This</a>, a close second and The Prompt Episode 51, <a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/51">Developer Christmas</a>, coming in third. Myke, Federico, and Stephen had no intention of covering everything announced during the keynote in this one episode though, so I expect this ranking to change in the coming weeks as they expand their focus. <a href="http://fivemorethings.com/16">We&#8217;re Getting Geeky</a> from Five More THings was also pretty good, but definitely geared towards a less technically-minded crowd. So much so, in fact, that I completely dismissed it the first time around as so out of touch to be completely unlistenable and wholly unworthy of my time. Come for the Apple news, then, but stay for the other topics.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon, at the tail end of a jam-packed and incredible keynote, Craig Federighi introduced yet another &#8220;kit&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;HomeKit. Continuing an impressive trend present throughout the presentation, this framework makes your entire house an accessory to the iPhone in iOS 8 by allowing those with compatible systems to control everything from security cameras and door locks to lights and, although not explicitly stated, other devices such as thermostats too. Unsurprisingly, the feedback I have seen thus far has remained universally positive: if not the utility of such an advancement, everyone recognizes the implications of Apple tying so many once-disparate systems together into a single, usable, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;most importantly&#160;&#8212;&#160;enjoyable system. Completely absent from this commentary, however, is any discussion of privacy or even the notion that giving Apple so many hooks into one&#8217;s personal life could, at some point, become a concern.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>Google got raked over the coals for buying Nest, a thermostat manufacturer, that could not have given Google much more personal information than its owner&#8217;s preferred climate settings. Perhaps these settings could have allowed Google to infer other things such as when the house went unoccupied, for example, but those suppositions would have remained just that: guesses. Yet Apple, that will soon not only have access to, but control as well, quite literally every aspect of a house&#160;&#8212;&#160;including the thermostat, ironically&#160;&#8212;&#160;has received quite literally zero criticism. Those assumptions Google could guess at but yet never quite confirm, Apple could prove with a simple algorithm watching a webcam feed or by connecting with a security system. Incredible&#160;&#8212;&#160;yes, but at the same time, a completely justifiable seemingly double standard.</p>

<p>Essentially, it comes down to Google having every incentive to track every single aspect of a given individual&#8217;s life so that they can, ultimately, serve up more targeted and thus more valuable advertising. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/social-success.html">As I explained previously</a>, Google+ was built in service of that goal: rather than the Facebook competitor the public immediately painted it, Google+ allowed Google to better identify, track, and target individual users with a specificity previously exclusive to Facebook. Apple, on the other hand, has but one incentive: to create outstanding user experiences so that they can, ultimately, properly compel you to purchase the next iteration of their hit product and, over time, become more involved in the Apple ecosystem. It is this very disparity in motivation that makes the former creepy and the latter comforting, and the single most important reason I would have no problem inviting Apple into my home, but would only extend a similar invitation to Google with significant reticence.</p>

<p>As I catch up on missed articles, I came across this noteworthy one from Adam Haworth&#8217;s <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/change-is-inevitable.html">previously-mentioned</a> Sansink, where he talks about fanboyism and WWDC. Worth reading, I believe, especially in the wake of Monday&#8217;s spectacular keynote address, because I think his point of view mirrors that of all but the relatively small sect who get genuinely enthused around this time each year: for most of the computer-using world, WWDC is an over-hyped and ultimately disappointing event specifically for overzealous hipsters with too much time and money on their hands. In light of the nature and magnitude of Apple&#8217;s latest announcements, however, I would be curious to know whether he&#160;&#8212;&#160;and all those who hold this and similar opinions&#160;&#8212;&#160;now feel at all different, for what we saw on that Monday afternoon truly was groundbreaking, and I firmly believe that one does not have to be an Apple fanboy&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even involved in the ecosystem, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;to appreciate these impressive announcements; WWDC truly was worth the excitement. It may only be technology, but it will absolutely change the world.</p>

<p>Stories like this one from Craig Grannell remind me why I have been so reticent to enter the political landscape in any meaningful capacity up until now, a hesitancy <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/net-neutrality-wake-call/">I outlined when linking to Ben Thompson&#8217;s recent piece</a> in which he called for greater political involvement for those in the technical professions. Everyone promises peace and to bring the soldiers home, but that will never happen: wars will forever wage on, and someone will always need stopped. The key difference between Craig&#8217;s story and reality, though, is not the tactics or actions of the system&#8217;s participants, but rather the end result when they invariably and inevitably fail to fulfill their promises: whereas his classmates held him and his cohorts accountable on the schoolyard, modern-day citizens&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Americans in particular, it seems&#160;&#8212;&#160;have no interest in holding anyone accountable for the promises on which they renege.</p>

<p>Fascinating short documentary done by Motherboard on Soylent. Since it came out I have been a somewhat vocal proponent of this product, but remained so only in theory: through this site I readily recommended others try Soylent every time I wrote about it, but never actually gave it a shot myself. After seeing this, though, I have finally decided to bite the bullet and order some: I&#8217;ll start with the original Soylent, and then, depending on how that goes, maybe even dabble in creating my own over at <a href="http://diy.soylent.me">DIY.soylent.me</a>. Either way though, I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Yet another great article from Sam Dogen over at Financial Samurai. Although I have considered unsubscribing from his site a number of times lately, for it seems that overnight his posts went from the single most interesting writing I could find on the internet to the most boring, he really hit it out of the park with this one: simultaneously excellent, rage-inducing, and depressing all at once. Especially in these socially-charged times we live in today, I would highly recommend this piece to anyone regardless of whether they have any interest in furthering their financial prowess. And if you, like me, maintain interests in both these areas, I have no doubt that you will grow to appreciate Sam&#8217;s work just as much as I do.</p>

<p>I subscribed to Adam Haworth&#8217;s site on a lark, and thus far doing so has proven a remarkably prescient decision. If you&#8217;re looking for another great site to start following, start with this piece on change and thank me later.</p>

<p>Thought-provoking piece by Ben Thompson wherein he explains the importance of those within the technical professions getting involved  in the morass that is politics. In the past I have taken zero interest in this whatsoever: despite turning eighteen just before the last presidential election, I did not vote; I have yet to even register. But Ben makes a strong case for greater involvement, and one that I feel will, ultimately, prove not only the best course of action, but the only viable one for a bright future.</p>

<p>In preparation for Apple&#8217;s WWDC keynote today, be sure to give Harshil Shah&#8217;s article wherein he lays out his wishes for iOS 8 a try: although I&#8217;m only about halfway through, in the interest of time I have decided to post it here anyway. He makes a lot of great points, and has some very interesting ideas for the future of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system. It just might take you until the beginning of the keynote to finish, but I highly recommend you check this piece out. And if you want to read even more about some iOS 8 expectations, I posted my own list a few weeks ago: <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/looking-to-ios-8.html">Looking to iOS 8</a>.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-06-01 20:16:54-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-06.html">06</a>/01 20:16:54 EST</time>
<p>Almost exclusively old shows this week with but two outstanding exceptions. Turns out listening to back catalogs pays off; who would&#8217;ve guessed?</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/039-writing-technical-ebooks-with-brett-kelly">Technical Difficulties Episode 39: Writing Technical eBooks with Brett Kelly</a>. Gabe Weatherhead and Erik Hess recorded a very enjoyable interview with the writer of the popular Evernote Essentials, where they talked about&#160;&#8212;&#160;among other things&#160;&#8212;&#160;Brett&#8217;s approach to the writer&#8217;s craft. Such a nice, refreshing chat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/pilot">Cultivate: Introducing Cultivate with Jamie Ryan</a>. Fantastic first episode where Ben Alexander and Jamie Ryan explained what we could expect from their podcast going forward, after which the two delved into a spectacular discussion about the tech news racket from the perspective of those writing within it, the companies involved, and the reader as well. By far and away the best insights into this subject I have ever had the privilege of hearing. This will be one episode that I will undoubtedly return to many times over, and I highly recommend you do as well: I have no doubt in my mind that this episode will stand the test of time much, much longer than the articles and think pieces of which it offers such salient critiques. An excellent start to what I have no doubt will prove an excellent show.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/2013/11/19/the-british-invasion">Cultivate: The British Invasion</a>. Interesting chat with Engadget&#8217;s Associate European Editor Matt Brian about U.S.-centric tech journalism through the lens of the site&#8217;s then-recent redesign, cable and cellular networks, and Android devices. A great follow-up to their introductory episode that definitely fulfilled its promises.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/2013/12/6/attack-of-the-drones">Cultivate: Attack of the Drones</a>. Sometimes it can be tough listening to a podcast&#8217;s back catalog, with all the news and talking points so outdated and all, but that was in no way the case here where Ben and Jamie used Amazon&#8217;s then-recent announcement of delivery by drone as a way in to the topic of this move&#8217;s potential privacy implications.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/pulling-the-string/31">Pulling the String Episode 31: This Can Live Forever</a>. Very interesting discussion between Ben Alexander of Fiat Lux and Constellation, and Jeff Ruberg of Podigious on the current and future state of podcasts, and what that term means and could grow to mean in the not to distant future. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a fan of Podigious, unfortunately, although I have given it quite a few tries, but Jeff seems like a great guy with a lot of neat ideas. He and Ben make a great pair.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/117">The Critical Path Episode 117: Why Did Apple Buy Beats?</a>. Prior to the official announcement of Apple&#8217;s acquisition of Beats, Horace Dediu and Mois&#233;s Chiullan shared some prescient insights into the reasoning behind this move. I still have a hard time caring, at least at this point, but even I could realize the value in this discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/50">The Prompt Episode 50: All the Little Ridges</a>. Recorded just after Apple&#8217;s official announcement, Myke, Federico, and Stephen spent a great deal of time discussion this acquisition. Come for the topic at hand, but stay for the slightly less serious&#160;&#8212;&#160;when compared to the tone of The Critical Path, at least&#160;&#8212;&#160;yet equally insightful analysis.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/4">The Secret Chromebook Plumber</a>. Jamie explains the anatomy of a Scottish brawl, then the two talk about Chromebooks and the increasing relevance of low end devices. Also, why you can&#8217;t believe everything you read on the internet, whether it&#8217;s an outrageous event or an Apple rumor. It&#8217;s after episodes like these in particular that I feel especially sad that this show ended after so few episodes.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-30 07:13:07-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/30 07:13:07 EST</time>
<p>Shortly after Marco Arment and Dan Benjamin started <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build &#38; Analyze</a> in 2010, I bought Instapaper. I did not buy this app out of any particular need for it, though, but rather out of a desire to give Marco a little something in exchange for the hours upon hours of enjoyment he had provided me in the form of his podcast. Fast-forward just a few months, however, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;just as I do now&#160;&#8212;&#160;I had begun to use Instapaper daily. Even so, it took me nearly four years&#160;&#8212;&#160;until just a few weeks ago, in fact&#160;&#8212;&#160;to realize that the true value of this service did not lie in its ability to strip away ads and annoying sidebars nor even keep my saved articles available for reading offline, nor did its value stem from its intended use case as a way to time-shift the reading experience. Instead, I found Instapaper incredibly handy because of the psychological tricks it lets me play on myself.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, I have spent a great deal of time curating the list of people and websites I permit to command my time in any meaningful way: I only subscribe to about thirty-five RSS feeds, and thus far I have managed to keep the number of people I follow on Twitter down to a manageable forty-two. Although this means I do not have to live in Reeder and Tweetbot, it also imbues everything I see from this relatively small number of sources with an indelible sense of importance: this article came from one of these few writers whom I have elevated above all the rest, and so therefore I must read it, as it is most assuredly of great import. Even as I say this I realize the fallacy in my reasoning, but it nevertheless plays out in this way time and time again. Obviously, though, I do not have enough time to read everything that crosses my path. And so I often go through my day with some level of guilt at having ignored what my brain constantly reminds me could have been an exceptional piece had I only taken the time to read it.</p>

<p>Instapaper effectively silences that voice: thanks to Instapaper, I can send every hot-topic article of any remote interest to me over to this generic bin, where it resides for a few days as I work my way through a lengthy back-catalog of articles saved during the previous days and weeks. The true value of Instapaper, though, as I said earlier, does not lie simply in this ability it affords me, but rather in the ability it gives me to cull that list with the wisdom permitted by a somewhat lengthy remove. In this way, I can send ten articles about the Beats acquisition over to Instapaper and then, when I realize that I have absolutely zero interest in this topic, delete them all without any guilt: I have fulfilled the implicit contract I made in my head with these writers, and thus now I feel free to manage these works based purely on their merit rather than anything else.</p>

<p>This is the single most valuable aspect of Instapaper, to me, and the reason I love this service so much. I realize Pocket and Readability and the numerous other contenders could do this just as well, but I have grown quite fond of Marco&#8217;s brainchild over the years, and so that is where I will stay.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-28 14:40:07-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/28 14:40:07 EST</time>
<p>A lot has been said regarding women in tech as of late, and in general I hate every one of those articles; I don&#8217;t care for them in the least: they critique a broken system without offering a tangible solution outside of a weary call to action, and thus affect virtually no change whatsoever. Most importantly though, they are universally boring: I want to gouge my eyes out rather than read through to an inevitable and maddeningly boring conclusion that, in reality, merits such a designation purely out of its location in the body of prose rather than by its merit or as a result of its ability to put forth an answer to the academic queries &#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; or &#8220;Where do we go from here?&#8221; The irony is not lost on me, then, that today I have sat down to write one of these detestable essays. I can, however, take solace in the fact that unlike the vast majority of writers who approach this subject, I have no intention of handling it delicately and only while wearing kid gloves; as I told Sid O&#8217;Neill <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/469940477429809153">the other day on Twitter</a>, &#8220;Call it like it is, don&#8217;t hedge, and don&#8217;t sugarcoat it&#160;&#8212;&#160;that&#8217;s the way to go.&#8221; I did not sit down today to write and not offend anyone, and to maintain everyone&#8217;s comfortability: too little is accomplished in service of maintaining the status quo in these areas. And on top of that I do, in fact, have an actual solution.</p>

<p>I suppose I have one more thing in which I can take pride, the fact that I have the courage to utter this admittedly provocative statement knowing full well that it will instantly infuriate many: women in tech annoy me. That declaration is not in and of itself the problem, though&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;m calling it like it is, so please try to see past your blind entitlement and self-righteous anger to hear me out&#160;&#8212;&#160;but rather the result, and the causes of that result are the places we ought to inspect, criticize, and change. Telling an overweight person that they look great might be the nice thing to do, and might make them feel good, and might keep everyone in the room happy, but it won&#8217;t change the fact that he or she will wake up in a month after a heart attack; being nice and pulling my punches is helping no one in either our hypothetical scenario or this all too real one. At some point, then, it becomes imperative that we address concrete issues in order to move forward towards fixing the underlying causes; today we have reached that point, and so I will say it once more: &#8220;women in tech annoy me.&#8221; But even so, even in service of attempting to kick-start meaningful progress in this area, why would I say something so intentionally inflammatory?</p>

<p>On one level, I chose to write that sentence even though I will undoubtedly receive a great deal of flak for it because I think we as a community <em>need</em> to get angry in order to rally behind a single banner. In the absence of that belief, I would have taken the middle road everyone else does, chipping away and sanding my cactus of an opinion down until it completely lacked the ability to elicit any emotional response. Perhaps, as <a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-004-technology-and-politics/">Ben Thompson and James Allworth have put forth recently</a> on their podcast Exponent, the apparent existence of a hard and fast ignition point that can be approached time and time again without consequence so long as the issue and question does not cross the sacred line in the sand is a fundamental problem to the tech community that ought to be fixed; for today, however, that is not the issue I wish to tackle, but rather a flaw I seek to exploit in service of furthering my ultimate point. Because all too many of these so-called calls to actions are actually nothing more than obligatory retrospectives condemning the actions of either a company or an individual rather than the call to arms many of these articles pass themselves off as, and that we so desperately need. So get mad, and if that means getting angry at me, then so be it&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I implore you, read this to the end, and then decide if your anger ought to come to my feet in strongly-worded 140 character bursts on Twitter or, instead, ought to go towards affecting&#160;&#8212;&#160;here&#8217;s that word again&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>meaningful</em> change. Because we do need to change, because in saying that women in tech annoy me, I was being completely honest; and thus we have my secondary motive to uttering such heresy.</p>

<p>Every time I see a podcast episode appear in which one of my favorite hosts interviews a female guest, I get hopeful. Call me a sexist, but I have found that women are either as interesting or, often, more interesting than their male counterparts. And so, whenever a female appears on one of my favorite shows, I look forward to that episode perhaps slightly more than I would normally. I will not call out individuals here, though, and designate certain individuals as particularly interesting or enjoyable to hear, for to do so would not only hurt those not mentioned but also let those I do designate stand back with their noses turned up in the belief that what I say here does not apply to them. I refuse to name specific individuals, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I said&#160;&#8212;&#160;when I see certain names pop up that I have only heard spoken in somewhat reverent tones up until then, I feel instantaneously hopeful. But then the show starts, and I begin to hear a nervous laugh every few sentences, the guest rambles, and the show goes steadily downhill as it becomes less about the topic at hand and more about a woman involved in tech. I am filled only with disappointment now, because the show I felt so excited to play turned in to nothing more than an hour of petty justification, of someone attempting to prove herself to the world and justify her existence not only on this show, but within the tech space as well. And I <em>hate</em> that with a burning passion&#160;&#8212;&#160;I hate listening to these needy, &#8220;I can do this thing too, except maybe even better because&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this is rarely stated, but goes unsaid as the hosts dance around the elephant in the room&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;I am a woman&#8221; shows. I despise that desire to prove oneself among anyone young or old, male or female, white or black, but over time I have found it especially prevalent amongst women in tech. And so every time I listened to one of these shows, I would think about writing this article; and today, I finally decided to just so that I could plead&#160;&#8212;&#160;beg&#160;&#8212;&#160;that you women out there writing code and building huge open source projects, and writing prose at massive, widely-read publications, and doing all those other jobs that I don&#8217;t even know exist, that you would all just stop trying to prove yourself at every turn.</p>

<p>I, honestly, could not care less if you are a woman: if you have something interesting to say, or do something interesting with your life, then I will read what you have to say and stick around to hear about your job just as I would with anyone else; that is a decision I make irrespective of gender. I have no interest in listening to you tacitly explain your value over and over again. I realize that the tech community is to blame for this, because for all too long it has been an industry dominated by men who look down on women and thus make them feel that they need to constantly prove themselves&#160;&#8212;&#160;I get that. Those are the systemic causes I spoke of earlier, the ones that we ought to inspect, criticize and change, that led me to my remark of &#8220;women in tech annoy me&#8221;. But how about instead of capitulating, rather than caving to the demands that you constantly justify yourself in a way that your peers need not, how about just doing good work and letting it speak for itself?</p>

<p>Women in tech annoy me&#160;&#8212;&#160;of that, I believe I have made myself quite clear if in no way other than my incessant overuse of the phrase. But would you like to know who do not annoy me? People who do interesting things&#160;&#8212;&#160;not men who do interesting things, but <em>people</em>. That is a very nuanced distinction, but also an incredibly important one. I do not care in the least if you are a man or woman; do something interesting, and I will take note. Justify yourself a thousand times, however, and regardless of your gender, you will forever be lost to me. It&#8217;s unseemly and, quite frankly, disgusting to interact with someone whose every word belies an ulterior motive so shallow as justifying their involvement in a particular space. I hate that, and I highly doubt that I am the only one who feels this way. It&#8217;s about time you stopped speaking, then, and let your work speak for itself. You do not annoy me because you are a woman in tech; in reality, you annoy me because of what that self-identification has made you become. Change that, and so too will my enthusiasm for your work change as well. Until then, though, I cannot see how you expect to affect any change whatsoever: change must come from both within yourself and from outside of yourself in equal measures. As of today, though, we are only halfway there; it&#8217;s time for an introspection.</p>

<p>Another short week, unfortunately. Short, but no less excellent&#160;&#8212;&#160;of that, I can assure you. So sit back, relax on your day off tomorrow, and enjoy last week&#8217;s best podcasts:</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/a16z/the-two-big-problems-with-thomas-pikettys-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century">The a16z Podcast: The Two Big Problems With Thomas Piketty&#8217;s &#8220;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&#8221;</a>. Very interesting discussion on wealth inequality through the lens of Thomas Piketty&#8217;s hit new book. I ended up listening to this twice, but by the end, when I could finally follow Larry Summers and Balaji Srinivasan, I was very glad that I did.</p>

<p><a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/fear-of-the-blank-page/">The Weekly Briefly: Fear of the Blank Page</a>. In this week&#8217;s Friday episode of Shawn Blanc&#8217;s daily members-only podcast Shawn Today, released publicly as part of The Weekly Briefly, he talked about the ever-present fear of failure particularly amongst creative individuals and offered some suggestions for overcoming it. I tend to shy away from this type of touchy-feely self-help, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as usual&#160;&#8212;&#160;Shawn had don&#8217;t great insights and equally helpful advice. Yet another great example illustrating why everyone ought to support Shawn in subscribing to this show.</p>

<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/65">ATP Episode 65 The Year of Casey</a>: I turned this this episode on as I left my girlfriend&#8217;s dance recital last weekend, only to find myself laughing aloud as walked through the parking lot at one of the show&#8217;s best openings in a while. After that, Marco, John, and Casey talked about the Overcast beta finally shipping, Casey&#8217;s huge news, the perpetually confirmed-unconfirmed rumor of Apple&#8217;s Beats acquisition, and the perils of JavaScript and relying on third-party code. Come for the opening, but stay for the main topic: as someone who, like Marco, prefers to write everything myself, this was a good look at both the upsides and the downsides to this approach.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/034-developing-workflow-software-with-greg-pierce">Technical Difficulties Episode 34: Developing Workflow Software with Greg Pierce</a>. Gabe Weatherhead and Erik Hess recorded a nice interview with the creator of my favorite note-taking app, Drafts, and go-to iOS dictionary, Terminology, where they talked about Greg Pierce&#8217;s career as an Apple developer and the life thus far of the apps that have, along with his significant work to further the x-callback-url scheme, made him famous. And if you want even more of Greg, <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/81">Brett Terpstra had him on Systematic</a> earlier this year as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/035-information-capture-and-recall-with-bradley-chambers">Technical Difficulties Episode 35: Information Capture and Recall with Bradley Chambers</a>. I used to use Evernote daily, but gradually lost interest as I moved towards plain text and Markdown. After this episode with Bradley Chambers though, I&#8217;m going to put a concerted effort into giving it another try.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/036-advocating-for-science-and-exploration-with-emily-lakdawalla">Technical Difficulties Episode 36: Advocating for Science and Exploration with Emily Lakdawalla</a>. Interesting discussion on space exploration and its importance not only to children, but the United States as well; however, this topic belied some fascinating thoughts on the current state of education in this country, for which I believe this episode ought to be lauded for even more so than the former.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/crush/1">Crush on Radio: The Wrens are the Ultimate Bar Joke</a>. Terrific episode with Merlin Mann and Richard Anderson not necessarily because I have any interest in or appreciation of The Wrens, but rather because this episode was so well done: not only did it feature a great guest and a superb host, but also impressive production values across the board from audio quality to integrating music clips. Anyone looking to record a multi-media podcast ought to start here to first see it done extremely well.</p>

<p>Until next week, friends. I wish you, and especially any of you who served in the military, a very happy Memorial Day.</p>

<p>Like Josh, I prefer to navigate with swipes rather than taps. However, unlike him, I prefer tidy swiping&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, I prefer my apps not to register my gestures unless I begin them in certain areas, such as the extreme left side of the screen: whenever I want to go back in an app&#8217;s visual hierarchy, for example, I put my finger up against my case&#8217;s left bumper and swipe across; it would be confusing and annoying if I made an accidental rightward swipe and unintentionally moved back a screen. I do recognize the value of sloppy swiping, though; the key, then, is to strike a balance between the two. Even if that balance is struck though, there&#8217;s a discoverability problem with gestures that you just don&#8217;t have with buttons: you can see a button, while gestures are invisible.</p>

<p>More than two years ago, a company called Nosh got quite a bit of attention for their inventive approach to the generally unremarkable 404 error page: rather than the usual, bland description or even a poor attempt at humor, the folks over at Nosh made a video, and a fantastic one at that. I won&#8217;t spoil it for you here, but I will say this: this video stands the test of time in a way that few other things from even two years ago do; it&#8217;s just as cool now as it was then.</p>

<p>For better or worse&#160;&#8212;&#160;better in my opinion, but clearly worse if you looked at my bank statement&#160;&#8212;&#160;money has always been nothing more than the means to an end for me, and not a goal in and of itself. I want to have a good job where I can work hard and receive appropriate compensation after a job well done, but outside of a safety net should said job fall through, a costly, once in a lifetime opportunity arise, or an unexpected bill arrive in the mail, I have no interest in padding my checking and savings accounts. I never want to be the one that tells my girlfriend we can&#8217;t have a nice dinner and go to a movie because it&#8217;s too expensive, especially when I have a $50 bill in my pocket. I will admit that this is by no means a great approach to managing my finances, and in the long run very likely an unsustainable one, but I will regret missing that nice evening much more than I will ever regret spending a portion of that $50; I want to spend my evenings holding my girlfriend&#8217;s hand, not a wrinkled bill.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-19 16:54:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/19 16:54:49 EST</time>
<p>Over the past week especially, there has been a fair bit of discussion devoted to podcasting&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Blogger moment&#8221;. In particular, John Gruber and Mike Monteiro discussed this on <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/80/">the latest episode of The Talk Show</a>, and Myke Hurley and Casey Liss spent some time talking about it on <a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/96">CMD+SPACE 96: Not Many Original Thoughts, with Casey Liss</a> as well. In a nutshell, the idea is that just as Blogger brought blogging to the masses in the early 2000s and consequently caused the medium to explode in popularity, so too will podcasting have a similar moment whereby it breaks through the nerd barrier and goes mainstream. Interestingly, many at the forefront of the podcast medium believe that time to be now. For what reasons they believe this, however, I cannot say.</p>

<p>Podcasts are growing, of that I would have to be insane to argue against; the writing is on the wall, as the saying goes, by which I mean that it is patently obvious and nearly everywhere: you can&#8217;t swing a pair of headphones around these days without hitting someone who runs their own network. The podcast space is not, however, growing exceptionally fast, but rather at an appropriate pace for a fledgling industry gaining in popularity at a respectable pace. Moreover, it is also not making significant advancements towards going mainstream: outside of healthy but nevertheless unremarkable growth, the medium has remained very true to its roots in not changing drastically since it debuted as a format geared specifically towards a certain niche rather than created with mass market appeal in mind. Unfortunately then, despite all the grandiose pictures many like to paint of this medium taking the world by storm, this is the reality we live in, partly because there is no catalyst spurring explosive growth and widespread awareness&#160;&#8212;&#160;we do not yet have the Blogger of podcasts, the thing that will make podcasting accessible to everyone on all fronts, both in regards to consumption and creation.</p>

<p>There are certainly some very interesting things going on in this space right now, such as Fiat Lux&#8217;s <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/constellation.html">Constellation</a>, for example, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as much as it pains me to say this, as a huge fan of this space&#160;&#8212;&#160;we are not quite to our Blogger moment just yet. We have everything necessary for that revolution&#160;&#8212;&#160;podcasts have high production values and focus on an incredibly diverse range of topics&#160;&#8212;&#160;but these are not yet sufficient.</p>

<p>Relative to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-5514.html">last week&#8217;s</a>, and compared to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-42814.html">the week prior&#8217;s</a>, another relatively short list this time around, unfortunately. But, as I have said before, volume and quality are rarely linked: I will never pad these out with shows of dubious value just to reach an arbitrary length. This is a curated list of the best podcasts I discovered within the last week, and so it will forever remain.</p>

<p>The only thing better than waking up to a new episode of Roderick on the Line is realizing that I somehow erroneously marked last week&#8217;s episode as read, and so I now have two to listen to; such was the case this week, and boy did it make for a great Tuesday afternoon:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-109-supervan.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 109: #SuperVan</a>. Different nonsensical approaches to education, and how you don&#8217;t actually have to be good at school to take the tough classes: just strike a deal with your teachers until you get to Junior High, then recite the Declaration of Independence. Also, many of the aspects of democracy that make it so great also make it very, very hard.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-110-the-dignity-police.html">Roderick on the Line Episode 110: The Dignity Police</a>. John deals with big infrastructure, and decides to become the Secretary of Transportation. It&#8217;s shows like this one that makes me wish I knew more about The Beatles, music in general, and my parents&#8217; generation.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-002-the-missing-episode/">Exponent Episode 02: The Missing Episode</a>. The lost second episode of Exponent, recorded right after the first and before the show even had a website. Like its predecessor, this is yet another remarkable show: this time Ben Thompson and James Allworth talk about the culture of Silicon Valley, the type of person it attracts, and the genre of problems this atmosphere encourages those within this hotbed to solve. Unsurprisingly, truly fantastic and incredibly insightful&#160;&#8212;&#160;a must.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/96">Systematic Episode 96: Economic Audiophilia with Matthew Ward</a>. Brett Terpstra has Mathew Ward on to talk about an alternative approach to audiophilia, and then programming languages in academia. Personally though, I found the former portion much more intriguing: I strive to have the best I can in every area, and in the real of audio equipment that pursuit becomes very pricey very fast; that doesn&#8217;t always have to be the case, though, thankfully, as Mathew explains here.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/032-blogging-platforms-with-bob-vanderclay">Technical Difficulties Episode 32: Blogging Platforms with Bob VanderClay</a>. Gabe and Eric have an interesting conversation with Bob Vanderclay on the various sites, services, and methods you can use to build and deploy a website these days. A must if you plan on starting your own site anytime soon, and doubly so if you&#160;&#8212;&#160;like me&#160;&#8212;&#160;have any desire to build your own platform: taking the greatest aspects from the best blogging solutions and then rolling them together into your own, personalized approach is by far and away the best way to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/033-what-happened-when-gabe-set-himself-on-fire">Technical Difficulties Episode 33: What Happened when Gabe Set Himself on Fire</a>. This time around, Eric interviewed Gabe in an interesting talk about Gabe&#8217;s journey from a childhood making things explode to becoming a professional chemist to working in technology. Then, in the last half hour, Gabe regained control over the reigns and the two spent some time talking about Eric&#8217;s career as a pilot. I love these more personal shows.</p>

<p><a href="http://podbay.fm/show/536258179/e/1400126400">Welcome to Nightvale Episode 47: Company Picnic</a>. I apologize for not linking to an official site for this episode, but it seems Commonplace Books does not host their episodes of Nightvale online anywhere except in iTunes. Nevertheless, I had to post a link here: although as a first time listener the significance of this episode will likely be lost on you, as someone who has listened from the beginning I found this one haunting. The writers over at Commonplace Books do a really fantastic job with this show.</p>

<p>For the podcast super fans out there and anyone else who wants to read some more about this medium, look for my upcoming article on podcasting&#8217;s so-called &#8220;blogger moment&#8221;, due tomorrow afternoon. Until then, though, you have your work cut out for you.</p>

<p>As a Feed Wrangler subscriber myself, I&#8217;m glad to hear that this has not only become a profitable and sustainable business for David Smith, but an intellectually fulfilling one as well full of many more potential avenues of exploration. Feed Wrangler is right now at the cusp of its Instapaper 4 moment, right after Marco Arment sold the service to Betaworks: very much in need of improvements that it will undoubtedly receive in short order and to fantastic results. Buckle up, folks: this is going to be one great year for everything RSS.  and to fantastic results. Buckle up, folks: this is going to be one great year for everything RSS.</p>

<p>Yes&#160;&#8212;&#160;I agree with everything in this article from Sid O&#8217;Neill, from the lessons that ought to be applied generously when driving during the winter to the appropriate etiquette on the internet. We could all benefit from slowing down a little and realizing that everyone else has as many problems as we do, and that completely disregarding the validity of another&#8217;s existence, much less the validity of the challenges they face every single day, is no way to live at all.</p>

<p>There must be something in the water&#160;&#8212;&#160;over the last few months, a surprising number of writers have gone independent, each with varying degrees of success: first <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/">Brett Terpstra</a>, then <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/">Matt Gemmell</a>, followed by <a href="http://www.patreon.com/crateofpenguins">Sid O&#8217;Neill</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/membership/">Ben Thompson</a> soon after. Personally, I think this is wonderful: these great writers have left their distracting nine-to-five jobs to focus on the thing they love and that I love to read; fantastic. However, two of them in particular had a very strange approach to going independent, and one that I feel merits some exploration. Specifically, both Sid O&#8217;Neill and Ben Thompson allow complete strangers to purchase a guarantee of their time and attention.</p>

<p>Sid O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s Patreon campaign lists three cumulative membership tiers for those wishing to back him and his writing: for $1 a month, your name will appear on his &#8220;Support&#8221; page; $5 a month nets you the previous perk as well as a promise from Sid that he will follow you on twitter, &#8220;...so we can trade meta-commentary away from the public gaze.&#8221;; and the $10 per month tier includes the previous two incentives as well as the opportunity for Sid to work &#8220;you or your delegate into [his] new creative project&#8221;. Similarly with regards to Ben Thompson&#8217;s membership initiative, the &#8220;Daily Update&#8221; tier comes in at $10 every month and, in exchange, his readers receive a short periodical containing Ben&#8217;s thoughts on the latest tech news. For $30 each month, however, his subscribers receive that publication as well as access to a private Glassboard of which he is a part, virtual and in-person meetups around the world, and Ben&#8217;s personal email address with the guarantee of timely and reasoned responses.</p>

<p>To make myself quite clear, I do not think these trades are at all unfair: for a near-inconsequential sum every month, these writers have promised not only to continue creating the content their readers so enjoy, but to do so with an explicit focus on interacting with their readers as well. And that&#8217;s great, but the way Sid and Ben achieve this noble goal is also a little strange to me: in an age where attention means everything, willfully selling yours to a potentially large number of people for such a small sum seems crazy and, quite frankly, backwards: these individuals no longer have to create cool things and form interesting and worthwhile commentary in order to attract the attention of the writers they respect; as of today, $35 monthly could grant me permission to pollute Sid O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s twitter stream with godawful cat pictures and Ben Thompson&#8217;s inbox with malformed pseudo-analysis. The pursuit of independence has reduced a former meritocracy to a nepotistic system in which those with a little extra cash can take the express lane to a position everyone else, up until now, has spent great amounts of time and effort climbing to step by step. And, I feel, that is truly unfortunate.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/looking-to-ios-8.html">Looking to iOS 8</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-14 19:14:21-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/14 19:14:21 EST</time>
<p>Late last month, Federico Viticci wrote a great article about his iOS 8 wishes. I agreed with some of his suggestions, disagreed with the necessity a few, and consider still others a bit too niche for Apple to have focused much time and energy, if any, on over the last twelve months. By the end of his piece, I had decided to write out my own list in preparation for WWDC, as we all begin to turn our attention towards the impending unveiling of iOS 8 alongside the possibility of wearable devices and <a href="https://twitter.com/apollozac/status/453320478804152320">CarPlay demos in a Ferrari</a>. Unlike Federico, I have no spectacular introduction to kick us off; in lieu of that, then, I suppose we ought to just get straight to the point.</p>

<p>Many of the entries in Federico&#8217;s lengthy list are very exacting, focused on one specific aspect of an app or service that Apple could improve. The way I see it, though, is that most of these are the things bloggers will write about afterwards: someone will talk about the updated music app, The Wall Street Journal will explain&#160;&#8212;&#160;in single-sentence paragraphs&#160;&#8212;&#160;how the new Photos app spells the end of Apple, and someone will invariably have a problem with Apple&#8217;s handling of in-line message replies in Notification Center. These are not, however, the things that Apple will spend any significant amount of time on in their keynote presentation. As such, I find the majority of these second-tier updates uninteresting and unworthy of speculation: the music app will change, although I doubt we will see Beats Music have much of an influence on it until iOS 9 at least; Photos will as well, once again in a novel and interesting way likely having something to do with better photo management; and an improved system for notification management seems like a no-brainer: remember how iOS 6 provided for the creation of tweets and Facebook status updates in the Notification Center? It would come as a great surprise to me if iOS 8 did not debut with a similar system, except for all text-based messages. No, to me, these are not the interesting avenues to explore leading up to WWDC next month, but rather the headlining features that will steal the show and spark controversy and discussion until WWDC 2015; it is to those that I wish to turn my focus today.</p>

<p>In no particular order, I see two areas in which Apple has an opportunity for massive, groundbreaking improvement; one aspect in need of some subtle but, importantly, not drastic changes; and one feature that, while asked for by many, ought not come to the platform in any more of a meaningful way than it already exists there. Were I a (read this in Marco&#8217;s <em>brand</em> voice) <em>problogger</em> obsessed with page views, I would dub this &#8220;Apple&#8217;s Four-Pronged Success Strategy&#8221; or, more likely, &#8220;Four Weird Ways Apple Will Win&#8221;; I would also name the final, as of yet unknown feature or service to come out with iOS 8 something sensational like &#8220;The X Factor&#8221;. But I am not, and so my dry, less flashy approach will have to suffice.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, I consider Siri and Touch ID Apple&#8217;s two greatest advantages inherent to iOS; nevertheless, despite their remarkable latent ability, these two have yet to reach their full potential&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even come close, in my opinion; I would love to see Apple expand the functionality of both in iOS 8. For starters, Apple could imbue in Siri better faculties for identifying and interpreting context: when I make a reminder, let me say &#8220;Send that to my girlfriend as well&#8221; and have Siri understand the intent of my command rather than take it literally, only to then ask what I want to send her. And speaking of reliability, some improvement in that area would not hurt. I need a competent assistant, not a scatterbrained one.</p>

<p>Apple could also bring some welcome changes to Siri by making it a native service, and then allowing app developers to interact directly with it. Unfortunately though, these capability are incredibly difficult to build well. Take offline dictation, for example: when Mavericks brought this feature to the Mac last year, enabling it required a download of more than three-quarters of a gigabyte&#160;&#8212;&#160;785 megabytes, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2066026/mavericks-dictation-vs-dragon-dictate-how-good-is-os-xs-built-in-tool-.html">actually</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;and it&#8217;s not even very good at interpreting speech, much less controlling my computer; Siri, which does a much better job of parsing and transcribing natural language, would likely necessitate even more space as a local service. As much as I would love to see a native implementation of Siri, I just don&#8217;t see Apple potentially doubling the size of their mobile operating system for this one feature.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a public Siri API faces similarly difficult challenges: while it sounds like a fantastic idea, Siri&#8217;s ability to discern the one correct word out of a near-infinite number of possible matches using inferred context similar to that of auto-correct becomes much less applicable when attempting to interpret complex commands like &#8220;Open Drafts and use the &#8216;Send to Dropbox&#8217; command, then delete the note.&#8221;. Understanding these chained events will prove difficult, to say the least. That said though, there is hope for these developments: Google already does offline speech recognition, and many consider Google&#8217;s more capable implementation much better than Apple&#8217;s despite Siri&#8217;s inability to do much more than schedule reminders and check the weather. So despite my misgivings, I expect Tim Cook will surprise me with some very impressive refinements to one of Apple&#8217;s two greatest points of differentiation next month at WWDC.</p>

<p>On the Touch ID side of things, Apple has another opportunity for great improvement, this time in the area of authentication. Last year, Apple dipped its toe in this space with the creation of Touch ID and iCloud Keychain; however, it went no further than that: thus far, these two features have remained wholly separate and unconnected, and thus of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/rethinking-passwords.html">little practical use</a>. In iOS 8, I would love to see this change: if Apple could make iCloud Keychain more reliable, less of a black box whereby I have no control over what goes on in it after adding new login credentials, and bring it to iOS in a meaningful way, I would have no problem moving to it from 1Password if doing so meant I no longer had to ever enter a password again, but instead could use my fingerprint to unlock the pertinent credentials regardless of whether I had an app or website open.</p>

<p>Some would undoubtedly characterize such a move as a betrayal of their trust: Apple promised not even the operating system could access a fingerprint scan when it unveiled Touch ID last year, and when taken at face value this stellar combination with iCloud Keychain seems like a violation of that promise. However, I have no doubt Apple could build out a system whereby iCloud Keychain determined the appropriate credentials for a site or service, and then Touch ID provided a simple pass/fail boolean when asked whether the user in possession of the device had the necessary clearance to access the area in question. This feature pairing would bring with it a whole host of benefits, such as increased password security as iCloud Keychain no longer only suggested secure passwords for websites, but apps as well, along with the obvious benefit of taking password entry completely out of the equation. Greater system-wide Touch ID integration would also open up the possibility for many other interesting features involving fast and simple authentication in the future, such as&#160;&#8212;&#160;potentially&#160;&#8212;&#160;fast user switching, a feature that many have called for in iOS for quite some time now. It all starts with opening Touch ID to the operating system, though; in order for any of these great abilities to come to iOS, we must start there. Touch ID could very well steal the show at WWDC.</p>

<p>Moving on from these two feature sets in which I hope to see Apple make some incredible progress, I believe the company would be remiss to neglect the iOS 7 aesthetic. Unlike a surprisingly large number of people, I do not consider iOS 7 a failure; however, I do believe it needs some minor refinements in a number of areas ultimately in service of making the entire user experience feel more polished. It is important that these changes remain minor refinements, though: Apple has a tendency to swing for the fences, and thus we found ourselves with iOS 7 last June. Now, as they hopefully dial back some of the more extreme changes and approach the sweet spot of design done well, I hope they will iterate with that tendency in mind. I have every confidence Apple will do just that, but it remains a wish of mine for iOS 8 all the same.</p>

<p>Finally&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this will likely be the most controversial part of this article&#160;&#8212;&#160;I do not think Apple should make any significant moves towards greater inter-app communication than it already facilitates through such means as the x-callback-url protocol; I may even go so far as to say that I hope they will not. This is an undoubtedly unpopular opinion though, especially amongst nerds, so let me explain myself: as the saying goes, constraints breed creativity. As a result of iOS&#8217;s numerous restrictions, developers have created some truly fantastic workarounds built over the years that have given rise to, most recently, the amazing <a href="http://omz-forums.appspot.com/editorial/post/5900430768865280">ui module in Editorial</a>, to name just one outstanding example of innovation born of a need unfulfilled by Apple. Whatever Apple might build in iOS 8 to finally fill this void, there is a very good chance that it will fall short of the standards and conventions we have managed to piece together until now. Moreover, the need for greater inter-app communication is a very niche one: even I as a relatively demanding user have no need for this beyond the capabilities x-callback-urls provide, and I can speak from firsthand experience in saying that the need is nonexistent among the mass market. I realize the flaw in this argument even as I say it, but iOS has done just fine until now without developers having the ability to share data between apps; why fix a problem that does not exist?</p>

<p>First outlined the key areas I hope Apple will have focused its efforts; namely, Siri, Touch ID, and minor interface refinements. I also explained the reasons I hope Apple does little to further inter-app communication: whatever feature set would seek to fulfill this perceived need, it would almost undoubtedly fall short of the impressive solutions developers have already created and thus turn into more of a hindrance than a help. Even these refinements and omissions, however, would likely appear only in brief demos following the main, show-stopping revelation. But as to the specifics of that unknown feature, I have little idea outside of a certainty that it will exist: iOS 7 had a major design overhaul, iOS 6 provided the back-end capabilities for developers to utilize the larger iPhone 5&#8217;s screen size, and broke Google&#8217;s hold on the ecosystem; but what will iOS 8 have? Something involving music, as the recent rumor of a Beats acquisition might indicate? Perhaps, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I said&#160;&#8212;&#160;I suspect, should the deal actually take place, that we will not see any direct influence until iOS 9 at the earliest. What, then? At the end of the day, this is the question I find most attractive to answer, perhaps in no small part because I have no idea. But that&#8217;s what makes writing about Apple so interesting: in the end, we&#8217;re all just guessing.</p>

<p>Incredible words from Rohan Anderson on living a meaningful life. In particular, those of his fifth paragraph struck me especially hard. I was sorely tempted to extract the relevant paragraph and paste it below, but I will not deprive him of the credit he so deserves for writing this piece. I sincerely hope you will go check it out.</p>

<p>I made it to Thursday afternoon with only three episodes here, as woefully underpopulated as last week&#8217;s issue had been. But then, as they say, a miracle happened: all of a sudden every show I turned on wowed me, and before I knew it, I had the sprawling list you see stretched out before you. A sprawling list of, as usual, the best podcasts curated from those I listened to over this last week; it doesn&#8217;t get much better than this. Unfortunately though, I forgot to post it on Sunday: Mothers&#8217; Day got the best of me, I suppose. Sorry&#160;&#8212;&#160;but let me assure you, this will be worth your wait.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/024-text-editors-and-plain-text">Technical Difficulties Episode 24: Text Editors and Plain Text</a>. Although slightly outdated given the rapidly-changing nature of text editors and the platforms on which they run, I found this a very interesting discussion on the state of plain text and the future of Markdown both. Although I&#8217;m not sure a bundled format is the solution to the problem of limited features facilitated by simple plain text files, it is nevertheless an interesting thought exercise to consider the ways in which this format could be improved.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/025-design-and-fighter-jets">Technical Difficulties Episode 25: Design and Fighter Jets</a>. Gabe Weatherhead had Nate Hess on to talk about design and how its principles apply to everything from simple colors and typography to infinitely complex airplanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/029-myke-hurley-and-building-a-new-career">Technical Difficulties Episode 29: Myke Hurley and Building a New Career</a>. Back when Myke Hurley used to be British, he sat down with Gabe and Eric Hess to talk about his journey into podcasts and the future of this beloved medium. I have heard this story a hundred times before, and I could listen to it a hundred times more.</p>

<p><a href="http://techpinions.com/the-tech-pinions-podcast-amazon-smartphones/30145">The Tech.pinions Podcast Episode 03: Amazon Smartphones</a>. In the second episode of Tech.pinion&#8217;s recently-revived podcast, Ben Bajarin, Bob O&#8217;Donnell, and Jan Dawson talk about the seemingly inevitable Amazon smartphone, the future of this space in light of Amazon&#8217;s impending entrance, and how that company could choose to differentiate its offering in a space crowded by entrenched players. I will not spoil their conclusion, but I will say this: everyone looking to Amazon to make a phone with a better camera than everyone else completely misses the point.</p>

<p><a href="http://thevoicemail.wordpress.com/2014/05/08/episode-097/">The Voicemail Episode 97</a>. In the latter section of this week&#8217;s The Voicemail, Stefan Constantinescu and James Whatley devoted a fair amount of time to giving one of their listeners some helpful suggestions as to what makes for a great podcast. Namely, good audio gear and high production values, with optional tertiary aspects such as time limits contingent on personal preference and editing that, once again, ought to be applied&#160;&#8212;&#160;or not&#160;&#8212;&#160;according to the convictions of the producer. Not to dredge up <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html">an old argument</a>, but that&#8217;s how Harry Marks should have put forth his thoughts on what makes a podcast good: as <em>suggestions</em> rather than hard and fast rules. James and Stephan did this very well.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/94">Systematic Episode 94: Work Overload With David Chartier</a>. From last week that I somehow forgot to mention earlier, Brett Terpstra had David Chartier on to talk about Agile Bits, 1Password, and finding a work/life balance when you have many interests and trouble denying any one of them. I will come out and admit it&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;m terrible at this: I leave my house just after six every morning, work all day, get home between three and four o&#8217;clock, hit the gym for an hour, and then spend whatever time I have left in the day at my computer reading and writing. But this, right now, is where my <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/fear-and-passion.html">passion</a> lies, and so&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least for now&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have no desire to deny it.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/95">Systematic Episode 95: Robert McGinley Myers&#160;&#8212;&#160;Tech Anxiety</a>. Brett had a great talk with Robert Myers this week on, among other things, creativity. In particular, I found Robert&#8217;s blogging saga especially impactful given that I just went through <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/fear-and-passion.html">the same thing</a>: just as he plodded along with mediocre results until, one day, his site exploded in popularity after a popular blogger turned his fire hose of a readership towards Robert&#8217;s site, so, too, did my blog climb to minor renown after Jim Dalrymple linked to it; and just as Robert used the ensuing enthusiasm to create like he never had before, as I chose to as well, only to then burn himself out shortly after, I met with the same fate earlier this week. It&#8217;s nice to know that I am not alone in this.</p>

<p><a href="http://stratechery.fm/episode-003-twitter-secret-and-yik-yak/">Stratechery.fm Episode 04: Twitter, Secret, and Yik Yak</a>. Fantastic episode on Twitter, social networks, and anonymity vis a vis Secret and Yik Yak. As I have said in the past, to further explain this episode would be to do it a great disservice, so I will simply leave you with this: unsurprisingly, the latest episode of Ben Thompson and Jon Nathanson&#8217;s podcast is a <em>must</em> if you have any interest in this space. Fascinating.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/95">CMD+SPACE 95: Playing It Cool, with Dan Moren</a>. Just an all-around great interview between podcasting kingpin Myke Hurley and Dan Moren.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-35-scotty-nsconference-and-remobjects">Debug Episode 35: Scotty on NSConference and RemObjects</a>. Speaking of great interviews, Guy English and Rene Ritchie had Steve Scott on to talk about handling nuclear waste and automating prisons, as well as NSConference and his other ventures. Scott has had one interesting career, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/47">The Prompt Episode 47: What&#8217;s a Cupcake?</a>. With Myke back, he, Federico, and Stephen talk iOS 8 wishes, give a preview of some realistic WWDC predictions, and discuss the reasons App.net failed&#160;&#8212;&#160;because that is <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/social-success.html">exactly what happened, make no mistake</a>. After the aforementioned episode of Stratechery.fm, this is a great complement focusing on the other side of the social coin.</p>

<p>Until next week, friends.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-10 09:37:56-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/10 09:37:56 EST</time>
<p>On <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/63">last week&#8217;s episode of the Accidental Tech Podcast</a>, John Siracusa spent a great deal of time explaining his disappointment in Apple for sticking to its long-held policy whereby it takes a 30% cut of all digital transactions, regardless of volume. He theorized that Apple&#8217;s strict adherence to this rule had led Amazon to remove comiXology&#8217;s ability to sell comics within the app, thus leading to a detrimental user experience for this segment of Apple users who now had to use a clunky web-based workaround. Then, in <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/64">this week&#8217;s</a> follow-up segment, John revisited this subject in response to a number of listener comments questioning how his suggester solution&#160;&#8212;&#160;a discounted cut for high-volume retailers driving huge traffic through Apple&#8217;s platform, such as Amazon would with in-app purchases of comics and books, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;did not clash with his stated support of net neutrality. Rather than weigh in with my feedback in an email though, I would rather it appear in a public forum if for no other reason than so that, if I am completely off-base, someone can tell me so; because as I listened to John justify his position in response to his listeners&#8217; opinions, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel he completely missed the point.</p>

<p>The entire argument in favor of net neutrality is predicated on the belief that at some point in the future, an entrant will emerge with a better business model, a superior product, or revolutionary and disruptive approach to an entrenched player&#8217;s space&#160;&#8212;&#160;or some combination of all three&#160;&#8212;&#160;but will nevertheless fail because while the incumbent can afford to shell out vast sums of money to ensure speedy delivery of high-quality content to its users, this upstart cannot. For example, in such a world where net neutrality does not exist, a company could come out with a service superior to that of Netflix&#8217;s in every way&#160;&#8212;&#160;cheaper monthly fees, a larger catalog, and higher-quality media&#160;&#8212;&#160;but because Netflix can afford to have its videos delivered at twice the speed our hypothetical upstart can, Netflix will inevitably win out. Unfortunately, although the necessity of net neutrality in this hypothetical future scenario is clear, it remains just that: both a hypothetical <em>and</em> a future scenario, meanwhile the promise of faster Netflix viewing is both a very real and immediately-realized offering. Needless to say, this can make explaining the value of this concept extremely difficult.</p>

<p>I did not choose net neutrality for the main topic today, though, but rather John&#8217;s suggestion that Apple could&#160;&#8212;&#160;and should&#160;&#8212;&#160;either lower or remove its imposed 30% cut on all digital transactions in order to make its digital retail business more attractive to resellers and, thus, provide a better experience to its users. I don&#8217;t mean to single out John, for others have made similar suggestions as of late, especially with WWDC fast approaching and thus the potential for huge changes such as this as well, but his response to this valid question came off as a dismissal more than a considered reply made in recognition of the validity of the other side&#8217;s opinion. And after that, what choice did I have but to put my own thoughts on this matter to words? Let me answer that for you&#160;&#8212;&#160;none.</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario in which two companies, Company A and Company B, sell the same goods. Company B, however, has operated for a number of years already and amassed a great deal of money and power in its chosen space, whereas Company A is naught but an upstart. Both looking to expand their presence in an emerging market, each approach the same retailer who informs them that they will both have to turn over 50% of the selling price in order to stock their widgets on it shelves. Company A takes the retailer off to the side and explains that it learned from Company B&#8217;s early mistakes and built a better product, so although it will only move a small number of units at first, it will undoubtedly become a huge business in the future. Until then, though, it really, <em>really</em> needs to not lose 50<code> of its widgets&#8217; value just to bring them to market. The retailer, however, sticks to its guns: no volume, no discount. Company B, however, has no problem decreasing its margins by 50</code> in exchange for reaching this new market, and so it strikes a deal with the retailer; Company A, reluctantly, does as well, counting on its superior product to differentiate itself from the lower-quality version its competitor sells.</p>

<p>Company A&#8217;s detractors spoke very critically of this move, questioning why it did not just go with another venue&#160;&#8212;&#160;this retailer was, after all, but a small player in the grand scheme of things, with only a small percentage of the market under its control. However, even the loudest of voices failed to realize that within this target market segment of high-value consumers, this retailer <em>is</em> the <em>only</em> game in town; it would not be wholly inappropriate to say it had a monopoly on this user base, because it did. To liken it to a real-world example, as clich&#233;d and worthy of mockery as this phrase has become, Apple does indeed have a monopoly on iOS users.</p>

<p>At this point, our hypothetical yet all too likely scenario can go one of four ways&#160;&#8212;&#160;think of this as one of those &#8220;choose your own ending&#8221; stories: in the first scenario, unable to subsist on such meager revenue, Company A eventually folds, leaving the monolithic Company B the only game in town. Alternately, no one looks closely enough or cares enough to distinguish between the two companies&#8217; widgets, and ultimately chooses Company B&#8217;s because they recognize the brand; Company A, once again, fails. In the third scenario, some non-insignificant portion of the market realizes the value of Company A&#8217;s product over that of Company B&#8217;s, but the latter undercuts the former into nonexistence, using its vast resources and sway to back up this unsustainable strategy. Finally, in our fourth and final scenario, everyone loves Company A&#8217;s product more&#160;&#8212;&#160;they realize its superiority to that of Company B&#8217;s, and they begin buying it only to have Company B offer the retailer an extra 20% cut, because they can afford it, to make its inferior product appear more often and in a more complimentary light than everyone else&#8217;s. As for the end result, I&#8217;m sure you can guess.</p>

<p>In the end, then, no matter what happens, Company A&#160;&#8212;&#160;the proverbial &#8220;little guy&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;loses even though it has the better widget and beats Company B in every aspect save price. Most importantly though, the consumer loses as well. The companies involved, retailer making all the rules, widget in question, price, profit margin, percent cut, and the size of the target market matter not, for the end result remains the same across the board whenever a prohibitively difficult to obtain advantage is made available to one player involved, but remains out of reach of the others: the entrant, unable to ante up with the appropriate buy in, inevitably fails, leaving Company B, Netflix, or whichever imposing corporation applies to the story at hand, the unchallenged winner. I fail to see how this is any different than net neutrality, I fail to see how either is better than the other, and I fail to see how both are not equally terrible. But please&#160;&#8212;&#160;enlighten me: the way things are going now, I would love to have someone prove me wrong.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-09 17:43:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/09 17:43:49 EST</time>
<p>When Apple released iOS 7.1 to the public in early March, many heralded it as the version of iOS 7 that should have shipped last September in 2013; iOS 7.1 is what iOS 7 should have been. Faced with severe time constraints, however, the popular narrative paints a picture of Apple having no choice but to release what many would come to call a half-baked product or slip on their intended release date. Unsurprisingly, the desire to stick with the latter made the former a necessity, and thus we found ourselves with the oft-criticized iOS 7.</p>

<p>Prior to Betaworks released Instapaper 5, I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/instapaper-5.html">a lengthy article</a> detailing my hopes for the popular read later service&#8217;s next major version. Then, when Betaworks finally launched the new and improved Instapaper in conjunction with iOS 7&#8217;s release, I once again put pen to paper, except this time <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/betaworks-releases-instapaper-5.html">to express my disappointment</a>: the app read as little more than a superficial redesign, and the website counterpart would have looked and worked better in the state Marco had left it, in my opinion. Just as iOS 7 appeared to have suffered greatly at the hands of a time constraint, so, too, did Instapaper 5 apparently suffer for lack of time spent in development as Betaworks readied it for the fast-approaching iOS 7 debut. But just as iOS 7.1 redeemed the operating system and fixed many of its preceding version&#8217;s shortcomings, Instapaper 5.2, <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/85125160146">released yesterday afternoon</a>, did as well.</p>

<p>Sporting completely new interfaces in both the web and iPhone app, with a minor update for the iPad counterpart, Instapaper looks truly fantastic. More importantly though, it works <em>great</em> everywhere: on top of the addition of Highlights, a greatly sought-after feature that eluded both Marco Arment and, after its sale, Betaworks as well for quite some time, a number of other nice usability and interface tweaks, as well as the addition of &#8220;Storm&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;a new theme between Sepia and Dark&#160;&#8212;&#160;, make Instapaper a great pleasure to use once again on mobile. And as if these changes were not enough though, a similarly drastic UI overhaul on the web side of things has taken Instapaper from an embarrassment to the epitome of design done well both in terms of beautiful aesthetics and remarkable usability. In tandem with the continued improvement of its parsing engine, Betaworks has finally snapped the last thorns pushing me to try Pocket and consider moving to Pinboard, and once again bound me&#160;&#8212;&#160;deservedly, and to my great delight&#160;&#8212;&#160;to their platform with these fantastic updates.</p>

<p>Instapaper 5.2 is what Instapaper 5 should have been, and it&#8217;s really, really awesome.</p>

<p>Great to see Soylent popping back up in the news again, this time courtesy of <a href="http://nextdraft.com/archives/n20140505/will-it-blend/">Dave Pell&#8217;s The Next Draft</a> and The New Yorker&#8217;s Lizzie Widdicombe. In the past, I have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/soylent.html">written</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-few-more-thoughts-on-soylent.html">about</a> and linked to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/two-months-of-soylent.html">articles</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/soylent-on-the-verge.html">discussing</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-i-survived-a-week-without-food.html">this</a> a number of times, but never took my enthusiasm for Rob Rhinehart&#8217;s creation any further.

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-08 18:27:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/08 18:27:51 EST</time>
<p>I have a tendency to write long, rambling, retrospective introductions filled with background information of dubious value that I, for some reason, nevertheless deign to include as a prelude to beginning my actual article. This time, however, I want to get straight to the point.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few tweets and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-414.html">two</a> queued <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-42814.html">articles</a>, I have remained virtually silent for nearly a week. In stark contrast to my usual habit of making at least one post per day, with some nonzero number of original articles every week, this is remarkably strange for me. But last week I had final exams, this week I started my full-time summer job once again, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;to put it quite simply&#160;&#8212;&#160;I no longer prioritize writing in my life. <em>Gasp</em>.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the kicker: it&#8217;s been <em>nice</em>.</p>

<p>Ever since I started this site close to two years ago, I have pushed and struggled and fought every single day so that I could, and would, write every single day. Sometimes, that end result took the form of a link post or two or five; alternatively, it may have come as a full-blown article. Regardless of its type or length though, with relatively few exceptions I have written and published <em>something</em> for the past 535 days.</p>

<p>For the first thirteen and a half months, I trudged through this daily slog almost purely out of passion: I wanted my little website to get big, and by God, if I had anything to say on the matter, it would accomplish both those goals and more. And then Jim Dalrymple (!) <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/07/rethinking-web-site-monetization/">linked to one of my articles</a>, and things got&#160;&#8212;&#160;to use a highly-scientific term&#160;&#8212;&#160;crazy: I suddenly had a readership; people started reading my site, others wrote about me and the things I said, and then even more people read about <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I took it all in stride, and then I kicked it into high gear.</p>

<p>I started a newsletter; I wrote more, read more, and posted more; I began interaction with others on Twitter in a meaningful way; I stopped writing my newsletter in an attempt at refocusing my efforts; I redesigned my site, and I redesigned it again. It was a whirlwind of a time, but I somehow made it through. And all the while, I kept writing. Only by now, passion no longer motivated me to sit down every day and write, but rather an intense and visceral fear of losing all I had built over the preceding weeks and months.</p>

<p>At first, I didn&#8217;t notice this shift: I was the frog, page views were the water I had been thrown in to, and popularity was the heat applied gradually so as to, without alarm, calmly boil me alive. But then last week, I awoke: with no choice but to shelve my beloved hobby as I prepared for and took the semester&#8217;s final exams, for the first time in longer than I could remember I had to prioritize something over my writing. I still managed to squeeze <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/social-success.html">an article</a> in there, but again, compared to my normal output, this hardly counted. Then finals ended, I suddenly had a great deal more free time in my life, and... I still chose not to write: I couldn&#8217;t force myself to go back to the drudgery of a life driven by fear.</p>

<p>I suppose you could call this article my <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet">valiant</a> return to <a href="http://curiousrat.com/my-valiant-return-to-reading">writing</a>, then, for indeed I hope that is what I will look back on this as. But in reality, I never left writing: I took a few days off&#160;&#8212;&#160;a minor sabbatical, if you will&#160;&#8212;&#160;and spent some time giving long, hard consideration to the motivations behind my incessant pursuit of excellence within this craft. Now, at the other end of this dark and dreary tunnel, I have finally realized that it&#8217;s time I stopped letting fear push me to write. I used to write solely out of passion, and today, that is once again the case.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-04 12:24:24-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/04 12:24:24 EST</time>
<p>Just a few shows for you this week, unfortunately. I would rather post a short list than pass mediocre episodes off as something much greater though, so I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Without further ado, then, I present the best podcast episodes from this past week.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/pulling-the-string/30">Pulling the String Episode 030: Are We The Same People That We Were A Month Ago?</a>. Ben Alexander talked with Constellation&#8217;s Sound Engineer, Lorenzo Guddemi, in a discussion full of interesting thoughts regarding podcasts, production, and editing, and how those aspects&#160;&#8212;&#160;just as in other areas, such as writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;ought to be combined to make a great product. As somehow who has historically been <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html">very outspoken against the practice of editing for content</a>, this talk proved particularly thought-provoking.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/021-raising-a-human">Technical Difficulties Episode 021: Raising a Human</a>. Even though I have years ahead of me before I get the chance to raise a kid of my own, I have still thought about how I would do so. Hearing from other dads explaining their thoughts on fatherhood and talking about approaches that don&#8217;t necessarily jive with my own idealized process, then, has always interested me; this episode featuring a great discussion between Merlin Mann and Gabe was no exception. I would&#160;&#8212;&#160;and do&#160;&#8212;&#160;listen to any show Merlin appears on; in this case, my blind fandom truly paid off even more than usual.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/169">Back to Work Episode 169: Upgrade Your Skateboard</a>. Using comiXology as a starting point, Dan and Merlin had a fantastic discussion about the nature of business particularly with regards to Apple and Amazon, but applicable elsewhere as well. Turns out, just because something angers you does not doom the company in question to inevitable failure. Unfortunately though, many conflate personal frustration with impending demise. Come for their thoughts on Amazon and comiXology, but stay for the excellent business insight.</p>

<p>Happy May, everyone. As Spring begins to finally come to the States, we approach the season of outdoor activities&#160;&#8212;&#160;hiking, camping, picnics, and the like. And maybe, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have one, a few weekends getting away from it all in a relaxingly isolated cabin out in the woods somewhere.</p>

<p>Swiss Family Robinson, anyone? I would mind getting stranded on an island so much less if I got to live in a treehouse like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/82903227051/towering-treehouse-in-the-hills-north-of-santa">this one</a> north of Santa Cruz in California; so cool. If only I had a big enough tree in my backyard...</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, one of the largest cities in the Czech Republic, Brno, features a neat hanging <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/83114851163/treehouse-in-brno-czech-republic-contributed-by">pod treehouse</a> of sorts. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1391089/Is-dangerous-campsite-world-Pitching-tent-4-000ft-cliff-face.html">these accommodations</a>, except you would have to be slightly less insane to spend a few nights here.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to the previous two airborne quarters, visitors to <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/82998629719/a-toue-shepherds-shelter-in-the-pyrenees">this shepherd&#8217;s shelter in the Pyr&#233;n&#233;es</a> literally live under a rock for the duration of their stay. I&#8217;d love to spend a night hanging from a cliff, don&#8217;t get me wrong&#160;&#8212;&#160;I think it would be an amazing experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I would definitely feel safer here.</p>

<p>Now this is just awesome: a <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/84139004370/mountaineers-hut-in-valais-switzerland">hut in Valais, Switzerland</a> perched atop an what looks like a precarious rock outcropping, surrounded by nothing but snow and other mountains. Looks like someone decided to commemorate <a href="http://afanyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/seuss_crumpet.jpg">the Grinch&#8217;s change of heart</a>.</p>

<p>If you look closely enough, you can see Hansel and Gretel in the distance walking towards what must be the evil witch&#8217;s house. Or at least, that&#8217;s exactly what <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/83536928947/a-magical-cabin-converted-from-a-watermill-by-a">this mill-turned-cabin</a> looks like, sans the candy anyway. Dark, forbidding, rustic, and completely awesome.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-05-02 06:53:19-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-05.html">05</a>/02 06:53:19 EST</time>
<p>Earlier this month Linus Edwards wrote an article he titled <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/4/16/numbers">Numbers</a>, a piece where he posited that metrics-based social networks such as Twitter have made interpersonal interaction a game in which attracting the most attention means winning, and have simultaneously chipped away at the majority&#8217;s ability to maintain real relationships devoid of such concrete numbers and superficial endorsements in the form of likes, favorites, retweets, etcetera. In response to his essay, I countered by questioning the existence of this purportedly unfortunate shift in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/killing-twitter.html">Killing Twitter</a>, and an <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/461122192361926656">interesting conversation</a> ensued. Ultimately, in evaluating the validity of Linus&#8217;s proposed network devoid of all but the most basic of social mechanics, it came down a question of the aspects leading to such a service&#8217;s success. Unsurprisingly, that effectively ended the conversation; but it also got me thinking.</p>

<p>In my final response on Twitter, I used the word &#8220;amorphous&#8221; to describe the difficult combination of tangible and intangible aspects that combine to make a social network successful. I chose that term because we only have general ideas as to what makes these online communities explode in popularity, but as of yet possess little concrete evidence; there is no formula for the next Facebook, and starting a viable competitor in the social space remains significantly harder than even <a href="http://www.coingen.io">creating a new cryptocurrency</a>, after all. Even evaluating success, counter-intuitively and contrary to what many would preach, is in reality nowhere near as straightforward as it might seem at first glance: a one-size-fits-all measurement simply does not apply to these incredibly diverse sites and services, just as it would be laughably foolish to judge every company by the same meter. Amazon <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-amazon-rorschach-blot.html">may not</a> turn <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/mg-siegler-on-amazon-strategy.html">a profit</a>, but that does <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/benedict-evans-on-amazons-profits.html">not signal</a> the company&#8217;s <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/jeff-bezos-is-playing-chess.html">inevitable demise</a> as a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/benedict-evans-on-simplicity.html">viable business</a> even though&#160;&#8212;&#160;at the other end of the spectrum&#160;&#8212;&#160;other corporations like Apple break record upon record with increased sales and extraordinary margins every quarter. Rather than determining merit based on something so <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-for-pageviews.html">imprecise and, quite frankly, crude as pageviews</a>; a measure so fickle, complex, and difficult to quantify as popularity; or another, similarly illogical statistic, then, a much better metric for evaluating a network is to examine the creators&#8217; goals and compare that to the service&#8217;s current status, for it is only at that juxtaposition&#160;&#8212;&#160;the intersection of intentionality and reality&#160;&#8212;&#160;that we will find the elusive answer we seek.</p>

<p>Consider Facebook, for example: if the The Social Network taught us anything, it showed us that the ability to share gossip ranked among the top motivations that ultimately defined and led to Facebook&#8217;s creation; on that front, then, the service does indeed continue to fulfill its initial goal even today. Further, with regards to its secondary-turned-primary aim of facilitating communication between many individuals spread across large distances, Facebook has also attained great popularity for accomplishing this especially well amongst the vast majority of the developed world. In terms of its creator&#8217;s goals, then, Facebook qualifies as a resounding success, and on the end-user side, the desired use case for this service is remarkably similar: the masses wanted a great way to stay in touch with their friends, yes, but a place to gossip about them as well; Facebook fulfilled both those needs, and thus became incredibly popular&#160;&#8212;&#160;a success in the eyes of the masses. So today, no matter how one looks at it, Facebook is a success. Next, let&#8217;s take a look at Twitter.</p>

<p>Twitter started out as a replacement for text messaging, where it succeeded both in terms of its creators&#8216; goals and users&#8217; expectation for a time, then transitioned&#160;&#8212;&#160;excuse me, <em>pivoted</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;to a microblogging platform, where it succeeds remarkably well today in both camps. Although Dick Costolo probably wishes for a better monetization strategy&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least, better results with the current one&#160;&#8212;&#160;for Twitter&#8217;s existing 255 million members, I highly doubt anyone on the development team calls it a failure. Plus, the majority of Twitter&#8217;s users love the service, and so it obviously meets their needs in this area. Like Facebook, evaluating Twitter&#8217;s success is a rather straightforward, then; not so much, however, for Google+.</p>

<p>When Google+ launched in June of 2011, it did so to great fanfare: many heralded it as the next big thing, the be-all end-all social network that would live at the intersection of Facebook and Twitter while simultaneously solving the problems of both. Not everyone felt this way, but such voices made up a small enough faction that the louder, complimentary ones invariably drowned them out. In the absence of any concrete directive from Google as to the explicit purpose of this new social network, the public pushed their own grandiose aspirations onto it in an effort doomed to eventual disappointment. And so today, as a result, nearly three years later, <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/the-tragic-beauty-of-google/">few</a> <a href="bit.ly/1fSQcO9">consider</a> Google+ anything but a disastrous failure, and thus is it painted whenever anyone refers to it.</p>

<p>However, such simplistic, binary thinking fails to take into account the goals for which Google created Google+: whereas the masses expected a Facebook killer, Google had no desire to compete on that front; rather, the company wanted a single sign-on system that could spread across a vast number of sites and services so as to better track individuals and their actions, and in doing so develop more comprehensive profiles through which Google could ultimately deliver more targeted advertising. Knowing few would readily accept such an approach though, Google found itself presented with the question of how to make this new tracking and identification methodology both attractive and acceptable; they found their answer in a hybrid of Facebook, Twitter, and blogging that eventually launched as Google+. Although the network failed in the eyes of almost everyone and therefore often gets cast in a disparaging light, Google+ succeeded in terms of its creator&#8217;s goals. Thus, Google+ is a success: it fulfilled every goal it set out to, and continues to do the same to this day.</p>

<p>I realize this is an unpopular and unconventional point of view, but <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/5665516/sign-in-with-google-button-could-send-google-plus-to-oblivion">Google&#8217;s recent decision to all but abandon the Google+ brand</a> lends it further credence: with Google+ an effectively dead&#160;&#8212;&#160;and perhaps even toxic&#160;&#8212;&#160;brand, Google has begun to forsake it in favor of the more preferred and simple &#8220;Google&#8221; while still making use of the underlying architecture the declining social network was built upon. Again, this by no means indicates a failure on the part of Google+ to gain popularity and traction, but rather a confirmation of the hypothesis I put forth above: Google created Google+ to have a protocol by which they could track and identify their users, not build a Facebook competitor as many supposed. Abandoning the brand &#8220;Google+&#8221; shows that furthering it was never the goal at all. Instead, the goal was to make an underlying, pervasive protocol and give users a superficial reason to willingly sign up. So let me say it again: Google+ was and is absolutely a success, and anyone arguing otherwise fails to understand the purpose for which Google created it in the first place.</p>

<p>Any discussion of the recent social landscape would be incomplete without some mention of the semi-popular App.net that, like Google+, launched to great fanfare, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;like Google+&#160;&#8212;&#160;flopped in terms of public sentiment soon afterwards. The key difference that makes talking about App.net interesting, however, once again lies in the nuanced disparity between the goals of its creators and expectations of its users, and the reality in which it exists. From the onset, an unstable revenue model has plagued Twitter and forced those at its helm to make questionable decisions. Seeing this and the many other problems facing the service and hoping to fix them, Mixed Media Labs created App.net in 2012 with the intention of replacing Twitter. Most importantly though, this goal aligned with the expectations of its users: both parties intended for this new entrant to overtake and, ultimately, obviate Twitter. Many will argue with this characterization, but everything from the design aesthetic to the revenue model by which users paid for access to the maximum post length of 256 characters versus Twitter&#8217;s 140 sought to position App.net as the superior service&#160;&#8212;&#160;and to an extent, those aspects truly did improve App.net; however, for the same enigmatic reasons Google+ &#8220;failed&#8221; in the eyes of the public despite having many of the same features Facebook did, and in some ways improving on them to boot, App.net met with failure shortly after launching. Unlike Google+, though, which attained success in its target area and merely fell short of the aspirations the public pushed onto it preluding its debut, App.net failed in both regards, with respect to its creators&#8216; goals and its users&#8217; desires both. Thus, App.net&#160;&#8212;&#160;by any measure&#160;&#8212;&#160;is a failure.</p>

<p>At this point any further analysis would begin to delve into past social networks such as MySpace or, potentially, even Usenet, but I feel significantly less comfortable talking about those sites than I do ones I have actually used and lived through. Regardless of how far I went back though, the subtle trend I have been alluding to up until now would remain the same: success in this space&#160;&#8212;&#160;and perhaps I would even go so far as to say in every area of both business and <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/define-success">one&#8217;s personal life</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;depends solely on the goals outlined at the onset. Mark Zuckerberg intended for Facebook to become a popular platform for interactions both good and bad, potential users wanted the same, and thus Facebook succeeded. Likewise, the desires of Twitter&#8217;s creators and those of its users align and form both the way in which the service operates and how it gets used, and thus Twitter is a success as well. In the case of Google+, however, this evaluation becomes slightly more difficult: although public opinion considers it a pathetic failure, Google never intended it to usurp Facebook or even Twitter&#160;&#8212;&#160;that was not the intention Google had when creating it; the goal Google did lay out for their fledgling social network, however, it did accomplish, and thus we may call Google+ a success as well. And then bringing it full-circle we have App.net, the one large-scale endeavor of the last few years that truly failed both with respect to the goals of its creators and the desires of its users both. Success, then, depends on your goals, and to judge it by any other measure would be to judge erroneously.</p>

<p>I started with the title &#8220;Amorphous Success&#8221; as a nod to the tweet that inspired me to write this, but mostly because when I first set out to put my thoughts into words I truly believed what evaluating something so subjective as a social network&#8217;s success was, in fact, quite hard. In terms of Linus&#8217;s proposed network, even if he did create it, how could anyone ever truly determine whether it deserved to have &#8220;successful&#8221; appended to any discussion of it? Shortly after I started, though, I realized the difficulty is not in defining success at all, for one can do so simply by looking to the juxtaposition of intention and reality for such an answer.</p>

<p>In the twenty-first episode of his podcast Technical Difficulties, <a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/021-raising-a-human">Raising a Human</a>, Gabe Weatherhead had a great talk with Merlin Mann about, among other things, fatherhood; during that discussion he also mentioned&#160;&#8212;&#160;in passing&#160;&#8212;&#160;how important fairness is to his daughter, even at the age of four. Alongside entitlement, I believe the notion of fairness is one of the single greatest problems facing the American people today: these two touch every aspect of American society, from social interactions to public discourse, to such a degree so as to all but inhibit any meaningful progress in any area. Turns out, as Benedict Evans points out in this piece, unfairness affects the various technological industries as well, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;get this&#160;&#8212;&#160;it isn&#8217;t actually all that terrible there. Shocker, I know, but maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;we could do with some unfairness elsewhere. But, I digress.</p>

<p>Although at this point slightly outdated given Ole posted the original announcement more than two weeks ago, these screenshots of the upcoming ui module as well as an iOS 7 and iPhone version of his acclaimed text editor Editorial are no less impressive. In fact, I would go so far as to call them incredible, and I bet Federico Viticci <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/editorial-1-1-teaser/">would agree</a> with me. So far, I have resisted purchasing a Dropbox-capable text editor on my iPhone out of hope that Ole Zorn would create an iPhone version of my favorite iPad text editor, and now, I&#8217;m glad I did. I can hardly wait for this to come out.</p>

<p>It may sound cute and sensational to write a headline like this, but for Linus Edwards&#8217; recent piece <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/4/16/numbers">Numbers</a>, I don&#8217;t consider it wholly inappropriate. In that article, he first painted a picture of a microblogging service devoid of quantified metrics: no one would have any idea how many followers a given individual had, nor would the person in question. No longer would the best jokes, most insightful comments, and noteworthy observations come from a select few with follower counts in the six, seven, or eight digits, but could instead come from those individuals as well as the everyday user. I won&#8217;t lie: it sounded nice, and for a short while, I was completely on board with this suggestion. However, then he took it a step further.</p>

<p>After proposing a less easily-quantified social network, Linus then went on to remove all but the most basic social interactions from its supposed model. Thus, whereas Twitter&#160;&#8212;&#160;the anti-platform in his piece&#160;&#8212;&#160;not only affords its users access to basic measurements that often correlate to popularity as well as the ability to favorite and retweet posts, antiTwitter would strip away all but the most basic of functionalities. That is, this hypothetical platform would facilitate nothing more than conversations between individuals. Of this, however, I am not so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>There is a certain story we all love to tell, one about the little guy who comes into a space dominated by giants and manages to climb his way up so far that he not only reaches their level, but may even surpass it. And like the plot line from which all others are derived, this feel-good story applies to Twitter as well&#160;&#8212;&#160;and doubly so for those currently at the bottom, staring wistfully at those at the top. But while removing follower counts on either side, or both, may take a step towards leveling the playing field ever so slightly by placing greater emphasis on the content rather than the person saying it, I am skeptical that this is an actual problem.</p>

<p>In my eyes, <a href="https://twitter.com/HarshilShah1910">Harshil Shah&#8217;s</a> opinions have the same inherent value as <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin">Ben Bajarin&#8217;s</a> even though the former&#8217;s followers number less than 150, while the latter&#8217;s come in at just over 6,000. It falls squarely on my shoulders to decide on a per-tweet basis who has formed the better opinion, and the same goes for many others: <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew88fields">Andrew Fields</a> has 41 followers, yet has made some fantastic contributions to tech conversations of late, and so I follow him and <a href="https://twitter.com/monkbent">Ben Thompson</a> both; even though <a href="https://twitter.com/danbenjamin">Dan Benjamin</a> has significantly more followers than <a href="https://twitter.com/badesignco">Ben Alexander</a>, given my personal interactions with Ben, I would be slightly more inclined to follow his advice than Dan&#8217;s. And I could continue through the list of people I follow, but the point would remain the same: I don&#8217;t judge the validity of anything anyone says by their supposed popularity, and I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s quite the case with anyone else either. I don&#8217;t doubt that it happens in some circles, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;just as you must choose the audience you wish to attract&#160;&#8212;&#160;are those the people you really want to follow you at all?</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the issue of favorites and retweets: whereas the effect of removing follower accounts on my Twitter experience would be just shy of nonexistent, I rely heavily on these: when Horace deems something worthy of sharing with those who have similar interests as him, I want to see him simultaneously share that with me while giving the original author credit in the form of a retweet; when Ben Bajarin makes a wry comment about the state of tech journalism in light of a recent data point and associated malformed article, in a situation when a simple &#8220;ha ha&#8221; would seem sarcastic and reductive, a gold star shows him that I appreciated this remark, for I marked it as a <a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/73746142327/that-pointy-thing-on-twitter">favorite</a>. There may not be analogs to these things in real life, we don&#8217;t go around handing out gold stars every time someone says something funny, but we do smile and chuckle; we do go around and say, &#8220;did you hear about what Horace said the other day?&#8221; So when Linus proposes a new social network, or suggests that Twitter and its imposed method of social interaction are depriving us of our humanity, I can&#8217;t help but feel that is the wrong solution, and the wrong place at which to point our condemnatory fingers. In my mind, the problem Linus grapples with here is a systemic one in today&#8217;s society of hyper-connected individuals; and removing follower counts, retweets, and favorites will do little to affect positive change here.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>Just one final note: lately it would seem to be that I have been very critical of&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even harsh towards&#160;&#8212;&#160;Linus and his writing, and that&#8217;s not all the case: while some of the things he writes I&#160;&#8212;&#160;obviously&#160;&#8212;&#160;don&#8217;t quite agree with, I still consider him a fantastic writer with some very interesting thoughts and opinions to share. I still follow him after all this time, after all, and thus these disagreements should not be taken as personal attacks, but rather the natural progression of discourse amongst two people with differing opinions.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-27 19:37:08-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/27 19:37:08 EST</time>
<p>As Bob Dylan once said, &#8220;The times, they are a changin&#8217;.&#8221; Over the past week, this has proved <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/constellation.html">particularly true</a> for the podcasting space: with the launch of Fiat Lux&#8217;s <a href="http://Constellation.fm">Constellation</a>, we have been given a glimpse into a possible future whereby the greatest emphasis falls on the podcast rather than another, ancillary aspect, and this beloved medium has lost the shackles that once kept it relegated to a small, insular sect. At least within this podcasting space, Bob Dylan&#8217;s words have never been more appropriate. Perhaps some day soon, your friends and family will sit down to enjoy episodes of these excellent podcasts alongside you.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/pragmatic/20">Pragmatic Episode 020: The Critical Path</a>. For the first episode of Pragmatic on the newly-launched <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/constellation.html">Constellation</a>, John Chidgey and Ben Alexander talked about Gantt and PERT charts, as well as the field so many just love to hate, project management, and how the principles it is based upon can apply to everyday life. Although skeptical at first, I ultimately found this episode very interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://themenubar.net/podcastfeed/tmb-ep045">The Menu Bar Episode 045: Audio Kool-Aid</a>. This week, in the latest episode of Andrew and Zac&#8217;s philosophical podcast The Menu Bar, they had a fascinating discussion on how and why universes, companies, people, and technology evolve. I have no better grasp on the direction this show is heading than its two co-hosts seem to, but I would be lying if I said I didn&#8217;t like it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-107-built-for-now.html">Roderick on the Line 107: Built for Now</a>. It&#8217;s hard to have so few things that actually need done, yet feel as if you nevertheless have so <em>much</em> to do anyway. Thank you, Merlin, for shedding some much-needed light on this tough issue. In all seriousness though, another great episode of Merlin Mann and John Roderick&#8217;s fantastic podcast, with some real gems this week. I won&#8217;t spoil them here, but I will say that John has finally formed his version of The Avengers and dubbed them &#8220;The Roderick Group&#8221;. Also, the challenge of developing a brand and fostering loyalty, preparedness, and fashion. Before tuning in, it may help to listen to episode 105, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-105-hippie-clean.html">Hippie Clean</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/168">Back to Work Episode 168: It&#8217;s Okay for Cats to Wander Around on Planes</a>. Great episode on expectations through the lens of email, and how managing expectations&#160;&#8212;&#160;both your own and those of your co-workers, bosses, family, and friends&#160;&#8212;&#160;might not mean that you are a lazy person. Even though I have never had a serious problem with email, taking Dan and Merlin&#8217;s advice pertaining to its management and associated complexities out of context and applying it to other aspects of my life proved both insightful and, most importantly, extremely helpful.</p>

<p><a href="http://stratechery.fm/episode-002-fat-as-a-service-faas/">Stratechery.fm Episode 002: Fat as a Service (FAT)</a>. I spent quite a bit of time trying to decide whether or not to include this episode, but ultimately chose to more so out of necessity in that I think everyone speculating as to the future of wearables and Apple ought to hear this episode than anything else. Ben Thompson and Jon Nathanson talk about Apple&#8217;s culture and how it makes the company especially well-suited&#160;&#8212;&#160;and perhaps uniquely so&#160;&#8212;&#160;to developing a wearable not necessarily as the be-all end-all entrant everyone seems to expect, but rather as the requisite stepping stone on the way to greater things.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/seven/1">Seven Episode 001: The Meteor</a>. Neither Ben nor I can quite <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/459751257583136768">agree</a> on just <em>what</em> this show is, but I will say this: it is simultaneously fascinating to hear and remarkably well-done, and thus&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially coming in at a short six and a half minutes&#160;&#8212;&#160;well-worth the negligible amount of time you will have to set aside for it. Haunting, strangely inspirational, and comfortable all come to mind, but none quite capture the gist of what makes this episode so great. Tune in and see for yourself, and then let me know; I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts, and I bet Ben would too.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.fm/shows/designing-creativity/1">Designing Creativity Episode 001: Defining Creativity</a>. In another excellent first episode&#160;&#8212;&#160;or re-launch of episode one, as is more accurately the case here&#160;&#8212;&#160;Ben once again flew solo and talked about creativity: where both the term and the notion originated, and how humanity&#8217;s struggle with the creative process is not a product of Apple inventing the iPad (my words, not his), but rather a continuation of a long-standing difficulty faced by those wishing to bring into existence new and interesting works. Then, to close out the latter half of a tantalizingly short show, Ben touched briefly on some of his approaches to this process. Fantastic&#160;&#8212;&#160;I look forward to episode two more than I anticipate most other shows, it was just that great. If Ben keeps putting out shows this good, I don&#8217;t think I was being <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewjclark/status/459140729277669377">melodramatic</a> at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/a16z/a16z-podcast-apple-and-the-fate-of-tablets">a16z Podcast: Apple and the Fate of Tablets</a>. For everyone who either talks about tablets with any regularity or simple wants to better understand both the space and the challenges it faces better, this episode is a must; Benedict Evans shared some great insights.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/014-everything-sucks-for-somebody-at-some-point">Technical Difficulties Episode 014: Everything Sucks for Somebody at Some Point</a>. Great, great talk between Gabe Weatherhead and Stephen Hackett on charity and charitable giving. Take a step away from the tech-centric podcasts and tune in to this episode for a while. I promise, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

<p><a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/regret-and-focus/">The Weekly Briefly: Regret and Focus</a>. They say that at the end of your life, you will regret the things you didn&#8217;t do more than the things that you did. However, while great advice and on the whole true, it should not be used as an excuse to procrastinate on the real work you do; you will probably regret not doing that more than you regret not playing another round of Call of Duty.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/015-curiosity-and-analytical-thinking-with-dr-drang">Technical Difficulties 015: Curiosity And Analytical Thinking With Dr. Drang</a>. Gabe had the elusive Dr. Drang on for a great episode about creativity, software, and what it means to be an engineer. Shows like this make me glad I listen to a podcast&#8217;s back catalog before tuning in to its newest episodes.</p>

<p>One final editorial note: whereas in previous weeks I adopted the producer&#8217;s naming and numbering convention when linking to podcast episodes in this series, from here on out I will standardize this notation in an effort at increasing clarity and moving towards uniformity. Until next week, then.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-25 11:23:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/25 11:23:31 EST</time>
<p>These days it has become quite common to frame both current events and predictions of the future in terms of the past. Within the technology space, and particularly when talking about Apple, this is especially true&#160;&#8212;&#160;even for me: every time I comment on a rumor, whether in regards to something so trivial as WWDC dates this year all the way up to the much more significant potential screen sizes at which the iPhone 6 could ship, I look to the past. In terms of WWDC, the past indicates it will take place some day in the month of June; turns out, it will run from June second through the sixth. Regarding the potential for the iPhone&#8217;s screen size to increase, Apple&#8217;s historical aversion to changing this aspect of their devices pitted against the fact that they did with the iPhone 5 and a growing desire for a larger device nevertheless makes a larger-screened iPhone a likely proposition. And so, were I a better man, thus would I place my bets.</p>

<p>This historical approach appears very promising, then, as a way to predict the future; however, it is extremely important to remember that it is nothing more than simple extrapolation. Although that process can yield great results, it will only do so after a vast number of data points have been collected. Moreover, extrapolation only works in situations wherein existing trends can be identified, and then either change very little or remain consistent on the interval in question. But Ben Bajarin points out in his recent piece for Tech.pinions titled <a href="http://techpinions.com/history-is-being-made-not-repeated/29463">Tech History is Being Made, Not Repeated</a>, we neither have enough data points to apply historical precedent to the tech industry, nor would doing so serve any real purpose: the very thing that makes this space so interesting and attractive also makes it incredibly unlikely one year will mimic another in but a few minor ways.</p>

<p>Hat-tip to another article from Huckberry, <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/modern-pioneering">Modern Pioneering</a>, that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/modern-pioneering.html">I just linked to</a> for bringing this one from 2013 to my attention.

<p>Ben Thompson has been killing it over at Stratechery lately, especially with this piece comparing Apple and Nike through the apt characterization of experience companies. As a recent convert from the Windows world, I can speak to the reality of Apple&#8217;s unique (within the technology industry, at least) position as such a corporation from first-hand experience: from the outside looking in, I couldn&#8217;t help but want to join this community and become a part of the Apple world. There are undoubtedly those who will discount even the accuracy of Apple&#8217;s designation as an experience company rather than a behemoth fostering a cult of fanatic worshipers willing to pay any sum for their latest POS&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that&#8217;s not &#8220;point of service&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;offering, much less the ability for that to compel anyone to Apple&#8217;s platforms over Windows and Android. However, it is very real. And most importantly, it&#8217;s working.</p>

<p>I doubt it, but who knows&#160;&#8212;&#160;maybe Jeff Bezos has an assistant gather Horace&#8217;s articles every evening, print them onto sheets of newspaper, and insert the pages between those of his morning delivery of The Washington Post. Weirder things have happened before, anyway. To Ben&#8217;s point though, making the distinction between novelty, creation, invention, and innovation is incredibly important regardless of which side of the fence you fall on, whether among those creating products or writing about them. Having a firm grasp of these marked differences will not only inform how one frames emergent technologies, developing market segments, and potential businesses, but the viability of focusing any attention on to any one&#160;&#8212;&#160;or all&#160;&#8212;&#160;of these areas as well.</p>

<p>When writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/rethinking-rss.html">Rethinking RSS</a> the other day, I started reflecting on my process for discovering and consuming new and interesting writing. This time around I zeroed in less on the specifics, though&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-i-do-what-i-do.html">Tweetbot, Instapaper, and Reeder</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;, more on the jobs I use those and other services to complete, and how that methodology could bode ill for the current metric by which website owners determine success, attain profitability, and measure popularity.</p>

<p>If you have spent any time outlining <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/define-success">your version of success</a>, your manifesto likely included at least one reference to pageviews. Many writers believe this a great measure for determining the popularity of their work, and they are not necessarily wrong: great work will, eventually, get noticed; however, predicating your entire self-worth, in addition to that of your writing, on the whims of others is asinine: if Homer came back from the dead today, started a blog at Tumblr, and wrote another epic, the fact that no one read it would not devalue his work in the least. Thus, <a href="http://jamieryan.co.uk/articles/2013/10/25/how-do-you-know-if-youre-successful">as Jamie Ryan once said</a>, &#8220;So no, page views are not a good measurement of success&#8221;.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this is not a groundbreaking revelation: many of the conversations on these topics I have witnessed lately have progressively focused on this imperfect metric less and less. To say that it has completely fallen to the wayside, however, could not be farther from the truth; and in fact, we are very far from reaching a point where we measure &#8220;success&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;however it is defined&#160;&#8212;&#160;by something so intangible as influence (good try though, Klout) and authority. Having come to this unfortunate realization, it begs the question, &#8220;When will we cease to evaluate success, profitability, and popularity based on something so inherently flawed as pageviews?&#8221;</p>

<p>The last time I visited Marco Arment&#8217;s website was for the URL to <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/02/03/headphones-and-coffee">his article on headphones and coffee</a>. Not so that I could read it, though, for I had already done so months prior, but instead so that I could incorporate it into <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/earspeakers.html">a link blog post</a> of my own. Yet, despite the infrequency with which I open Marco.org in my web browser, I have read every single article he has posted since shortly after he and Dan Benjamin started the now-defunct <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/">Build &#38; Analyze</a> in 2010. The same goes for other sites, such as Shawn Blanc&#8217;s and John Gruber&#8217;s: I cannot remember the last time I actually visited either, but I have read every single thing they have written for coming on four years now. Each Marco, Shawn, and John have all seen but a handful of pageviews from me in the last four years, yet I feel confident in ranking myself amongst their greatest fans.</p>

<p>As generic bins with the sole purpose of enabling us to time-shift our reading experience have continued to rise in popularity, pageviews have simultaneously continued to lose their meaning. Today, I can see a link to an article from Shawn Blanc, open it in Reeder, send the URL to Drafts, and write a post about it whenever I have a spare moment, all without ever opening Shawn&#8217;s site. Substitute &#8220;Instapaper&#8221;, &#8220;Pocket&#8221;, &#8220;Pinboard&#8221;, or any other, similar service for &#8220;Reeder&#8221; in that equation, and the problems with this approach become increasingly more obvious. Whats more, I highly doubt that I am alone in this way: those aforementioned sites and services are hugely popular, and for what else than to do exactly what I detailed above&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely, skip the middleman (the site owner) and provide a single location at which to find everything you have deemed worthy for reading at a later date? So let me ask you once more, &#8220;When will we cease to evaluate success, profitability, and popularity based on something so inherently flawed as pageviews?&#8221;</p>

<p>Interesting retrospective by Josh Ginter over at The Newsprint on his time in college and how, then, higher education seemed to approve more of analog note taking than digital, and why. Thankfully, that has largely ceased to be the case: in my last two semesters in college, I can think of only two classes&#160;&#8212;&#160;math and Chinese, for during both those courses a romanized alphabet would have proved virtually worthless&#160;&#8212;&#160;during which no one had a computer out. Aside from those two, it has become par for the course to use some sort of electronic device during class, whether a laptop or tablet, and for the most part teachers have accepted this. Great&#160;&#8212;&#160;but personally, I&#8217;m more of a pen and paper kind of guy; for the foreseeable future, at least, analog will maintain its stranglehold on my classroom experience.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-22 14:53:08-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/22 14:53:08 EST</time>
<p>On April 21st, 2014, a tremor shook the podcasting world. Not a large one, but like an avalanche feeding on itself and growing ever-larger, this quake&#8217;s onset marked the beginning of a significant change. Or at least, that&#8217;s how I think we will look back on the otherwise unremarkable Monday afternoon Ben Alexander, Jamie Ryan, Lorenzo Guddemi, and Sid O&#8217;Neill launched <a href="http://constellation.fm">Constellation</a>.</p>

<p>As Sid pointed out when giving his brief overview of Fiat Lux&#8217;s new podcasting division, this medium is not perfect; in fact, podcasters constantly battle with a number of rather significant flaws. Seeing those, the folks over at Fiat Lux decided to fix two of the most glaring shortcomings inherent to this space in taking strides to improve presentation and accessibility. Whereas previously running a podcast network meant, at best, using SoundCloud&#8217;s built-in&#160;&#8212;&#160;and thus, generic&#160;&#8212;&#160;presentation modules as is the case with Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/a16z">a16z</a> podcast and the shows over at <a href="http://www.muleradio.net">The Mule Radio Syndicate</a>, for example, more often it entails a common audio player for both mid-size networks such as <a href="http://www.ssktn.com">SSKTN</a>, its sibling <a href="http://goodstuff.fm">Goodstuff.fm</a>, and even the venerable <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a> as well. Constellation, however, seeks to change that unfortunate status quo with attractive players front and center rather than seemingly added as an afterthought, combined with a novel approach to show notes and chapter markers reminiscent of Gabe Weatherhead and Erik Hess&#8217;s work over at <a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us">Technical Difficulties&#8217;</a>.</p>

<p>The tight integration of these attractive, mobile-friendly players and a unique take on structuring show notes not only makes for a much more aesthetically-pleasing user experience though, but goes a long way towards improving the other outstanding shortcoming in podcasts as well; namely, accessibility to the unindoctrinated masses. Thus far, podcasts have remained a black box outputting enjoyment whenever nerds input time. Or perhaps more accurately, a heavily-tinted one: although we could&#160;&#8212;&#160;and often do, although to little avail&#160;&#8212;&#160;encourage our friends and family to get real close, squint, and use a combination of timestamps and pull-quotes to provide brief glimpses into the inner-workings of this fantastic medium, short of actually climbing into this box it has proven difficult to demonstrate the motivations behind our unfailing love for these shows. And with a mean length of forty-five minutes<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and most shows lasting much, much longer than that, convincing most to make the initial investment necessary to become a part of this incredible community is a hard sell indeed. Thanks to a clear delineation between topics though, and the ability to jump between talking points afforded those tuning in by Constellation&#8217;s chapter markers, this has suddenly become less of a problem. Perhaps, in time, as others hopefully take a cue from Fiat Lux and seek to increase the accessibility of their chosen medium, podcasts will expand their reach outside this admittedly insular community and in to more populous realms.</p>

<p>Although a great step in the right direction, Fiat Lux has not completely solved the problems of presentation and accessibility with the advent of Constellation&#160;&#8212;&#160;let me be clear on that front; however, that&#8217;s okay: it&#8217;s okay because Ben and company have set off in the right direction, they have done so with a great deal of determination to buck the status quo, and one day soon I have little doubt that they will solve all of these problems and more. Constellation, although perhaps not the most feature-rich platform on the market, is the first in what will one day prove a long line of disruptive distribution platforms within the podcasting industry, and an inspiring glimpse at what we have to anticipate in the coming years. Some will undoubtedly color it a flash in the pan, or relegate it to the pile of stories unworthy of note. I have every confidence in the great team Ben formed to see this version one to its full potential though, so that in the very near future we will all look back fondly on this moment with words of wistful envy for the incredible site that launched yesterday. For on the twenty-first day of April in the year of our Lord two thousand and fourteen, the stars aligned; and on that day, Fiat Lux bore unto us Constellation, and the world of podcasting was forever changed.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;According to Jeffrey Daniel Frey&#8217;s article <a href="http://jdfrey.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/average-podcast-length/">Average Podcast Length</a>, which despite no substantiation does sound like a reasonable number even if his proposition that any podcast could last for &#8220;a few seconds&#8221; is laughable.</p>

<p>Great article and accompanying advice from Leo Babauta on choosing the hard tasks rather than sticking with the easy ones, and how this approach to every aspect of life&#160;&#8212;&#160;while inarguably more difficult&#160;&#8212;&#160;will inevitably lend itself to greater results than the alternative. &#8220;Easier said than done&#8221;, one might say, but that&#8217;s exactly the point.</p>

<p>I know I speak for many when I say that some disruption among the service providers of the mobile phone industry would be very interesting indeed. Unfortunately, as Benedict Evans explains here, this will prove quite the monumental task. Not impossible, but perhaps at the very least prohibitively difficult.</p>

<p>Earlier this month I published <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/owning-their-words.html">Owning Their Words</a>, an article I named for and wrote in response to Matt Gemmell&#8217;s then-recent essay titled <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/own-your-words/">Own your words</a>. In that piece, Matt explained the reasons he continues to write and publish on his own website rather than using a more streamlined venue such as Medium or another, similar service potentially more conducive to greater traffic that his own setup. Doing my best not to spoil his conclusion, that motivation came down to owning every aspect of his words, from the creation process to the manner in which the browser rendered them for his readers. This had a particularly profound impact on me in bringing my long-standing discomfort with the traditional link blog format&#160;&#8212;&#160;whereby its adherents scour the work of other authors, extract the pertinent lines as a pull-quote, and post it on their own site&#160;&#8212;&#160;to a head; by the time I finished Matt&#8217;s article, I had resolved to abandon the format entirely.</p>

<p>I say that, yet my previous post sports a title colored in light green and carries beneath it the hallmark of a hyperlink, that tell-tale underline; below that link, I have appended a brief paragraph of commentary to the aforementioned endorsement of another&#8217;s prose in a move that, I&#8217;m sure, appears awfully hypocritical given my earlier disavowal of the link blog format. But in evaluating my hypocrisy, distinguishing between the structure prescribed by the link blog format and the philosophy driving the vast majority of those who employ it becomes of paramount importance.</p>
<p>To make myself abundantly clear, then, I am not a fan of the structure: as I explained in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/owning-their-words.html">Owning Their Words</a>, I believe to extract the most interesting part of another writer&#8217;s work and publish it to my site, and in doing so potentially removing any incentive for my readers to visit the original article while simultaneously taking that prose out of its intended venue, is to do both myself and the writer I have wronged a great disservice under the guide of showcasing their work. I am, however, very much a proponent of the philosophy that created the practice of the link blog in the first place; that is, the <em>desire</em> to showcase another&#8217;s work alongside your implicit&#160;&#8212;&#160;or explicit, as the case may be&#160;&#8212;&#160;stamp of approval. And so, several weeks ago, that is exactly what I began doing: rather than a pull-quote and a strained attempt at humorous witticisms &#224; la John Gruber, or single-word commentary in a fashion popularized by Jim Dalrymple, I seek to meaningfully add to the larger narrative surrounding the topic in question with something new and insightful I have yet to see someone else bring to the table; unable to do that, I see no reason to needlessly call for my readers&#8217; attention, and so I do not.</p>

<p>We have arrived at an incredibly nuanced distinction here, differentiating between the multiple implementations of the same philosophy in deeming one something so subjective as &#8220;successful&#8221; at its implicit goal while the other a &#8220;failure&#8221;. Like so many spaces touched by the various technological industries though, value lies in the nuanced implementation of an imperfect idea, and that is exactly what we have here: a marginally flawed philosophy that simultaneously sees itself implemented to great effect and to none at all. To categorically condemn this practice, then, as many already have and undoubtedly will once again when the cyclical nature of their thinking comes back around for another pass, is to lump both sides of the same coin, both the good and the bad, together and toss them out as worthless. A weathered penny still retains its value even if the skyward side has succumbed to oxidation and turned a sickly green&#160;&#8212;&#160;just turn it over and inspect the reverse side for validation of its inherent value, and you will find it.</p>

<p>Great counter-point to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-decline-of-the-mobile-web.html">The decline of the mobile web</a> by Ben Thompson, guest posting on Matthew Mullenweg&#8217;s site about the value of the web in a world dominated by apps. An infinite number of apps could be made for infinite number of use cases, but they will still only be designed for those specific use cases; beyond those, there must be something more flexible, able to handle every other possible need. That something is the web.</p>

<p>In preparing to read this article, rather than read it on Chris Dixon&#8217;s website, I first tried in Instapaper. Instapaper failed to accurately parse the article though, so I then created an account at Pocket where I ultimately read and finished the piece before writing about it in Drafts and posting the end result from my computer. Now, as I have explained <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/owning-their-words.html">in the past</a>, this is not usual: for the most part, I prefer to read articles in their intended environment. Ideological values only last so long though, and if that&#8217;s not a damning case for the future of apps over the web, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>

<p>Driving home from a weekend with the family? Boy, have I got just what you need to spice up a few hours of monotonous turns and straightaways: the following list contains all the best podcasts I have had the privilege of listening to within the past week. Whether you&#8217;re out on the open road or simply looking for the diamonds in the rough, look no further than this week&#8217;s installment of my ongoing series, This Week in Podcasts.</p>

<p><a href="http://themenubar.net/podcastfeed/tmb-ep044">The Menu Bar Episode 044: Delight Is In The Spreadsheet</a>. After a few weeks on hiatus and a brief return in the first episode of <a href="http://themenubar.net/podcastfeed/theminibar-ep001">The Mini Bar</a> last week, Andrew and Zac came back and recorded a full-on show with the very special guest Shawn Blanc on Dropbox and its future especially with Condoleezza Rice on its board, learning about and building sustainable businesses, and writing on the internet. My only complaint is that they did not record longer: I could have listened to these three talk for at least another hour, and probably more.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/92">Systematic Episode #92: Ryan Irelan - Fascinating Details</a>. On this week&#8217;s episode of Systematic, Brett Terpstra has Ryan Irelan on to talk about Happy Cog, collaboration, and all the cool projects Ryan spends his time on before Brett derailed the conversation into a forty-five minute tangent on music and Bruce Springsteen. The latter half of the show wasn&#8217;t quite my cup of tea, but I really enjoyed the first half.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asymcar.com/?p=306">Asymcar 12: Cycle Times</a>. Rome, by which Horace and Jim mean the car industry, is burning: as fewer Americans drive annually and it becomes increasingly common for teenagers to eschew a license and car in favor of other methods of transportation, or none at all, the current model upon which this massive industry is built has begun to crumble. When will the inevitable disruption occur, though, and where will it come from? Unsurprisingly, Horace and Jim have some interesting thoughts on that.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/167">Back to Work Episode #167: Second Banana</a>. In the one hundred and sixty-seventh episode of Dan and Merlin&#8217;s Back to Work program, they talked about the state of the comic book industry and its future prospects in light of Amazon&#8217;s recent acquisition of comiXology. I never got in to comics, so I generally take little pleasure in hearing Dan and Merlin discuss this topic outside of any I derive from simply listening to them on-air, but this week proved an exception to this tentative rule: I found their insights into a space almost always superseded by the products of this medium itself very interesting. In a similar vein, Horace Dediu and Mois&#233;s discussed comiXology&#8217;s acquisition by Amazon and the medium writ large in episode #115 of The Critical Path, <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/115">The Canvas of Pixels</a>. If, after this episode of Back to Work, you would like some additional commentary, look no further than this episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://stratechery.fm/episode-001-welcome-to-stratechery-fm/">Stratechery.fm Episode 001&#160;&#8212;&#160;Welcome To Stratechery.fm</a>. In the inaugural episode of Ben Thompson and Jon Nathanson&#8217;s new podcast, the pair discuss more topics than I would have thought possible in such a short ninety-five minutes. To kick the show off, they first talked about journalism and newspapers in an auditory continuation of Ben&#8217;s fantastic <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ben-thompson-on-the-future-of-news-and-newspapers.html">three-part series on the subject</a>, then moved on to Ben&#8217;s decision to take Stratechery fill-time: his reasoning, the lengthy thought process that preluded it, and his strategy going forward. This led to a very interesting conversation on monetization models for personal sites that I plan on returning to when it comes time for me to make a similar jump. Tying these two subjects together, their next point of discussion dealt with the democratization of publishing and how that shift has occurred in tandem with an increased opportunity for individuals to step up and fund content they find spectacular. As any dialog zeroing in on the tricky exchange of cash for content in the consumer realm almost invariably does, this entailed delving in to the current media landscape in which the television, cable and internet service provider, and film industries are competing with entrants like Netflix and HBO for the finite resource that is time and attention. And finally, on the topic of competition between upstarts and incumbents, Ben and Jon wrapped the episode up with a fascinating look at Dropbox, the company&#8217;s play to <em>become</em> the computer much as Google is attempting to <em>become</em> the internet, and Dropbox&#8217;s future plans to rely on software differentiation&#160;&#8212;&#160;much like Apple&#8217;s approach as hardware becomes commoditized&#160;&#8212;&#160;as the price of online storage and the services enabling that access approaches zero.</p>

<p>If my nearly three hundred word diatribe extolling the virtues of this episode was not enough to get my point across, let me state it explicitly once more before moving on: Ben and Jon recorded one of the most interesting podcasts I have had the privilege of listening to in recent memory, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. If even one of the aforementioned topics interests you in the least, clear your calendar, sit down, and lose yourself in their words. And if, for some reason, you cannot carve enough time out for the entire episode, the show description contains timestamps&#160;&#8212;&#160;and links&#160;&#8212;&#160;for each section and associated topic. Brilliant&#160;&#8212;&#160;the show notes and the entire episode both.</p>

<p><a href="http://thevoicemail.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/episode-094/">The Voicemail Episode 94</a>. As usual, James Whatley and Stefan Constantinescu recorded a humorous and insightful episode on the recent happenings in the mobile phone industry. This week, however, it was actually the question and answer section that I found noteworthy. In particular, their thoughts in response to &#8220;When will Xiaomi come to the United States?&#8221; were especially interesting. For anyone speculating as to the future of mobile, and those who don&#8217;t even know what&#160;&#8212;&#160;or who, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;Xiaomi is in particular, you would do very well to tune in to the last fifteen minutes or so. And while you&#8217;re at it, listen to the other twenty-two as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/92">CMD+SPACE Episode #92: A New Lingua Franca, with Horace Dediu</a>. In this the latest installment of Myke Hurley&#8217;s popular interview show, Horace Dediu of Asymco talks with Myke about his background, what makes for a great analyst and presenter, and where he falls on that nuanced continuum. This segued nicely into an examination of the smartphone industry&#8217;s early days, and wrapped up with a brief aside focusing on Horace&#8217;s latest projects Air Show and Significant Digits before closing with the genesis of the name &#8220;Asymco&#8221;. As has become par for the course for Horace, his presence and Myke&#8217;s interviewing prowess made for an excellent show.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/146">Ruby on Rails Podcast Episode #146: Horace Dediu of Asymco - Open Source Software</a>. For all of Horace Dediu&#8217;s fans out there, this has been a spectacular week: in addition to guesting on CMD+SPACE, he also made an appearance with Sean Devine to talk about the open-source movement and explain how the principles upon which it was founded have touched everything from the scientific method to modern-day capitalism. Later, the pair discussed the capitalist&#8217;s dilemma and the innovator&#8217;s dilemma, and how the two might just be one and the same applied to different market segments. Fascinating.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/a16z/a16z-podcast-the-future-of-television">a16z Podcast: The Future of Television</a>. Interesting, albeit short, talk between Benedict Evans and Zal Bilimoria theorizing as to the future of the television industry. These consistently short episodes are both a blessing and a curse: while I can count on Benedict and his co-host to get right to the point, I often find myself wishing they spent a bit more time explaining their nuanced opinions, and doubly so when they disagree. Nevertheless, an interesting discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/kids-and-touchscreens/">The Weekly Briefly: Kids and Touch Screens</a>. Great discussion between Shawn Blanc and Stephen Hacket on the challenges of raising a kid today where not only is technology embraced by the vast majority of society, but an addition to it is as well. Even if you don&#8217;t have a kid, tune in: their thoughts on striking that difficult balance between realizing all the wonderful advantages technological advances afford us and going too far in that direction by shutting the rest of the world out are probably just as applicable to your own life as they would be a child&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Josh Horwitz, writing for Tech in Asia, conducted a great interview with Ben Thompson about his decision to go solo, and his background as a writer in the tech sector. If you&#8217;re still on the fence as to whether you should become a member of Stratechery or not, both this interview and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2014/04/16/tech-blog-stratechery-goes-freemium-ben-thompson-strikes-indie-writer/">another article from The Next Web by Jon Russell</a> on Ben&#8217;s transition to independent writer ought to convince you. Ben knows what he&#8217;s talking about: he has an impressive background that gives him fantastic insight into modern-day events within nearly every industry technology touches. And even at $30 a month&#160;&#8212;&#160;disregarding the existence of the two lower membership tiers at $5 and $10 a month&#160;&#8212;&#160;access to those insights is a steal.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-18 06:10:41-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/18 06:10:41 EST</time>
<p>Until a few days ago, I was the cautionary tale; everyone told my story leading up to a punch line in which some unfortunate schmuck lost everything after a malevolent hacker gained access to one of his online services. Despite his best efforts, an obscure&#160;&#8212;&#160;or not so obscure, <em>ahem</em> Heartbleed&#160;&#8212;&#160;security breach had given an attacker access to one of this poor individual&#8217;s passwords, and although he had selected lengthy combinations and varied them slightly from service to service, they ultimately remained only marginally different; he had to keep them all straight in his head, after all, and so after the initial break-in, determining the appropriate combinations to everything else from Gmail to bank accounts proved relatively easy for his maligned attacker. Thankfully, it never actually got as far for me as it did for our hypothetical <a href="http://bit.ly/QnJRDO">Job</a>. It could have, though, and that realization has weighed heavily on me for quite some time now.</p>

<p>Although I had taken a step in the right direction a few months ago when I began using iCloud Keychain to generate strong, randomized passwords that my Apple devices could, theoretically, keep track of for me, I never quite felt satisfied with this solution: not only did Safari often fail to properly recognize and populate the appropriate fields both when logging in to existing accounts and creating new ones on my Mac, Mobile Safari supported this key feature even less: it proved incapable of generating passwords when creating new accounts on my iPhone, and also rarely remembered to fill in the complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols it had previously generated for me when I wanted to use a service for which I already had an account. Having handed every aspect of my password management over to Apple in exchange for the promise of greater security and a streamlined user experience, this inability to manage and use my passwords consistently was completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>And then, as if to add further insult to injury, iCloud Keychain completely owned my passwords. If I had for some reason become unable to use my Mac, whether through my own fault or another&#8217;s, I would have had no way to recover or even access this information, let alone the accounts and services it unlocked: iOS had proven next to useless for this task, and short of a full-disk backup&#160;&#8212;&#160;a great thing to have on standby in its own right, but not as the sole solution for recovering my Gmail password&#160;&#8212;&#160;I had no feasible alternatives. I would have lost Twitter, Instapaper, Feed Wrangler, and every other online service I spend hours with every single day. And unable to open my email, I would have been able to do absolutely nothing about it. Needless to say, this made me extremely uncomfortable, and so a few days ago, at around nine o&#8217;clock at night, I decided to do something about it.</p>

<p>Ever since I can remember, I have heard and seen ads for 1Password all over the place: during all the best podcasts, and on nearly every one of my favorite websites, everyone whose opinion I respect seems to hold this program in incredibly high esteem. And so, looking to drastically improve the sad state of my password management system, I decided to give the critically-acclaimed application a try. $33.98 and two hours later, I had 1Password on both my Mac and iPhone, and was well on my long journey of changing all my passwords; by the following afternoon, I had 1Password set up to work with every online service I used regularly, and had changed every one of those passwords in the process.</p>

<p>Less than twenty-four hours had elapsed between my overdue acknowledgment of my lacking security precautions, and fixing the situation. Less than twenty-four hours, just over thirty dollars, and such a minor expenditure of effort I feel embarrassed that I did not deign to set this up earlier. For peace of mind and security that I no longer have to fret over every time a massive data leak occurs, those were well worth the price.</p>

<p>As of yesterday, Ben Thompson has gone indie: after <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ben-thompson-on-the-future-of-news-and-newspapers.html">a three-part series</a> examining the decline of newspapers and the role of individual writers in this new world order, he took his own words to heart in crafting an impressive business model consisting of three membership tiers, each chock-full of some very compelling offerings. Along with an excellent new weekly podcast called <a href="http://stratechery.fm">Stratechery.fm</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;whose first episode, <a href="http://stratechery.fm/episode-001-welcome-to-stratechery-fm/">Welcome to Stratechery.fm</a>, I plan to cover at length in this week&#8217;s installment of This Week in Podcasts&#160;&#8212;&#160;he intends to publish much more often and in this way make writing for Stratechery his full-time job. I <a href="https://stratechery.com/membership/">became a member</a>, and I hope you will too; we could use more intelligent analysis in the tech industry these days, and Ben Thompson is just the man for the job.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-17 07:19:10-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/17 07:19:10 EST</time>
<p>My relationship with RSS, while not exactly turbulent, has remained fairly amorphous over the last few years. In the Google Reader era, I used RSS occasionally to keep up with a handful of sites using Google&#8217;s now-defunct service, an iOS app called Feedler, and then, later, Feedler Pro&#160;&#8212;&#160;you could say I was moving on up in the world. Following Reader&#8217;s demise, however, I had to change things up a bit as I simultaneously lost my primary tool for participating in this medium and became much more enthusiastic about it. Unable to find any suitable web-based alternatives capable of syncing across multiple platforms though, I opted for the somewhat cumbersome route whereby I pointed my latest iOS RSS client, Reeder, directly at the RSS feeds I wished to track with. In other words, rather than signing in with a Google Reader account, I pasted the feed URLs directly into Reeder and let the app take care of the back-end work previously fulfilled by Google. Although this had the benefit of cutting out my reliance on middlemen, it came with one major downside: no sync whatsoever. Thus, unless I wanted to scroll through the same list of feeds multiple times for each device&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I did not&#160;&#8212;&#160;I could subscribe to and read these feeds on one device only.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I chose my iPhone, and for more than a year my setup stayed the same: Reeder checked forty-two individual feeds every time I refreshed the client, and all was well in my world. Recently, however, I have begun thinking seriously about my workflow as the desire to expand the number of sites and writers I subscribe to has increased. With only so many hours in the day though, I had three options: stop following someone for every new writer I decided to follow, give up the desire to expand my sphere of influence, or become more efficient. I chose the third option, which meant decreasing the costs incurred when discovering new content as well as the signal to noise ratio. Previously, I had done just that on Twitter using Tweetbot&#8217;s excellent Mute Filters.</p>

<p>Faced with similar problems of wanting to follow more people than I had time for on Twitter, as well as a high signal to noise ratio, I used some of the suggestions Jamie Ryan made in his article <a href="http://jamieryan.co.uk/articles/using-mute-filters-to-make-twitter-better">Using mute filters to make Twitter better</a> to do just that: make Twitter better. By cutting down on some of the unnecessary accounts I followed there and applying liberal mute filters for everything else I found undesirable, I vastly improved this experience. With success there, then, I decided to take a similar approach with RSS using <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/06/feed-wrangler-smart-streams/">Feed Wrangler&#8217;s Smart Streams</a>.</p>

<p>Today, I have Feed Wrangler as my back-end syncing engine, keeping all my clients in sync. Notice I say &#8220;clients&#8221;, because I now have more than one: whereas previously I consumed RSS exclusively on my iPhone, I now have Reeder on my Mac and my iPad as well. This makes for a much more enjoyable reading experience, to say the last, and a much convenient one as well. More importantly though, thanks to Feed Wrangler&#8217;s Smart Streams, I was able to cut down on the abhorrent &#8220;20 things we learned from X movie&#8221; listicles, and incorporate high-volume sites known for putting great content out, like The Atlantic, in a very unobtrusive way. This transition has not only affected the way I discover new and interesting work, though, but may even branch out and alter the way I consume that work later on as well.</p>

<p>Whereas I used to save everything to Instapaper prior to reading it, recently I have found my use of its core feature&#160;&#8212;&#160;an aesthetically-pleasing reading environment&#160;&#8212;&#160;increasingly less useful. Rather than reading everything post-Instapaper sanitization, I have come to use it as a generic repository for everything until I re-open the pages on their respective sites. This shift has not only affected my collection mechanism, then, but may go so far as to fundamentally change the way I consume prose in the future as well. One step at a time, though; for now, let&#8217;s stick to consumption.</p>

<p>Huckberry takes us on a nostalgic trip to a bygone era I fear we will never experience again. Aspiration, decency, and pride are all vanishing from America at much too rapid a pace these days, and that rate has only continue to increase in recent years; Nicholas Pell is right to be saddened by their untimely and unfortunate passing, for once our society loses these values I doubt we will ever see them come back.</p>

<p>After Marco Arment posted his great article on <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/02/03/headphones-and-coffee">fancy headphones and fussy coffee</a> back in February, I strongly considered dropping $180 that I&#160;&#8212;&#160;to be brutally honest&#160;&#8212;&#160;didn&#8217;t have on a pair of <a href="http://amzn.com/B008POFOHM">Beyerdynamic DT-770-PRO 32ohm closed dynamic headphones</a>. Whether fortunately or unfortunately, I still cannot say, sanity won out though, and I abstained from blowing a week&#8217;s salary on what I have no doubt would have been a fantastic listening experience. As both Linus and Marco explained though, you don&#8217;t have to spend a ton of money on great headphones just to have a good time listening to your music: take the advice of a few trustworthy people, spend within your means, sit back, and enjoy.</p>

<p>In scene reminiscent of Steve Jobs&#8217; dismissal from Apple at the behest of John Sculley, Brendan Eich lost his job as CEO of the Mozilla Corporation a few weeks ago over a political donation made roughly six years prior in support of California&#8217;s Proposition 8. A bill that sought to ban gay marriage in the state, it&#8217;s easy to see why Eich took such flack for that move in today&#8217;s hyper-sensitive political landscape permeated by the rantings of faux-political activists. Although a federal court ultimately struck it down as unconstitutional, the fact that his donation ultimately had no lasting effect mattered not to nearly everyone that weighed in on the controversy, and least of all to Sam Yagan. CEO of OkCupid, Sam Yagan played a key role in Eich&#8217;s ultimate impeachment by acting as one of Eich&#8217;s loudest opponents.</p>

<p>Then, as if taken directly from a comedic sketch, in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/palpable-irony.html">a fantastically ironic turn of events</a> last week, it came to light that Sam Yagan <em>did the same thing</em> a decade ago: in 2004, Yagan made a $500 donation in support of Congressman Chris Cannon despite his reputation for acting in direct opposition of anything to do with homosexuals. In fact, I would make the case that Yagan&#8217;s donation was actually <em>more</em> damaging than Eich&#8217;s given that whereas Proposition 8 had a single, explicit purpose, politicians can lobby for any cause they set their minds to. What&#8217;s more, whereas the judicial system can rule ballot initiatives unconstitutional, the process is much less clear-cut when it comes to the whims of politicians. Nevertheless, more than a week after that information surfaced, nothing has changed: Eich remains jobless, Yagan remains OkCupid&#8217;s CEO, and this entire debacle has nearly faded from the public&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>Almost.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/453887384627978240">a lengthy Twitter exchange</a> after I published my take on the news of Yagan&#8217;s hypocrisy that sort of went in circles until <a href="https://twitter.com/LinusEdwards/status/453979736285642752">Linus Edwards brought me back on track some six hours later</a>, I attempted to explain why I feel Sam Yagan ought to lose his job just as Brendan Eich did. In an effort at introducing some clarity to a conversation that otherwise had little, let me briefly explain myself once again: I care little for what Eich did six years ago, and just as little for what Yagan did a decade back. Further, I do not agree with the argument that we ought to hold these individuals accountable in a <em>professional capacity</em> for the choices they made in a <em>personal one.</em> Thus, regardless of what cause Eich lobbied for and donated to, so long as that does not influence his innate ability to lead, I do not believe anyone should have the right to lobby for his dismissal, and the same goes for Yagan; however, Yagan does not believe in the same principles I do. Instead, he believes in holding others accountable for their actions made years prior; he believes in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/31/okcupid-offers-firefox-visitors-links-to-alternate-browsers-to-protest-new-mozilla-ceo/">public shaming</a>; and be believes in advocating for others&#8217; removal from their jobs based on a combination of the two. In calling for Yagan&#8217;s dismissal, I merely ask that the same standard he so vociferously put forth prior to Eich&#8217;s resignation be applied to himself as well. He believed in this methodology to such an extent so as to cost a man his career; why not judge himself by the same metric? Yet he has not, and to me, that double standard is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Not surprising in the least, but nevertheless completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Impersonal, cold, and calculating, perhaps, but pragmatic, practical, and logically sound? Yes again. Milo Yiannopoulos has a very interesting approach to relationships. And today, in an age where anything less than four digits worth of Facebook &#8220;friends&#8221; has somehow become strange, it might not be such a bad idea. Food for thought, anyway.</p>

<p>Turns out you are not the only one battling with a lack of conviction in your own self worth and the value of the things you create, and struggling with the fear that at any moment someone might discover that you are, in fact, the fraud you so strongly believe yourself to be. In reality, we all struggle with these complicated feelings&#160;&#8212;&#160;you, me, and I would bet anything your role model does as well. In the somber words of <a href="http://the-blacklist.wikia.com/wiki/Raymond_Reddington">Raymond Reddington</a> though, &#8220;There will be nightmares. And every day when you wake up, it will be the first thing you think about.

<p>Fascinating article from Silviu Tantos of Iconfinder on developing an algorithm to detect duplicate images using just a few lines of Python. Having written the back-end for this site myself, completely in Python, I plan on using some of these tactics extensively in version 1.0 to streamline and improve my process for determining when and how often to re-build this site.</p>

<p>Following the BUILD conference, there has been a great deal of uncharacteristically positive talk within the Apple sphere with regards to the products and services Microsoft recently unveiled there, as well as the new direction these announcements seem to indicate. In particular, Myke Hurley, Stephen Hacket, and Federico Viticci of The Prompt had an interesting discussions on these topics in the forty-second episode of their podcast, <a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/42">Beautiful Flower</a>, as did John Gruber and Ed Bott in episode <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/78/">seventy-eight of The Talk Show</a>, recorded live at BUILD. These two shows forced me to rethink the class of writers I follow, for I can no longer confidently state that Apple is the only company making anything interesting. So I set out to find some writers from the other side of the fence&#160;&#8212;&#160;onces not wholly focused on the iOS ecosystem, that could provide valuable insight into a company quickly regaining its relevance in today&#8217;s tech scene. Or at least, I decided to; I have yet to succeed.</p>

<p>A Google search for something along the lines of &#8220;Microsoft blogger&#8221; will return millions of results. What&#8217;s more, this has long-since ceased to be the best way to discover interesting writers. As I started looking, then, I realized the importance of knowing what to look for in these near-innumerable articles across the internet. I have no interest in following someone who constantly rails against Apple, after all; why would I want anything less from someone on the other side of the fence? I sought a writer whose opinions, at least to some extent, aligned with mine. Not to such a degree that my views would not be challenged and I would not come away having learned something, but I needed some common ground upon which I could reconcile this person&#8217;s opinions with mine. In order for that to happen though, I needed an opinion of my own; I needed to nail down the way in which I would frame these articles with regards to the way I thought about Microsoft, for only after that point could I make any meaningful progress. Thanks to the two shows cited above, this proved relatively easy.</p>

<p>Microsoft is an investment company. More than a software powerhouse, the corporation behind Office, or the firm that achieved its goal of Windows on every computer in the world, Microsoft is a company that makes investments that occasionally appear asinine at their inception, but often prove worthwhile in the long run. Take the XBox, for example: only after pouring money into that platform for years did Microsoft see any return on their investment in the game console industry, and now they vie with Sony for the industry&#8217;s top spot.</p>

<p>Bing, too, is another long-term investment, this time in search. Like the game console market, search is an industry that would probably have consisted of one obvious choice and a few smaller, obviously sub-par ones that nevertheless manged to subsist on the scraps Google deemed too small to scoop up had Microsoft not formed a viable alternative. Set your own opinions of Bing aside, look at the move objectively, and that is exactly what Microsoft&#8217;s entrance into the search industry was: a play to break up Google&#8217;s monopolistic stance on search and maps. And as Apple&#8217;s integration with Bing rather than Google for Siri suggests, at least some people appreciate that.</p>

<p>More so than anything else, Cortana included, this is the reason Microsoft built Bing. Behind the scenes, for years amidst the mishaps and failed products, Microsoft has been fighting its own holy war, of sorts. Not because they had to, though, for their nest egg, Office, has&#160;&#8212;&#160;for the most part&#160;&#8212;&#160;remained safe; rather, Microsoft shouldered these burdens because they could, and because it was the right thing to do. And right about now, it looks like those investments are starting to pay off. Good for them&#160;&#8212;&#160;and great for us; it&#8217;s time Apple had a real competitor. Turns out Samsung couldn&#8217;t make the cut. Can Microsoft? Everything I know about this space tells me &#8220;No&#8221;, but I think the right answer just might be a &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the past week was relatively light in terms of new podcasts, and even more sparse with regards to great episodes. There are always a few, though, and this week was no different.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/78/">The Talk Show Episode 78: Live From Build 2014</a>. In the previous installment of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-33114.html">This Week in Podcasts</a>, I linked to episode forty-two of The Prompt where Myke, Stephen, and Federico gave Microsoft&#8217;s BUILD keynote and the announcements made during it a pretty fair shake, and rightly so: Microsoft has started doing some very interesting things once again. This week, in the latest episode of The Talk Show, John released an episode recoded live at BUILD with Ed Bott, where they spent the entire show talking about Microsoft. Microsoft is becoming both exciting and relevant once again; I&#8217;m going to have to start looking for some Microsoft bloggers to follow.</p>

<p>Also worth noting, in addition to a great discussion between two obviously very intelligent and hilarious individuals, every aspect of this show relating to its production was exceptional: by any standard, and especially when considered as a live recording, the audio quality was superb. And the ad reads as well, put in in post (generally making for a jarring and poor listening experience) so as not to do them at BUILD, were done phenomenally with the help of Siri. Genius. If I could make one suggestion for podcasts recorded live, although not specifically this episode, I would suggest that the hosts mic the audiences better: take advantage of the fact that you have a live audience present and, in some cases, responding, and incorporate that into the show. All in all, though, a great episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/010-going-back-to-school-with-julia-richert">Technical Difficulties 010: Going Back to School with Julia Richert</a>. As an incoming college freshman this fall, I found Gabe Weatherhead and Julia Richert&#8217;s conversation on higher education and its challenges very interesting. A worthwhile episode for everyone involved in college, regardless of whether that be as a future student or a current one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-33-ken-ferry-auto-layout-passbook-and-understudy">Debug 33: Ken Ferry on Auto Layout, Passbook, and Understudy</a>. This week on Debug, Guy English and Rene Ritchie had Ken Ferry on for a great all-around interview about his time at Apple working on Cocoa, Auto Layout, and Passbook, as well as his current project, <a href="http://www.imore.com/understudy-brings-mentored-learning-ipad-age">Understudy</a>. Especially in the last twenty minutes or so, they all had some very interesting ideas about education.</p>

<p><a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/urgent-vs-essential/">The Weekly Briefly: Urgent vs Essential</a>. It&#8217;s hard to do what we have to with so much of our focus relegated to the wrong things.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/quit/49">Quit! Episode #49: In My Apartment You&#8217;re Popular</a>. After a brief hiatus, Dan Benjamin and Haddie Cooke returned with some characteristically great advice this time focused on preparing to strike out on your own and start your own thing.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-11 21:09:50-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/11 21:09:50 EST</time>
<p>Continuing to riff on Brian Hall&#8217;s recent piece for Tech.pinions, <a href="http://techpinions.com/you-blow-my-mind-o-satya-o-satya/29137">Panic Inside Apple and Cheers for Satya</a>, that I linked to in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nowatch.html">my last post</a>, I want to spend some time talking about another topic of his article: the iPhone 5C. Lately there seems to have been a great deal of talk about the 5C as a failed product that missed the target Apple set out for it by a gross and (apparently) indicative-of-impending-doom margin. I could not disagree more, though; and in fact, I would go so far as to say that every piece painting such a bleak picture belies the author&#8217;s fundamental misunderstanding of exactly what the 5C was and was <em>not</em> created for.</p>

<p>Just as the iPhone 5 was not a cheap phone&#160;&#8212;&#160;in fact, it was (and remains) one of the best devices in the mobile phone industry&#160;&#8212;&#160;neither was the iPhone 5C cheap; the iPhone 5C <em>is</em> the iPhone 5: it has the same internals as last year&#8217;s flagship device, at the same price the 5 would have decreased to had Apple elected not to modify their mid-tier model. It is <em>not</em> Apple&#8217;s attempt at a budget device. Trust me, when we see a truly budget offering from Apple, it will differ in more ways than a simple plastic shell. Rather, the 5C <em>was</em> a play to make last year&#8217;s tech more interesting, especially to historically low-end buyers. Famously, the smartphone industry features very little differentiation amongst platforms, and even less between models from the same manufacturer. The 5C attempted to change that, and among a certain demographic, <em>it worked</em>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it was all these things&#160;&#8212;&#160;last year&#8217;s internals, a less expensive casing, and an attractive outer shell&#160;&#8212;&#160;all in service of a play for higher margins on a device that Apple would have sold anyway. The 5C was not remarkably successful, in no small part because it was not <em>supposed</em> to be remarkably successful. Apple creates a new flagship device every year for a reason, after all. The 5C was geared towards the low end, but it was not aimed there, and that is an incredibly important distinction to make when considering any aspect of this device. For everything it was supposed to do, it succeeded. We must be careful not so superimpose our own aspirations and goals over top the real aspirations and goals at hand.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to violate <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/owning-their-words.html">my cardinal rule of not using a pull-quote</a> for this article by Brian S. Hall, for to simply point you at his recent piece for Tech.pinions and expect you to grasp the pertinent thread out of the three near-disparate topics within would be a fool&#8217;s errand. Although ostensibly about Microsoft, more accurately yet another critique of the 5C, and with a tired subtext of the usual &#8220;Apple is doomed&#8221;, I see no other recourse but to hand you the appropriate portion on a silver platter. From <a href="http://techpinions.com/you-blow-my-mind-o-satya-o-satya/29137">Panic Inside Apple and Cheers for Satya</a>, then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We are, after all, still well into the evolutionary phase of smartphone and tablet computing. This year&#8217;s iPhone, this year&#8217;s iPad, will be better than last year&#8217;s. Next year&#8217;s will be better still. And so on and so on. But a revolutionary new product? One that can live outside of the iPhone or iTunes sphere? Do not expect any such breakthrough product or service anytime in the near future from Apple. Apple is on a very direct course, set by Tim Cook, with its mission being to ensure the iPhone continues to print money. A low cost iPhone would have threatened the vision Cook holds for Apple&#8217;s future. It&#8217;s a vision I believe is almost guaranteed to succeed yet also highly predictable.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short of coming right out and declaring my lack of confidence in the seemingly inevitable Apple smart watch, I have thus far remained <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-question-of-value.html">very critical</a> of its value proposition. Apple could undoubtedly build an iWatch, market such a device, and sell it in droves&#160;&#8212;&#160;of that, I have no doubt. But <em>should</em> it? We can sit here and make the case that Apple must, in order to remain competitive, create such a device; we can pontificate all day long, saying that not doing so and instead &#8220;merely&#8221; continuing the current trend of ongoing innovation within existing product lines would signal an inability to innovate on Tim Cook&#8217;s part. Set those facile arguments aside though, for they have little to no bearing on both this conversation and Apple&#8217;s future plans. A more apropos query, rather, would question whether Apple can afford to shift its resources to this project, at the expense of its other offerings, for such ephemeral reasons. Apple made a name for itself through the years as the company that did not release a product until it was ready&#160;&#8212;&#160;perfect in every sense. Perhaps it&#8217;s time Apple returned to the values that served it so well in the past.</p>

<p>Turns out, vanity searches pay off: earlier this evening, my girlfriend pointed an article out to me of particular interest. Writing for Fast Company Labs, Jenna Kagel published <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024517/inside-one-bloggers-plan-to-make-money-without-hideous-ads">Inside One Blogger&#8217;s Plan To Make Money Without Hideous Ads</a> on January seventh of this year, where she recounted my plans to take this site from a cost center to a profitable enterprise detailed in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html">Doing Monetization Well</a>. To me, to have a site so popular and widely-respected as Fast Company post an article about something <em>I</em> wrote and posted to <em>my</em> site, that&#8217;s just awesome; so very cool.</p>

<p>This is so cool. Back when I used to write exclusively on my iPad, I nearly did this so that I could copy a finished article to my clipboard, and then simply tap on a home screen icon to publish it using Pythonista rather than opening the app as an intermediary step between creation and pushing it up to my server. Then I got my MacBook Pro, though, and it became my primary writing device. I doubt this will remain the case forever, so I plan on keeping this one in my back pocket.</p>

<p>Despite it&#8217;s oxymoron of a title, this is a great piece by Felix Martin for Wired drawing some interesting parallels between Bitcoin and the monetary system of sixteenth-century Europe. Bitcoin has enjoyed a great deal of support up until now, but the jury is still out as to whether it will turn in to a viable, stable currency or go down in history as a somewhat lengthy flash in the pan. Hopefully, though, for the reasons Felix laid out in his conclusion, Bitcoin will.</p>

<p>Fantastic article by Jon Lovett at The Atlantic, where he writs about the power of free speech particularly with regards to internet culture. In my mind, these two issues have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/discrimination-comes-full-circle.html">collided</a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/palpable-irony.html">come to a head</a> recently with the resignation of Mozilla&#8217;s CEO Brendan Eich: given the political nature of the reasons Eich lost his job, I have seen a great number of people on both sides of the issue speak up, out, and often vilify each other.

<p>After I posted <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-question-of-value.html">A Question of Value</a> the other day, where I talked about some important questions to ask when evaluating the plausibility of a smart watch as a viable future device category, Linus Edwards sent me a link to a very interesting and thought-provoking piece of his from July of 2013 titled <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2013/7/25/where-did-the-time-go">Where Did The Time Go? The Failures Of Technology</a>. Part of the reason I found it so noteworthy, though, is because I disagree with it so strongly: I disagree with his statement that &#8220;In terms of design, most computing devices, programs, operating systems, and websites are not designed to simplify people&#8217;s lives, but rather make people more and more reliant on those computing devices, programs, operating systems, and websites.&#8221; He lumped all these very different mediums together and categorically condemned all of them for the more pronounced shortcoming of one or two, a process that I feel he used to form the erroneous conclusion that he then wrote his article in service of.</p>

<p>For clarity&#8217;s sake, let us oversimplify the app market and divide it into two distinct categories: games, and everything else. While the latter&#8217;s modus operandi varies from app to app, members of the former almost invariably do everything <em>but</em> streamline their users&#8217; lives. With regards to this subset, then, Linus has very accurately captured the fundamental problem with this class of app, because games often do everything in their power to engage their audience to the greatest degree possible, and for as long as possible, in order to remove as many of your innate inhibitions when they ultimately send the in-app purchase dialog box in.</p>

<p>Similarly, most websites these days achieve profitability through ad revenue. Thus, keeping their users active, engaged, and returning has become of paramount important. Here, too, though, we may draw a dividing line between such websites and those belonging to independent writers, or those who recognize the unsustainability of this model and look to realize an alternative one. Consider <a href="http://techpinions.com">Tech.pinions</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.theinformation.com">The Information</a>: wholly supported by their readers, both have but two ways to achieve greater popularity and, thus, profitability: continue creating great content, and attract fantastic writers. Through these ways only will Tech.pinions and The Information grow, for they have no incentive whatsoever to keep their readers on their respective domains for any longer than necessary to read the latest article.</p>

<p>On a smaller scale, independent writers like Shawn Blanc and Jim Dalrymple, with virtually no ads on their sites, instead attain the majority of their revenue through tasteful forms of sponsorships and site memberships. Thus, as is the case with both The Information and Tech.pinions, neither Jim nor Shawn need to lock there readers in anywhere near as much as they need to continue creating exceptional content in order to sustain and continue building a strong readership. Although the net effect of this desire to encourage returning users remains the same across each category of app and website, the key difference lies in the reason those users choose to spend their time with a particular writer or app, and what motivations prompted that decision: whereas the pursuit of greater revenue and mindshare motivates those less in touch with their morality to use various psychological tactics in achieving those ends, the latter&#160;&#8212;&#160;those independent writers&#160;&#8212;&#160;draw motivation from the desire to continue providing value to their readers&#8217; lives, and in doing so create exceptional content. The former attains your money through underhanded tactics; the latter, you happily hand over a few dollars every month, or, not any at all&#160;&#8212;&#160;either way, they stick around, because they love the writer&#8217;s craft and sharing their thoughts with others. If you have any doubt as to the reality of what sounds like an impossibly noble set of motivating factors, just listen to one of these creators speak: it comes through in everything they say.</p>

<p>With regards to computers, Apple has no incentive to make any one of their offerings&#160;&#8212;&#160;hardware or software&#160;&#8212;&#160;take more of your time than absolutely necessary. Whether the iPhone or a Mac Pro, iOS or Mac OS, introducing unnecessary entropy for the sake of keeping users engaged, for any amount of time, would only take away from the platform as a whole. In the end, then, this strategy would not increase engagement, but instead decrease it dramatically as once-loyal users fled to platforms more respectful of their time and attention. A computer or operating system that does not streamline one&#8217;s life will inevitably find itself tossed to the wayside for one that does, and the same goes for individual programs running atop that combination. DELL machines running Linux went nowhere for a reason, after all.</p>

<p>Computers do take up more of our time today than they used to, but they do so because we have become vastly more empowered by them. Granted, some apps, programs, and websites take slightly-less-than-morally-sound approaches to engaging with their users and thus artificially boost time spent in their environment past what it deserves by virtue of its merits, but this is not an inherent problem of technology at large; do not condemn the many for the faults of a few. More so than the time these devices demand of us increasing, it is instead <em>our</em> demands of those devices that has increased over the years. Therein lies the explanation for where our time really went: it went to computers, mobile phones, and the internet. More important than that somewhat obvious realization, though, is realizing why that shift occurred, and that it was wholly our choice.</p>

At the time, at seventeen myself, I laughed; however, a couple of years later the same thing has become true of myself: very few things annoy me as much as hypocrisy these days, and the very closely-related phenomenon of the double standard drives me insane. Today, in a fantastically ironic turn of events that came to my attention through <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2014/04/08/okcupid-ceo-once-donated-to-anti-gay-politician/">an article on SFGate</a>, <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2014/04/06/the-hypocrisy-of-sam-yagan-okcupid/">UnCrunched discovered that OkCupid&#8217;s CEO, Sam Yagan&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of the most vocal critics of Brendan Eich&#160;&#8212;&#160;once supported a congressman known for his huge opposition of anything to do with homosexuals</a>. The same man who played such a pivotal role in the ruin of Brendan Eich&#8217;s career, claiming that his support of California&#8217;s Proposition 8 nearly a decade ago made him an abhorrent individual unfit to lead Mozilla, supported a congressional candidate that <em>goes even farther than Proposition 8 did</em>. Absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>After the debacle with Brendan Eich, I hope to see the petitioning for Yagan&#8217;s removal as OkCupid&#8217;s CEO within the next twenty-four hours. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/discrimination-comes-full-circle.html">I did not support Eich&#8217;s removal from Mozilla in the first place</a>, but now that his career has gone down the tubes thanks in large part to Sam Yagan&#8217;s actions, anything less than the same outcome would be an incredibly inappropriate double standard of judgment. The public has decided that political contributions made even a decade ago can come back to haunt the donors, as evidenced by Eich&#8217;s removal as Mozilla&#8217;s CEO after just eleven days; it&#8217;s time to apply that precedent to Sam Yagan as well.</p>

<p>Last week Ben Thompson recommended that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ben-thompson-on-the-future-of-news-and-newspapers.html">anyone who enjoyed his three-part series on the future of news and newspapers</a> check out Nieman Journalism Lab&#8217;s latest report on the state of news media in 2014. For anyone interested, here&#8217;s the link: <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/03/new-technology-new-money-new-newsrooms-old-questions-the-state-of-the-news-media-in-2014/"><em>New technology, new money, new newsrooms, old questions: The State of the News Media in 2014</em></a>; at the time, I was: I promptly saved the essay to Instapaper and eagerly awaited reading it. However, a little more than a week later, I got through the first two paragraphs before completely losing interest. Yet, ten days prior I read more than three thousand words on this subject, spread across three different articles. What changed?</p>

<p>After a bit of thought, it came to me: whereas Ben presented the former in the form of a narrative, Justin Ellis&#160;&#8212;&#160;writing for Nieman Journalism Lab&#160;&#8212;&#160;created the latter more akin to a collection of facts than an enjoyable body of prose. Some more consideration revealed that this was not unique to these two writers: although I find the heavily analytics-based AnandTech reviews of Apple&#8217;s latest devices very interesting, I take a lot of joy in reading more qualitative pieces from people like John Gruber, for example. Each sub-genre has its place in tech journalism, but I, for one, prefer writers who can spin a narrative out of the same set of facts other writers use to piece together dry reports. That, to me, is what separates good writers from the great ones.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the constant vilification of America&#8217;s top 1<code>. Some call them &#8220;captains of industry&#8221;, others have much more choice combinations of nouns and verbs to describe the small subset of Americans that earn substantially more than everyone else&#160;&#8212;&#160;the constantly marginalized 99</code>&#160;&#8212;&#160;as if they somehow did not deserve their hard-won success. This article from The Atlantic does not go as far to dispel that ridiculous notion as its title&#160;&#8212;&#160;doctored above, originally &#8220;How You, I, and Everyone Got the Top 1 Percent All Wrong&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;might lead everyone to believe, but I guess it&#8217;s a step in the right direction.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-07 10:21:38-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/07 10:21:38 EST</time>
<p>When small handheld computing devices went mainstream, they did so by <a href="http://xkcd.com/1348/">replacing boredom</a>. I recognize that this supposition seems rather reductive and perhaps more than a little stretched in pursuit of achieving comedic effect, but consider the situations many use their mobile devices in, and what they use them for: often, people employ the latest iteration of this category, smartphones, to stay boredom in a checkout line, provide an escape from the drudgery of a lengthy commute, or to avoid interacting with others in what could otherwise prove an awkward or otherwise unpleasant situation. Yes, there are other use cases&#160;&#8212;&#160;communication, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the majority of those additional situations fall within one of the previously-described ones. Thus, the jobs consumers hire this category of computer to do has remained mostly constant throughout the short time period from going mainstream until now.</p>

<p>However, this was not always the case: at the dawn of the personal computing age, these devices&#160;&#8212;&#160;in the form of small tablets roughly the size of modern-day smartphones, yet unable to maintain a constant internet connection&#160;&#8212;&#160;were geared towards the business archetype despite failing so spectacularly to accomplish needs we would today consider deal-breakers. Yet, the inevitable march of progress kept them relevant as processors shrunk, battery capacity increased, and screen technology improved. Natural progress took care of all but one area of differentiation: the incorporation of additional capabilities. This is, in no small part, why Steve Jobs felt such a need to emphasize &#8220;mobile phone, iPad, internet communicator&#8221; in that 2007 keynote, and why that combination proved so revolutionary at the time: whereas the incumbents had adopted a model of incremental improvement, Apple aimed for the one aspect they did not in forever raising the bar for what it meant to build a handheld computer.</p>

<p>With that keynote, the iPhone met all the requirements consumers demanded of such a device, and added a few more for anyone seeking to entire this market thereafter. Therein lies its genius, the reason the iPhone became one of the most sought-after commodities in the developed world, and why we have seen so little volatility with regards to its core feature set over the last seven years. Apple has no incentive to add anything radical because no one needs any more features from their iPhone than it debuted with in 2007, and that the inevitable march of progress will not naturally take care of. Conveniences like Touch ID, yes, but thus far no one has clamored for significant features not present in the first generation iPhone such as an expendable antenna or built-in stylus, for example.</p>

<p>However, even if the iPhone did fulfill every desire its users asked of it, it still fell short in some other areas. Not necessarily out of an inability to perform competitively at such tasks, but more so because it was simply not the right tool for the job. The screwdriver on your pocket knife might work just fine for the job, but given the opportunity few will choose it over the one in their toolbox. Thus, leading up to April of 2010, Apple had an open space in their lineup between the iPhone and their Mac line&#160;&#8212;&#160;a gap that, on April third, Apple filled with the iPad. Positioned as a more capable iPhone due to its larger screen, the iPad became the go-to computer in the majority of corporate environments where other, obviously inferior devices had previously reigned supreme, and that&#8217;s to say nothing for the public sector where it has enjoyed incredible popularity. After its initial release, in possession of the requisite capabilities to become a suitable device for all consumers, the march of progress took over and today, as is the case with the iPhone, the iPad receives incremental updates to improve upon the core set of competencies present in it&#8217;s first revision.</p>

<p>The iPhone was born of a need unmet with previous handheld devices; the iPad was born of a need unmet with other attempts at desktop-class computing in a form factor more portable than a laptop or god-awful netbooks. In both cases, the iPhone and iPad both solved a problem and obviated an entire class of device. Thus, we can use these two questions&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;What problem will this device solve?&#8221; and &#8220;What device will this obviate?&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;as a measure for the possibility of success when evaluating the plausibility of a new category. These are questions every consumer will have to answer when deciding whether or not to purchase such a device, after all, so it is important that this be a clear and easily-discoverable value proposition. For no one has infinite time, and as mobile continues to eat the world&#160;&#8212;&#160;and our time&#160;&#8212;&#160;we must begin to make sacrifices, choosing one device, product, or medium over another. Moreover, this proposed class of device has the added challenge of entering a landscape already occupied by entrenched devices and players who have proven their worth time and time again&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, for an entire generation, have done so for as long as they can remember.</p>

<p>So what problem will these wearable devices solve? What device, product, service, or medium will they obviate in a play for a portion of our finite time? Defining that, as Jim Dalrymple said in commenting on <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/04/02/one-third-of-consumers-abandoning-wearables/">a post published last week</a>, truly is key.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-06 20:28:36-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/06 20:28:36 EST</time>
<p>Another week, another seven days of spectacular podcasts. Maybe I&#8217;m just biased, but this is my favorite medium in existence&#160;&#8212;&#160;even more beloved than television, film, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;yes, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;writing. So sit back, relax on your commute for once, and tune in to some of the best podcasts on the internet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-30-casey-liss-c-and-net">Debug 30: Casey Liss on C&#35; and .Net</a>. As usual, Casey Liss made for a very interesting guest when he sat down with Guy English and Rene Ritchie to talk about C and its derivative languages. As someone who never really understood nor took any joy from writing C, I found this discussion of its benefits and drawbacks particularly interesting. Leave it to these guys to make talking about pointers interesting.</p>

<p>I have to confess, I didn&#8217;t listen to these three episodes within the last week as I profess to do with all the entries in this series. Rather, I actually listened to the first and second episodes of Technical Difficulties&#160;&#8212;&#160;formerly Generational&#160;&#8212;&#160;while in San Salvador over spring break. Having just finished working my way through the back catalog of both <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug">Debug</a> and <a href="http://commonplacebooks.com">Night Vale</a> though, and looking for a new show to start on, I started on this one yesterday through which I realized my oversight.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/001-being-the-it-help-center">Technical Difficulties 001 - Being the IT Help Center</a>. I distinctly remember playing this episode on a small, fourteen-seater turboprop flying over The Bahamas on my way to Nassau. Even over the near-deafening din of those engines just feet away from my seat, though, I still found Gabe Weatherhead and David Sparks&#8217; advice on getting new computer users up to speed both interesting and insightful. In particular, David&#8217;s suggestion on teaching family and friends simply how to formulate a good Google search as a great first step to solving their problems was genius.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/002-preparing-for-the-worst-case-scenario">Technical Difficulties 002 - Preparing for the Worst-Case Scenario</a>. No one will ever say too much on the topic of backups, and in the second episode of his podcast Gabe Weatherhead had Eddie Smith on to talk about this important&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, unfortunately, oft-overlooked&#160;&#8212;&#160;practice. For more on backups, if this episode interests you as much as it did me, check out the second episode of John Siracusa&#8217;s now-retired Hypercritical podcast, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/2"><em>Backup Vortex</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/003-do-it-for-the-kids">Technical Difficulties 003 - Do it for the Kids</a>. In the third episode, we get to the topic for which the show was originally named: the intersection of parenting and technology. Although it&#8217;s still far too early for me to have to worry about such things, it certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt to start thinking about how I would raise a child in an age more reliant on technology than any before.</p>

<p><a href="http://fiatlux.fm/pragmatic/18">Pragmatic Episode 18: Mediocrity, Consensus And Perfectionism</a>. I have missed the live recording sessions early Saturday mornings greatly since they stopped a few weeks ago, but that has in no way affected the excellence of this show. In this episode, John and Ben talk about leadership, compromise, and dealing with group dynamics especially when attempting to implement a good design process. As someone who worked his way through the more unsavory versions of these experiences last year as part of a large high school robotics team, John&#8217;s criticisms hit very close to home for me. It&#8217;s easy to think these issues are unique to large corporations, but in reality, both the problems and the lessons they can teach will apply to the vast majority of your life.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/90">CMD+SPACE Episode #90: The First Bar, with Merlin Mann</a>. Myke has had Merlin on CMD+SPACE a few times in the past, so when I saw his name pop up in Instacast over the weekend I was pleasantly surprised. As usual, neither disappointed in any way: first Merlin and Myke talked about a topic very near and dear to my heart, podcasts, and then the creative process as it pertained to writing, building an audience, and the corporate world. Unsurprisingly, an excellent episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-104-talismans-of-a-dead-age.html">Roderick on the Line Ep. 104: &#8220;Talismans of a Dead Age&#8221;</a>. This week, John and Merlin strike a fantastic balance between profound and hilarious in one of my favorite episodes in a while. If you still don&#8217;t listen to this show, think of this as #104 in a one hundred and four-item-long list of reasons you ought to start.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esn.fm/thank-you-for-calling/5-backblaze-case-study">Thank You for Calling 5: Backblaze Case Study</a>. In the most recent episode of this just recently-launched show, Moises continues a trend of excellence in talking with the founders of what is arguably the best online backup solution currently available about&#160;&#8212;&#160;you guessed it&#160;&#8212;&#160;their approach to not just customer support, but customer service as well. In particular, I enjoyed hearing from Yev Pusin: he had some great stories, spoke very eloquently, and had that charismatic personality that just made for a really great interview segment.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/amplified/93">Amplified &#35;93: Doc Oc Arms</a>. This week, Jim and Dan talk about April Fools, going independent, and some perspective on wearables and how the differing approaches of the companies creating them makes comparing public progress an apples to oranges comparison. Later, they continued this topic in talking about how Apple wants its users to think about computing power, before moving on to the first music section I&#160;&#8212;&#160;as a non-musician&#160;&#8212;&#160;have ever enjoyed. I could listen to Jim play his guitar all day long.</p>

<p><a href="http://m.imore.com/debug-32-john-siracusa-copland-2014">Debug 32: John Siracusa on Copland 2014</a>. When the show notes say, &#8220;John Siracusa of Hypercritical and the Accidental Tech Podcast shows up to fight with Guy over Copland 2014&#8221;, they mean just that: John and Guy really did have a &#8220;spirited&#8221; argument that, although most of it went over my head, I still managed to find simultaneously interesting and enjoyable to listen to.</p>

<p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/03/27/why-everybody-who-doesnt-hate-bitcoin-loves-it-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">Freakonomics: Why Everybody Who Doesn&#8217;t Hate Bitcoin Loves It</a>. I generally cannot stand public radio shows and those that take strong cues from those types of broadcasts, but I overcame that aversion for this episode of Freakonomics where the hosts explained Bitcoin&#160;&#8212;&#160;the underlying technology, its value proposition, and speculated as to its future. I personally prefer Chris Dixon and Balaji Srinivasan&#8217;s discussion recorded as part of the a16z podcast, <a href="http://a16z.com/2014/03/20/a16z-podcast-the-state-of-the-bitcoin-ecosystem-and-a-theory-on-satoshi/">The State of the Bitcoin Ecosystem, and a Theory on Satoshi</a>, but many of the show&#8217;s guests made some very interesting observations and points. This one is worth checking out.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/42">The Prompt Episode #42: Beautiful Flower</a>. This week, Myke, Stephen, and Federico gave the Windows BUILD keynote an uncharacteristically (for the average Apple-centric computer user) fair shake, and spoke highly of the services and features announced during it as well. Although I can&#8217;t speak from firsthand experience, and from what little I have heard so far it seems Microsoft exaggerated the capabilities of Cortana and could have done the same in other areas as well, at least the ideas coming out of Redmond are interesting and worthy of attention once more. Especially with regards to Cortana&#8217;s alleged abilities and integration with third-party apps, I hope Apple will take a cue perhaps for iOS 8. And speaking of other companies Apple will hopefully take a hint from in the future, Russell Ivanovic of Shifty Jelly had an interesting correspondent report where he talked about the Play Store and how Google far outclasses Apple when it comes to supporting their platform&#8217;s developers. Take note, Apple.</p>

<p>As usual, an interesting article from Sam Dogen at Financial Samurai. Especially within this microcosm of independent app developers and writers, it has become so common to hear the story of a full-time employee striking out on his own that this piece nearly took me by surprise: rather than leaving his large company and setting up a one-man shop, Sam is considering returning to the corporate nine-to-five lifestyle he left in 2012. Even more interestingly, his reasons make a lot of sense. I would love to go independent at some point in my life, but there is certainly some appeal to being a corporate stooge.</p>

<p>Last week when I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hedge-yourself.html"><em>Hedge Yourself Before They Wreck Yourself</em></a>, I talked about the regrettable situation we have found ourselves in with regards to the discourse around issues like sexism. Rather than affecting meaningful change, this community has grown into a hodgepodge of pseudo-activists more concerned with the lexicon used in furthering their professed cause than actually making any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, this divergence has led to a great deal of hostility, confusion, and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/always-on-vacation-in-california.html">outright unwillingness for well-meaning and concerned individuals to participate whatsoever</a>. Thankfully, this culture of misplaced priorities and general disrespect of their fellow human beings has yet to permeate the discussions surrounding another important social issue, ageism; however, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/youth-problem.html">we likely have little time before it, too, becomes infected in a similarly deplorable way</a>. For all my condemnatory prose, though, I never talked about actually having an opinion one way or the other: I opined against a community that would discourage anyone from sharing their personal beliefs, but said nothing of a culture that actively discourages <em>having</em> a belief.</p>

<p>Over the past two or three weeks, time has seemingly moved in fits and spurts: first, Malaysian flight 370 disappeared somewhere in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean, and for a while it seemed as if news outlets&#160;&#8212;&#160;and especially CNN&#160;&#8212;&#160;covered nothing else. Then, within the last week or so, it came to light that Brendan Eich had made a donation in opposition of gay marriage in California some eight years ago. Again, time stopped and it seemed as if everyone had nothing else to cover. Although we still await a conclusion to the former, closure came to the latter in the form of Brendan Eich&#8217;s resignation as Mozilla&#8217;s CEO yesterday. Surprisingly&#160;&#8212;&#160;to me, anyway&#160;&#8212;&#160;not everyone has hailed this announcement as the win so many unfairly characterize it as.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone has a right to privacy, and thus we&#160;&#8212;&#160;the collective we that acted as judge, jury, and executioner in Brendan&#8217;s recent trial by mob&#160;&#8212;&#160;have no business intruding into anyone&#8217;s personal life. As the Chief Executive Officer of a large organization, we have the responsibility to hold Brendan accountable for his actions in that capacity; however, in his own life, so long as those views do not bleed into his decisions as Mozilla&#8217;s head, we have no right to criticize his choices, let alone crucify him for one made nearly a decade ago. Yet we&#160;&#8212;&#160;again, the collective we that devotes more attention to someone referring to a female as a &#8220;girl&#8221; than affecting measurable change&#160;&#8212;&#160;have chosen to make Brendan Eich&#8217;s personal business <em>our</em> business, and I can&#8217;t stand for that. To my surprise, this morning I found that I was not the only one who felt this way: in an article posted using Day One&#8217;s new Publish feature, Sam Bradford questions whether causing the fall of one man&#8217;s career can actually be thought of as progress in <a href="https://dayone.me/6fczsc"><em>Is hounding a man out of a job for their views on gay marriage progress?</em></a>.</p>

<p>In that short post, Sam also links to an article by Ed West at The Spectator titled <a href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/04/the-mozilla-controversy-suggests-that-the-sexual-revolution-is-getting-ugly/"><em>The Mozilla controversy suggests that the sexual revolution is getting ugly</em></a>. Both these articles are not only excellent pieces taking position rarely seen these days, but very prescient ones as well. To give you the gist without actually spoiling either, their argument boils down to this: the movement for equality up until now&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether with regards to sexual orientation, gender, or race&#160;&#8212;&#160;has been just that: one for equality&#160;&#8212;&#160;the recognition of more than heterosexual white males as important individuals in American society. Over the years though, that struggle has become so politically charged&#160;&#8212;&#160;and for good reason, for without the multitude of loud voices crying out time and time again no meaningful change would have ever been realized&#160;&#8212;&#160;that now, with the pendulum nearing the midpoint and on the verge of swinging towards the opposite side, we are at risk of going too far in the <em>other</em> direction in crucifying anyone <em>with</em> a divergent opinion. Whereas at one point falling in to the categories of homosexual, African-American, and/or woman was cause for discrimination, it has become the norm to discriminate against anyone not explicitly in support of one of those factions. The minority has transitioned into the majority if not in numbers, then in vocality, and then promptly proceeded to marginalize and do to the previous majority exactly what they suffered through and ultimately rose up against.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Sam Bradform, <em>how</em> is this progress?</p>

<p>In a brief departure from his daily Tab Dump series, Stefan Constantinescu wrote about the LG G Flex. He did not write a review though, but instead a rather introspective essay about how the single advantage to this device and what that signaled for the future of the mobile phone industry. Quite a while has passed since the 5S came out, and even longer since Apple did anything new with their flagship phone&#8217;s form factor. We have already seen releases from the other major smartphone players, and it&#8217;s about time Apple added to the cacophony. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they come out with.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-03 07:57:15-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/03 07:57:15 EST</time>
<p>Spoiler alert: <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hedge-yourself.html">sexism</a> isn&#8217;t the only social issue holding up progress within the tech industry at large. A few weeks ago, I read a great article by Yiren Lu titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html"><em>Silicon Valley&#8217;s Youth Problem</em></a>, where she explained how a preference for young entrepreneurs combined with the type of projects they tend to work on has created an unsustainable culture of front-end innovation built atop outmoded technology. She later went on to detail how that unfortunate amalgamation will put us in a poor position in the near future as the march of progress falls victim to increasingly restrictive constraints when the underlying technologies powering that advancement become unable to sustain further progress. Then, just yesterday, I cam across another, similar article&#160;&#8212;&#160;this time from New Republic&#160;&#8212;&#160;by Noam Scheiber titled <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117088/silicons-valleys-brutal-ageism"><em>Silicon Valley&#8217;s Brutal Ageism</em></a>.</p>

<p>Building on what appears to be a fledgling trend of articles railing&#160;&#8212;&#160;and rightly so&#160;&#8212;&#160;against ageism within what is arguably America&#8217;s technological epicenter, Noam continued this discussion in the context of those creating the businesses rather than those building the products said companies sell. Telling the story of a perpetually-confounded entrepreneur stymied time and time again not for lack of trying, nor for a dodgy track record, but by a mixture of prejudice against his age and a preference for younger, less experienced &#8220;entrepreneurs&#8221;, Noam took this issue often tossed to the wayside every time sexism strolls through and made it a real topic of concern for me in a way that even <em>Silicon Valley&#8217;s Youth Problem</em> could not. More so than these individual articles though&#160;&#8212;&#160;for although they are, in fact, very good in their own rite, they are not the topic of this article&#160;&#8212;&#160;I want to focus on the phenomenon that inspired their creation in the first place.</p>

<p>It seems as little as a year or two ago, few talked about the problem of sexism within the tech industries. On the semi-rare occasion that those discussions did surface, however, I feel like they almost invariably moved the cause forward in some respect or another. If I had had the foresight to devise a way to measure the number of superfluous sexism articles to those actually affecting change at the time, I feel reasonably confident in positing that the result would have been a surprisingly high ratio in favor of the correct side. Lately, however, that has ceased to be the case: faux-feminists permeate the collective discourse, and through their misguided beliefs they justify personal attacks over the most trivial offenses while, ironically, ignoring the larger issues they profess to actively work against. Unfortunately, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-feminist-who-cried-wolf.html">this has led to a net decline within this microcosm</a>, and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/in-defense-of-entangled-bank.html">encourages others to adopt the same <em>modus operandi</em> of ultra-sensitivity</a> that got us here in the first place. The temptation to call this a lost cause is now great, for even <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/always-on-vacation-in-california.html">those with the purest of intentions see the risk of participating in this discussion now greater than the potential benefit</a>; sexism has devolved from a righteous social cause to an impersonal risk-benefit analysis, and that&#8217;s an unfortunate shift indeed. We ought not completely extinguish all hope for a brighter future quite yet, but as every day passes it becomes increasingly hard to affect positive change in this space mired in worthless arguments over lexicon and nuanced, unintended subtext.</p>

<p>Ageism, on the other hand, has yet to become the politically charged and, if I&#8217;m honest, rather disgusting topic non-conducive to any degree of intelligent discussion that, unfortunately, sexism has morphed in to somewhat recently. How long before this topic, too, finds itself in a similar position though, having undergone the same unfortunate transition that the collective discourse around sexism did? For how much longer can we reasonably expect to make any significant progress in this area before the faux-anti-sexism advocates cross over and ruin this as well? For our sake, I hope never; however, I would be lying if I didn&#8217;t expect it all to come crashing down in the very near future.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-04-02 08:09:02-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-04.html">04</a>/02 08:09:02 EST</time>
<p>When I started this website, I did so with the same intentions many decide to set up a blog these days: post often and about topics that interest me, and link to the work of others in between. In short, I set out to model my website after the likes of John Gruber, Shawn Blanc, and Marco Arment, back when the latter two published with much more regularity. By any measure, I succeeded: I wrote regularly, posted often, and occasionally made something interesting enough to spawn some intelligent discussions. I succeeded by adopting a proven format, even though I did little to improve upon it. Towards the end of last year, I began the difficult process of rectifying that.</p>

<p>I have always admired John Gruber for his success, although his style&#160;&#8212;&#160;not so much. For a while I really got behind the philosophy that justified a link post<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> devoid of anything but a pull-quote by saying that nothing more than the original author&#8217;s words need be said on the topic, and to add something else would be to introduce unnecessary fluff to the conversation. I believed in that mantra in no small part because it was convenient, and in large part because I had seen the likes of John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple&#160;&#8212;&#160;titans of this industry&#160;&#8212;&#160;attain incredible success through it. Every so often a debate, one that inevitably morphed into a flame war, would pop up questioning some aspect of this practice: the ethicality of allegedly passing off another&#8217;s words as your own, for example, or whether in doing so the link blog&#8217;s adherents actually added anything to the larger narrative at hand. I generally ignored those discussions, though&#160;&#8212;&#160;I was in the right, after all. Turns out, not so much.</p>

<p>Within the first few days of February, I finally quantified the result of my misgivings regarding this tried tactic in <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/430740658174038016">a tweet</a>, roughly fifteen months after my first post went live:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my goal never to use a pull-quote in a link blog post. If I can&#8217;t add to the surrounding conversation, I shouldn&#8217;t be linking to it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shift had been a long time in coming. Over the preceding weeks, I had begun to see its effects in everything I wrote: I posted fewer &#8220;articles&#8221; containing nothing but the greatest parts of another author&#8217;s best work; the number of long form pieces I produced also increased as I sought to actually add something to the larger conversation, and ended up writing as a result. This piece, in fact, stemmed from that very process: I set out to write a short commendation of Matt Gemmell&#8217;s recent article <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/own-your-words/"><em>Own your words</em></a>, and before I knew it I had written five paragraphs and nearly five hundred words. All in all, then, this change has been a remarkably advantageous one: every writer wishes to become more prolific, and I managed to do so with (that clich&#233;d phrase) &#8220;one simple trick.&#8221; My motivations were not quite wholly selfish, though; don&#8217;t judge me quite yet.</p>

<p>By its very definition, the practice of running a linkblog<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> entails searching for excellent content, extracting the appropriate amount without going so far as to anger anyone enough to raise their plagiarism banner, and then posting it <em>in your place</em>. As I explained earlier, although I ignored most of the arguments against this strategy, I was not unaware of them. And even though I managed to keep myself one step removed from the criticisms constantly lobbed at those who capitalize on this format, they still affected me enough to get me thinking. And the more I thought, the less comfortable I became.</p>

<p>I, personally, have no problem if someone takes this paragraph and puts it on their site providing they do so with some obvious attribution. But doing that to the work of others, I became increasingly less comfortable with. In the parlance of Matt Gemmell&#8217;s aforecited post, I had made taking others&#8217; prose outside of <em>their place</em> and putting it into <em>my place</em> a habit, and found that realization a bitter pill to swallow. By &#8220;showcasing&#8221; their work I was not doing them a favor, and certainly not contributing to the surrounding conversation; in reality, I had taken any incentive for my meager readership to read another&#8217;s writing by extracting the most pertinent paragraph and squashed it, subconsciously hoping that in the process I could drive more traffic to my own site by capitalizing on the brilliance of another individual in the same situation as me. I did not own their words, yet I passed them off in place of my own all too often. It was upon realizing this that I set out with the goal of actually contributing something worthwhile, to creating something worthy of my then-virtually-nonexistent readership&#8217;s time, and provide an additional incentive for someone to go read whatever great article I found and posted to my website besides the sound reasoning and excellent craft that got it there in the first place.</p>

<p>Rather than using a pull-quote as a way to lend credence to my implicit endorsement of a particular site or article, I started writing single-paragraph summaries in which I talked about exactly what I found so compelling in the linked item, why I thought my readers ought to take time out of their busy day to read said piece, and where to go after reading it. I completely stopped using any pull-quotes whatsoever; if I had nothing concrete to say with regards to that article in my Instapaper queue, it had no place going on my website. I had done the writers I respect a disservice up to that point, because I do believe, as Matt Gemmell does as well, that your writing belongs nowhere but <em>your place</em>. I had robbed my readers of the privilege to read some <em>great</em> work in the venue through which the original author intended, but no longer: I do not mean to say that you should not continue upon the path of the linkblog, but it is no longer a path for me. I have decided to blaze my own trail; follow, if you like.</p>

<p>After last month&#8217;s post, I feared for the future viability of this series as I continued an apparent trend of finding fewer and fewer cool links for each of these issues. After the last few weeks, however, I&#8217;m convinced that those slow months were flukes: this time around, boy have I got some great cabins to show you. Let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://tiny-project.com">The Tiny Project</a>, then, a small house built on a trailer that features beautiful architecture and well thought-out design. Very impressive&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would be more than happy to live in one of these, traveling around the country with the comfort of home just a few feet from my steering wheel. Maybe some day.</p>

<p>The folks over at Beaver Brook, the ones who run Cabin Porn, are publishing a book. I linked to the page <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-the-book.html">earlier this month</a>, but if you haven&#8217;t signed up for the waiting list, go ahead and put your email in there now: it will be money well-spent, of that I am sure. I can&#8217;t wait to put this one on my shelf.</p>

<p>Speaking of Beaver Brook, I just discovered their tumblr. If you enjoy Cabin Porn and want to see other, similar pictures that never see the light of day on CabinPorn.com, check the parent site out. <a href="http://beaverbrook.com">Beaver Brook</a>.</p>

<p>Although lacking in the rustic aesthetic I love so much about the majority of cabins I link to here, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80001115355/handcrafted-chestnut-yurt-built-by-guy-mallinson">this handcrafted chestnut yurt</a> in England definitely deserves a link. How cool&#160;&#8212;&#160;I could definitely spend a few days living in this; and to build one? Sign me up.</p>

<p>Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by mountains. Although the &#8220;mountains&#8221; I have climbed in the past could have been more accurately described as very large hills shooting no more than one or two hundred feet into the air, the allure was no different than the larger ones I see pictures of across the world. Take the Swiss Alps, for example, and <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/the-solvay-hut">the Solvay emergency hut</a> located partway up the cliff face: the perfect combination of my two favorite things in the world.</p>

<p>Mike Belleme doesn&#8217;t have a treehouse, he has <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80257859712/photographer-mike-bellemes-treehome-outside">a <em>treehome</em> outside Asheville, North Carolina</a>, and it&#8217;s awesome. I have not spent long in North Carolina, but even from what little time I have spent there I could tell that it would be a great place to live, and doubly so in a house like this.</p>

<p>Back in December of last year, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5967622/the-tiny-transforming-apartment-that-packs-six-rooms-into-350-square-feet">Gizmodo linked to a sweet transforming apartment in New York</a>; Uncrate just picked the link up <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/transforming-micro-apartment/">last week</a>, and it&#8217;s just as awesome now as it was back then.</p>

<p>Cool cabins aren&#8217;t just an American phenomenon, nor something restricted to Europe and its surrounding countries. This quaint <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80357875000/elevated-farmers-cabin-on-the-island-of-flores">farmer&#8217;s cabin in Indonesia</a> proves it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I would call <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80464622315/rangiwahia-hut-at-1300-metres-in-the-ruahine">this one</a> a hut, but I won&#8217;t dispute its elevation of 1300 meters. If only those clouds weren&#8217;t there, I have no doubt that would be an incredible view.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80574402457/tilly-jane-cabin-in-the-mt-hood-national">this cabin in the Mt. Hood National Park in Oregon</a>. I have always wanted to travel to Oregon, and to know that I could spend a week in a cabin like this... Count me in.</p>

<p>Follow-up from my Cabin Porn Roundup post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-114.html">two months ago in January</a>, where I originally linked to this stone cabin in Linesco, Switzerland, Huckberry takes a more in-depth look at it in their article <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/shelter-hidden-cabin"><em>Shelter: Hidden Cabin</em></a>. I still can&#8217;t say that I love thee cold, modern, and impersonal interior, but it&#8217;s still pretty cool.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80676271401/rick-lee-has-been-building-a-small-off-grid-cabin">Cabin Porn&#8217;s link</a>, &#8220;Rick Lee has been building a small off-grid cabin in Arkansas with his young sons, using only materials they can carry in by hand.&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty awesome. Also, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesrleejr/sets/72157628691595507/">Rick&#8217;s Flickr page</a> where you can see tons of pictures taken throughout the process. Neat.</p>

<p>I would happily spend some time in <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80775453179/small-cabin-near-temenos-massachusetts">this small cabin in Massachusetts</a>. Looks like the perfect getaway to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;disconnected from the outside world, and just far enough removed from everything else to really get away from it all.</p>

<p>These <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/wheelhaus-mobile-cabins/">Wheelhaus Mobile Cabins</a> are incredible. I have always wanted a mobile home or camper that I could attach to the back of a large truck and just <em>go</em>, and these just sweeten the deal. Awesome.</p>

<p>How&#8217;s <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80847672649/charles-inglis-clark-memorial-hut-ben-nevis">this</a> for a bit of perspective?</p>

<p>Now <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/80876956857/huts-by-patrick-bouchain-and-alexandre-gauthier">these huts near Montreuil, France</a>, are just cool, and I love the idea of covering the outside with grasses. These look sort of like something I would have built over a weekend camping trip; I&#8217;d bet they&#8217;re a bit more accommodating than anything I could throw together though.</p>

<p>Man has it been a good month.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-03-31 08:40:03-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-03.html">03</a>/31 08:40:03 EST</time>
<p>In episode fifty-eight of the Accidental Tech Podcast, Marco, John, and Casey did some follow-up on their previous episode in which they discussed&#160;&#8212;&#160;among other topics&#160;&#8212;&#160;sexism. In response to the previous week&#8217;s show, <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/57-smorgasbord-of-pronunciation">ATP 57: <em>Smorgasbord Of Pronunciation</em></a>, I wrote the gruesomely-titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hedge-yourself.html"><em>Hedge Yourself Before They Wreck Yourself</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;a poorly-executed play on the &#8220;check yourself before you wreck yourself&#8221; clich&#233;&#160;&#8212;&#160;wherein I talked about my dislike of the culture surrounding social causes. Although I tried to publish that piece before the trio recorded ATP fifty-eight, I missed it by a day and posted my article late. After finally putting it out for all to see though, I went and listened to episode <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/58-always-on-vacation-in-california">58: <em>Always on Vacation in California</em></a>. To my surprise, within the first few minutes Marco validated everything I had opined against in my unfortunately-titled piece. For the unindoctrinated, here&#8217;s a transcript of the pertinent parts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[11:09]: Marco Arment: &#8220;The feedback was overall very positive, that people were very happy that we talked about the problems of sexism in tech. ... I was very scared&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I said during the show last week&#160;&#8212;&#160;I was very scared to talk about it because it&#8217;s so hard to talk about sexism without offending somebody on the side that you&#8217;re fighting for.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Casey Liss: &#8220;Yeah, and that&#8217;s why I pumped the brakes real hard in the beginning. And I&#8217;m really really glad and thankful that&#160;&#8212;&#160;I think it was mostly John basically that said, &#8221;Tough noogies, we&#8217;re going to talk about.&#8220; And I&#8217;m glad that we did, but oh man I was so scared... I was so scared in the beginning.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>John Siracusa: &#8220;I think Marco said&#160;&#8212;&#160;did you tweet that you had been afraid to touch on this topic but were pleasantly surprised that the backlash was not that bad, and that basically you had been too afraid of this topic for too long? And if you had known that it wasn&#8217;t, you know, the minefield that you thought it was going to be, you wouldn&#8217;t have been as hesitant?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Marco: &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly right. I try to fight for social causes that I care about, and this is one of those, but I&#8217;ve been really scared off by the public discourse around sexism because it just seems that everyone is being attacked, even people who are trying to make progress in eliminating or reducing sexism. They get attacked for something they didn&#8217;t include, or accidentally omitted, or didn&#8217;t say the right way&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s seems like it&#8217;s so cutthroat, the discussions out there that I see so often in print and on Twitter and stuff; no one&#8217;s given any leeway, no one&#8217;s given any slack, everyone assumes the worst of everyone else in the discussion. And frankly, that&#8217;s why I try to stay out of it: I&#8217;m so afraid of something blowing up in my face when I was just trying to help, but I did it in not quite the right way, or forgot about some condition, or something that I&#8217;m not thinking about, or some side effect of a word I&#8217;m thinking about&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s so hard to talk about it in a way that won&#8217;t get you attacked as well, from your side. It&#8217;s one thing if you say, &#8221;Sexism is a problem&#8220;, and then you&#8217;ve got a bunch of idiot men saying, &#8221;No, it&#8217;s not&#8220;&#160;&#8212;&#160;that&#8217;s one thing; I don&#8217;t care about that kind of attack, obviously. But if I&#8217;m trying to argue <em>for</em> the progress of this issue and for less sexism, and then I get attacked by anti-sexism advocates because I didn&#8217;t do it correctly&#160;&#8212;&#160;that discourages me from participating in the discussion at all. It&#8217;s very intimidating to even enter it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo&#160;&#8212;&#160;hit the nail on the head right there; this is exactly what I was railing against in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hedge-yourself.html"><em>Hedge Yourself Before They Wreck Yourself</em></a>. More so than a narrow-minded worldview by which pig-headed men ignore the reality of sexism, the more likely culprit preventing widespread discussion of this sensitive subject is those who champion it. Marco fell victim to the threat of their misguided backlash, as did Casey, and I as well, and I would bet anything that we&#8217;re not alone.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-03-31 08:25:50-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-03.html">03</a>/31 08:25:50 EST</time>
<p>Given my first link, I feel the need to state this explicitly <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-31614.html">just once more</a>: although I call this series &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221;, it may be helpful to think of it as a curated list of the best podcasts I listened to within the last week rather than a similar list consisting of only those <em>released</em> within the last seven days. After I published the first, I expanded my scope in this way so that I could include episodes from since-retired shows, or early episodes from now well-established podcasts. In doing so, I sought to truly provide you with a collection of the best shows possible, rather than a certain subset of those. Now, with that out of the way, let&#8217;s delve in to another week&#8217;s worth of excellent shows.</p>

<p><a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/digital-versus-analog/">The Weekly Briefly: Digital Versus Analog</a>. In last week&#8217;s public-facing installment of Shawn Blanc&#8217;s members-only podcast Shawn Today, <a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/">The Weekly Briefly</a>, Shawn talked about the value of old-school tools and methodologies over those new-fangled gadgets that all the kids use today. Granted, he did so slightly less curmudgeonly than I managed to in my brief recount, but don&#8217;t hold it against him: I really enjoyed the episode, and if you, like many others, liked his article <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/dumb/"><em>Dumb</em></a>, you&#8217;ll love this audio continuation of that post.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/40">The Prompt Episode #40: The World&#8217;s Greatest City</a>. This week on The Prompt, Myke and Federico discuss wearables&#160;&#8212;&#160;and specifically, smart watches&#160;&#8212;&#160;from opposite ends of the spectrum: one for it, while the other much more skeptical of the value proposition this class of device could provide. This discussion evolved into a broader one focused on the core competencies of the two main companies most look to for innovation in this area, Apple and Google, before the trio moved on to talk about Checkmark, <a href="https://twitter.com/chuckiej/status/446803392711917568">metric to imperial unit conversion</a>, and some iOS 8 rumors.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/88">CMD+SPACE Episode #88: Great Songs Everyday, with Jonathan Mann</a>. At 1,907 songs over as many consecutive days, Jonathan Mann is no slouch when it comes to buckling down and creating every single day. In the eighty-eighth episode of Myke Hurley&#8217;s interview show, the two talk about the creative process, inspiration, and success. I enjoyed listening to Jonathan speak just as much as I do <a href="http://youtu.be/pOyDW_Y2Emo">his</a> <a href="http://youtu.be/iCXItGrjqrw">songs</a>; come for the personality, then, but stay for the discussion that, by its end, will have you fired up to create for yourself once again.</p>

<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/57-smorgasbord-of-pronunciation">Accidental Tech Podcast 57: Smorgasbord of Pronunciation</a>. This week, the guys over at ATP take a break from software methodologies to discuss Yukari Kane&#8217;s book and the controversy surrounding it, which evolved into a discussion of journalism writ large and, later, Time Magazine&#8217;s recent interview with Jony Ive. Personally, I enjoyed that interview; however, John, Marco, and Casey tore it apart, for good reason, and in light of their criticisms I can now see where it fell short. Still, if you didn&#8217;t read it, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/jonathan-ive-talks-about-steve-jobs.html">I encourage you to do so</a>. After railing on the rough state of journalism today, they moved on to discuss virtual reality and the challenges facing this seemingly perpetually out-of-reach technology, and then sexism. All in all, A very thought-provoking episode on many fronts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/76/">The Talk Show Episode 76: Here&#8217;s a Frickin&#8217; Pipe Dream</a>. Craig Hockenberry joined John Gruber to first talk about blood oranges, and then wearables and how that broader category may not only include the traditional watch, but many other interesting implementations as well. This conversation turned into a discussion of the value proposition of a wearable device, and rounded out to become one of the best conversations on this subject I have heard to date.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-103-artisanal-pork-bakery.html">Roderick on the Line Ep. 103: &#8220;Artisanal Pork Bakery&#8221;</a>. I could list the topics Merlin and John discussed during this episode, but instead let me say this: this show epitomizes exactly what makes Roderick on the Line just <em>so</em> great, and exemplifies the reasons so many have come to love the pair&#8217;s weekly chats. Wow.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/89">Systematic #89: Colin Devroe on developing in the open</a>. In the first live recording of Systematic in the show&#8217;s history, Brett Terpstra has Colin Devroe on to talk about building sustainable businesses and the perils facing fledgling companies in their early days. If you have ever considered going the way of the startup, this episode would be a great place to get the ball rolling. The pair also talked about painting and spending more time outside after thirty years indoors, so if the talk of business strategy for some reason holds no interest for you, there&#8217;s still something worth tuning in to hear.</p>

<p><a href="http://commonplacebooks.com">Night Vale</a>. I chose not to link to a particular episode of Night Vale because I wish to point out not a single installment of this peculiar show, but rather it as the modern-day audio phenomenon equivalent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone">The Twilight Zone</a> in the 1960s. It&#8217;s strange, thought-provoking, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;at times&#160;&#8212;&#160;just plausible enough to be real. One thing remains constant, though: I enjoy listening to every single episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/114">The Critical Path Episode #114: Veronica&#8217;s Dilemma</a>. After a short hiatus, Horace and Mois&#0233;s kicked off a new chapter in the history of The Critical Path with an interesting discussion on capitalism, industrialization, and the cyclical nature of disruptive entrants and sustainable business leading up to the introduction of their main topic for the foreseeable future: a new theory called The Capitalist&#8217;s Dilemma. I won&#8217;t attempt to explain this idea here, so just go check out the episode; Horace does an excellent job of explaining it with regards to today&#8217;s largest tech companies, Apple and Google.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/89">CMD+SPACE Episode #89: Opportunity Knocks, with Casey Liss</a>. For this episode of Myke Hurley&#8217;s popular interview show, Casey Liss of The Accidental Tech Podcast joined him to talk about their respective journeys to becoming internet famous, and how upon reaching that point&#160;&#8212;&#160;contrary to what some may believe&#160;&#8212;&#160;the struggle to create great, noteworthy work only becomes harder. As an aspiring blogger myself, I found their advice and encouragement immeasurably inspirational.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/prompt/41">The Prompt Episode #41: Progress, Not A Revolution</a>. In Stephen Hacket&#8217;s absence, Myke Hurley and Federico Viticci talk about Apple, iTunes, and the company&#8217;s future in the music space. Then, they moved on to virtual reality both in the gaming industry and outside of it, which encompassed a discussion of Facebook&#8217;s possible plans for this recently-acquired technology. A very informative episode, to be sure.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-26-evan-doll-apple-and-flipboard">Debug 26: Evan Doll on Apple and Flipboard</a>, <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-27-joe-hewitt-facebook-and-gardening">Debug 27: Joe Hewitt on Facebook and gardening</a>, and <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-28-mike-ash-voodoopad">Debug 28: Mike Ash on VoodooPad</a>. There is no single aspect or topic of these three shows that I would point out as particularly noteworthy, but I enjoyed each of these interviews as great examples of this format done well.</p>

<p>Yes. Earlier this week, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ben-thompson-on-the-future-of-news-and-newspapers.html">I posted a link</a> to Ben Thompson&#8217;s three-part series on the future of newspapers and journalism. Riffing off of that theme, Josh Ginter shares some thoughts along those lines. He&#8217;s very hopeful about the future of the blogging industry, and rightly so.</p>

<p>I really, really like this. To put it in the context of writing, how about taking your best day&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether you measure that by number of articles posted or page views gained&#160;&#8212;&#160;and make that your goal <em>every single day?</em> It would be hard, and many would say impractical, but maintaining the same waistline for fifteen years is hard too. In both cases, though, they are worthwhile pursuits.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-03-28 17:47:44-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-03.html">03</a>/28 17:47:44 EST</time>
<p>Whereas Clay Shirky spoke to the benefits of online education, Mark Edmundson is a bit more skeptical in his 2012 (yet still just as relevant)<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> article for The New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/opinion/the-trouble-with-online-education.html"><em>The Trouble With Online Education</em></a>. I agree with most of the criticisms Clay made in his two articles <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/your-massively-open-offline-college-is-broken.html">I linked to yesterday</a>, particularly with regards to the unsustainability of the current model upon which higher education runs. However, having spent three of my high school years taking online courses from various remote schools, and now that&#160;&#8212;&#160;for the first time in my life&#160;&#8212;&#160;I actually go to a classroom on a regular basis, I feel confident in saying that there exists no absolute solution to this problem.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that tuition continues to rise, students find it increasingly difficult to afford four years or more in college, and the degree received upon graduation continues to lose its value in the workplace. Clay&#8217;s proposed solution, the widespread adoption of massive open online course or some improved upon derivative, would take a much-needed step in the right direction by mitigating the first and second challenges traditionally faced by higher education institutions. Further, by decreasing the cost of getting a degree, a decline in value of that sheet of paper would become less of a problem. The key word there, though, is &#8220;mitigate&#8221;: his approach&#160;&#8212;&#160;for I cannot, in good conscience, erroneously characterize it as a solution&#160;&#8212;&#160;really ought not be heralded as a the answer at all, but simply a temporary stopgap to the larger problem at hand.</p>

<p>Setting the practicality of Clay&#8217;s proposal aside and placing value upon it solely in accordance with his faith in it though, it would be foolish to discount the benefits of a brick and mortar school where students foster lifelong relationships, and encourage each other&#160;&#8212;&#160;rarely consciously, although often subconsciously&#160;&#8212;&#160;to excel. Although other benefits to this approach exist, as well as numerous disadvantages, these two stand out as the most advantageous. After spending the past three years learning online, I can tell you with certainty that remote institutions offer neither of those boons, and in fact, based on my experience, are more likely to be a net loss than anything else: a bare minimum of interaction between students and faculty encourages the completion of the minimum amount of work for the best possible grade. While I have enough friends in America&#8217;s public schools to know that this is by no means unique to remote classes, and know enough kids who loved their online classes to realize that I do not typify the norm there either, the point stands: education does not generalize. The question we ought to be asking, then, is not whether web-based education is the future by which all colleges will advance and become profitable institutions, or whether the current system is merely the last vestige of a bygone era, but rather how we can improve both to promote the best learning experience for the next generation.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;I could, and perhaps will, devote an entire article to the fact that after two years, his thoughts on this form of education remain relevant. Especially in this industry where fortunes are made seemingly overnight, it stands to reason that we would have seen more progress than this by now. The fact that we have not would make for an interesting point of discussion indeed.</p>

<p>I have written about this before, in an article titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/testing-the-apple-tax.html"><em>Testing the Apple Tax</em></a>, and Ben Lovejoy comes to the same conclusion I did in his piece over at 9to5 Mac: in reality, the proposed &#8220;Apple tax&#8221; is, frankly, nearly nonexistent. Taking into account overall build quality, form factor, fit and finish, power, and power consumption, Mac computers compete quite competitively with their PC &#8220;counterparts&#8221;; adding in other factors such as resale value, maintenance, and support, I have a hard time believing anyone could make the reasonable case than any manufacturer offers greater value than Apple. The only part of Ben&#8217;s article that I took issue with was his belief that a five-year-old Windows machine would have any resale value whatsoever: late last year I tried to attain some return on investment for four DELL laptops roughly that old, and as far as anyone was concerned, they were worthless.</p>

<p>Education is a topic near and dear to my heart, so whenever I can find an interesting, well-written article on the subject I tend to afford it slightly more attention than I might Business Insider&#8217;s terrible article explaining possible reasons behind Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Oculus. Unfortunately, these articles often turn out mediocre at best; this piece by Clay Shirky, however, and its predecessor <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/"><em>Napster, Udacity, and the Academy</em></a>, are both very interesting in-depth looks at the problems facing higher education in America. You will have to spend a while reading both of these, but it will be time well spent.</p>

<p>Although I have touched on facets of this topic before&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-feminist-who-cried-wolf.html">in articles I encourage you to read before continuing</a> partly <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/in-defence-of-entangled-bank.html">to have a bit of background to frame my subsequent words with</a>, partly because I still feel quite proud of how well they turned out, but mostly because I still stand behind those sentiments&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have put off writing this for quite some time, for a whole host of reasons. After listening to <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/57-smorgasbord-of-pronunciation">last week&#8217;s episode of the Accidental Tech Podcast</a>, however, where John, Marco, and Casey discussed sexism and the best ways in which to respond to accusations of unsavory bias towards the &#8220;wrong&#8221; side of politically-charged topics, I decided it was high-time I put my two-cents out there for everyone to tear apart as they see fit. Throughout the rest of that day, I spent every spare moment tapping nearly eight hundred words into a first draft; after a bit of editing and some minor corrections, this is the end result.</p>

<p>The thing I take issue with in regards to many of today&#8217;s social movements is that these marginalized groups have made their problems universal to the entire population. Whether the (often self-selecting) crowd is advocating for gender equality, recognition of the legitimacy of their sexuality, or prayer in schools, they speak out often and with enough volume to permeate the collective discourse to such an extent that it no longer becomes acceptable to refer to a member of the female gender as a &#8220;girl&#8221; due to some perceived connotations that word carries over &#8220;woman&#8221;, for example, when in reality I merely needed a word to say she was a female and ought not use the bathroom on the left. These self-proclaimed activists speak so vociferously that I have to carefully monitor every gesture I make as a heterosexual male so as not to unintentionally signal any dislike or otherwise condemnatory sentiment towards someone of another sexual orientation. Because of these battle lines, I no longer have the option of remaining neutral or ambivalent; I have to come down as either strictly and wholeheartedly for a particular mantra, or perish in the face of it. My own opinions on these topics are wholly irrelevant, and are completely outside of the scope of this piece; my annoyance is universal, and applies to every hot-button issue on the seemingly rotating docket of inflammatory subjects news outlets, among others, select topics from. The way I respond to these groups and the causes they advocate for, however, does not come down to a question of personal belief, but that of basic decency.</p>

<p>I absolutely do not condone gender discrimination&#160;&#8212;&#160;some of the best technically-minded individuals I have ever met were females, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-crying-shame.html">in fact</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;nor do I support discrimination based upon who you decide to marry, nor the abolition or promotion of prayer by fiat. At the risk of sounding repetitive, I feel the need to make this important point one more time: these three reactions are not necessarily resultant of my own opinions towards these movements, but rather stem from a desire to behave decently and humanely towards the appropriate individuals. As has been said by many in the past, I don&#8217;t hold the door open for you because you are a lady; I hold it open for you because that&#8217;s who I am, and it has nothing to do with you whatsoever. Back to the topic at hand though, my problem with these movements, then, is that those of us who have never done anything but try to teach girls everything we know with the same fervor that we teach their brothers, and have never called anyone a queer, and have never either encouraged or discouraged someone from praying in school, have to carefully monitor and hedge every single thing we say. The best of us, the non-discriminatory, have to phrase everything we write and utter with the perfect combination of nouns and verbs while giving equal attention to every interest group involved for fear of one of their armchair activists jumping down our throats after a misplaced comma in an old book turns &#8220;And on that day I felt gay, boy&#8221; to &#8220;And on that day I felt gay boy&#8221; and ignites a week of controversy that mires everyone involved in nuanced arguments before dissipating as fast as it erupted, to leave nothing changed but the victim of their backlash scared and afraid to ever say anything publicly again.</p>

<p>Not to throw gun control into the mix, but its inclusion will lend credence to my ultimate point. Criminals will not get rid of their guns if possessing them becomes illegal. I guarantee that I could walk a mile in any direction from my college campus in Youngstown, Ohio, and find enough firepower to occupy Wall Street for real. Upstanding citizens will get rid of their guns, though, because that&#8217;s the &#8220;right&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use scare quotes here because the definition of the morally good course of action will vary from legislator to legislator depending on their particular values&#160;&#8212;&#160;thing to do, meanwhile I will only have to walk a mile and a half in any direction off of my campus to find the same number, quality, and power of firearms as before. This restriction would not&#160;&#8212;&#160;does not&#160;&#8212;&#160;penalize the right people, and the same thing could be said for forcing all the upstanding internet denizens to tread on egg shells whenever putting forth anything for public consumption: the people that will care, the ones who will take the time to respond to you, apologize, and rewrite their blog post, are not the problem. At the end you will have only served to affect the right change in the wrong part of the non-problem. The ones we need to crack down on in order to affect any meaningful change are those who will merely shell out a small surcharge to purchase their weapons after a hypothetical law outlaws them, not the ones who will willingly cease purchasing them or hand them over altogether; I&#8217;ll leave the corollary to the broader topic at hand for you to form yourself.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a long article, because I feel no need to rant, and I have no desire to wax on endlessly. I don&#8217;t necessarily disagree with these causes, just their methods. As is the case in most areas of my life, I was tempted to brush this dissatisfaction aside with the age-old adage proclaiming that the ends&#160;&#8212;&#160;in this case, equality and moral reparation across the board&#160;&#8212;&#160;justify the means. But in the end, crucifying a thousand innocents without addressing the real problem solely for the sake of feeling as if something has been done is no solution at all. In fact, I <em>might</em> even go so far as to say that this haphazard approach is worse than the problems it attempts to rectify in the first place.</p>

<p>And there I go hedging again.</p>

<p>Now this makes sense: Mark Zuckerberg may not necessarily believe virtual reality is the future of computing, and thus a good reason to purchase Oculus, but with the scale Facebook is operating on it would be foolish to take any risks. For a company of Facebook&#8217;s size, with so much to lose should they make the wrong bet, two billion dollars really is nothing.</p>

<p>Interesting take on why Facebook elected to buy Oculus by Joe Rosenstee of <a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/">Unauthoritative Pronouncements</a>. I haven&#8217;t fully worked out the justification for this purchase in my own mind, but I will comment on something tangentially related to this deal: as Joe pointed out in his article, and <a href="https://twitter.com/LinusEdwards/status/448814418890350593">Linus Edwards as well on Twitter earlier</a>, for some reason many seem to have this mistaken notion that Oculus&#160;&#8212;&#160;or Facebook&#160;&#8212;&#160;owes its Kickstarter backers something. Talk about entitlement issues, and an impressive ability to misunderstand the exchange Kickstarter facilitates. As backers, you provide the startup money&#160;&#8212;&#160;that initial push to make it to market. In return, you receive whatever rewards the project owner elects to distribute based on your contribution. That exchange is the extent of your relationship with the company.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-03-26 10:58:56-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-03.html">03</a>/26 10:58:56 EST</time>
<p>It seems more and more these days, and especially over the last week or two in particular&#160;&#8212;&#160;perhaps in conjunction with the rise of the smartwatch as a general topic of discussion&#160;&#8212;&#160;people have begun yearning for the lifestyle of yesteryear when <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/dumb/">watches fulfilled the single, uncomplicated need of telling time</a>, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/staying-home-connected-to-the-world/">running errands entailed a trip to the local grocery store</a>, and <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/turns-out-you-never-have-to-leave-your-front-door">sometimes you just had to shovel through four feet of snow to get to the driveway</a>. Although I can&#8217;t say that I look forward to every one of those tasks every single day, there is something to be said for a lifestyle less reliant on technology.</p>

<p>The problem I see in every single article discussion the perceived value proposition of a smartwatch is the limited scope with which we have to think about such a hypothetical product. With very few exceptions, everyone assumes such a device will operate almost solely based on audio input, and serve up minor notifications while fulfilling computing tasks of arguable import; most of the work, as the generally-accepted theory goes, will remain solely for the smartphone. In assessing this belief, it is useful to pause and examine the evolution of the supposed smartwatch&#8217;s companion device, the smartphone, pre- and post-iPhone revolution:</p>

<p>At the dawn of the smartphone, back before the term had entered the common vernacular, phones made voice calls. Even taking into account the devices that had the fringe benefit of serving as a relay for short text messages if you happened to be in your teens or early twenties, these served but two purposes. Today, just a short seven years later, these formerly nondescript accessories have evolved into the one-stop shop for every computational need. In fact, some have even gone so far as to completely replace their owner&#8217;s need for any other computer; thankfully, Apple started offering in-store device setup in response. Ten years ago&#160;&#8212;&#160;nay, even eight&#160;&#8212;&#160;no one could have predicted that less than a decade would pass before pocketable phones had more power than the day&#8217;s supercomputers. Point is, though, that even at the brink of the smartphone revolution, no one could have foreseen the remarkable innovations ahead, and how that increase in computational capability would radically alter the face of this category. It would be foolish to ignore that corollary here when evaluating the notion of a smartwatch.</p>

<p>Now, that said, although I remain hopeful that a wrist-worn device will rock our collective world, I happen to fall more in line with Shawn&#8217;s opinion that even in an age of connected watches, there remains a place for bespoke mechanical wristwatches that do nothing more than tell the time. From a past article of mine titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/earning-it.html"><em>Earning It</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I have prematurely reached a point in my life where I no longer want to settle for anything: I want to eat good food, watch good movies, listen to good music, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;most of all&#160;&#8212;&#160;I want great gear. Whereas it takes most people a lifetime to reach this point, I have somehow managed to get here after just nineteen short years. With regards to technology, that means an iPhone as the always-on computer in my pocket, a MacBook Pro in my backpack, and an iPad to replace the gargantuan Calculus textbook I would otherwise have had to carry around.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The broader sentiment I expressed in that piece applies here as well: although I hesitate to so publicly proclaim this without seeing what the competition has to offer, five years down the road I see myself wearing the very attractive Seiko watch Shawn Blanc pointed out in his article <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/dumb/"><em>Dumb</em></a> rather than something much more technically advanced; the former appeals to me in ways the latter could never. And although that is an admittedly two-way street, my previous tendencies and inclinations lead me to believe that I will opt for Old Faithful rather than a more modern contraption.</p>

<p>If other recent articles are to be believed, Shawn Blanc and I are not the only ones with a soft spot for technology and methodologies brought into existence by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html">&#8220;the old guard&#8221;</a>: Nick Bilton wrote an article for The New York Times titled <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/staying-home-connected-to-the-world/"><em>Staying Home, Connected to the World</em></a> where he painted a picture of a possible future in which current trends in technology and today&#8217;s youth progressed to a point where leaving one&#8217;s home ceased to be necessary for anything. Josh Ginter added his own two-cents in a similar post, <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/turns-out-you-never-have-to-leave-your-front-door"><em>Turns Out You Never Have to Leave Your Front Door</em></a>, which sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place.</p>

<p>Many recognize an impending future even more reliant on technology, but it seems that as it continues its incessant march onwards, getting closer and closer with each breakthrough, more people are becoming less excited about it. At what point does it all become too much? I have hesitantly drawn a line in the sand at watches doing more than providing me easy access to the time; for others, this line will come at different places on the same continuum. That location will ultimately inform the capabilities of every single piece of future technology though, from smartwatch to <a href="http://furbo.org/2014/03/13/wearing-apple/">smart ring</a> even more than the engineering and manufacturing capability of the companies that manufacture these devices. At some point, it will all become too much.</p>

<p>Thanks to Dave Pell&#8217;s The Next Draft <a href="http://nextdraft.com/archives/n20140320/these-kids-today/">for the original link</a>, I found this article from The Atlantic a few days ago, and it&#8217;s great&#160;&#8212;&#160;really great, actually; I would even go so far as to call it exceptional. For this piece, Hanna Rosin traveled to the United Kingdom to get some first-hand experience with a novel playground concept called The Land, where rather than the sanitized, boring playsets so common especially in America, kids get to actually challenge themselves with activities I would still enjoy at nineteen years old. Using the growing popularity of this concept as a jumping-off point, she discusses an unfortunate trend of the last few decades whereby children have increasingly fewer opportunities to play and grow without the heavy-handed supervision of their parents acting as an omnipresent deterrent of anything remotely challenging or risky. Fortunately, I often had the opportunity and permission to go off on my own so long as I remained safe; unfortunately, that seems less and less the case nowadays. All in all, a fascinating article and well-worth the read if you have any interest in even tangentially-related facets of this broad subject. Seriously, I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p>

<p>FireChat is a new iOS app that purportedly allows its users to send text messages and pictures between devices without the use of both a cellular and wifi connection, at ranges up to thirty feet, using a new iOS 7 networking feature. Although these days I would rarely have any reason to use such an app, I would have loved to have this ability on an airplane, for instance, or out of the country where carriers can charge exorbitant rates. Regardless of whether I actually need it though, I can&#8217;t wait to try this out.</p>

<p>Earlier, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-passion-trap.html">I linked to</a> an article <a href="http://thetypist.com/425/trap-passion/">from The Typist</a> where he expressed dissatisfaction with the majority of &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; articles, and then went on to recommend some truly great advice with regards to that trite mantra from <a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2014/03/the-passion-trap.html">Bradley Voytek</a>: &#8220;don&#8217;t follow your passions, follow your competencies, and you might just find you enjoy doing something you&#8217;re good at.&#8221; When linking to The Typist and, by extension, Bradley&#8217;s articles, I conveyed a similar level of disapproval for this genre of writing. Turns out, the three of us are not alone: Kevin Drum, writing for Mother Jones, is just about fed up with wealthy individuals pontificating to those less fortunate than them, advising them to pursue unsustainable lifestyles just to chase a dream at the expense of every other aspect of their lives; I absolutely agree with him: I would much rather spend a summer hiking the Appalachian Trail, but I have to work so that during the school year, I have money for gas and car insurance and food and the iPhone I love so dearly; I would much rather spend a day writing than going to class, but there, too, I have no choice in the matter. It&#8217;s easy to romanticize the past and talk about how you would have done it given the chance to do it all over again, but you you didn&#8217;t do it that way the first time around, and you have no idea how your life would have turned out if you had. Aspirations are fine, but not at the expense of your well-being.</p>

<p>Like The Typist, I rarely read articles on passion&#160;&#8212;&#160;the ones that prescribe that everyone follow their dreams to the detriment of every other aspect of their lives; not only are such pieces irresponsible, but impractical as well. Bradley Voytek&#8217;s article, however, which The Typist links to and relegates to such a category, really ought to belong to a category all its own&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s just that good, and features neither of the disadvantageous aspects many other articles of this genre do. A great read, and something young people in particular ought to read. Going through many of the things Bradley describes myself, his article hit home especially hard for me.</p>

<p>When I published <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-3214.html">this article&#8217;s predecessor</a>, I should have debuted this series as a collection of the podcasts I listened to within the past week rather than those released during that time period. This slight difference in phrase would have been especially appropriate given my eight-day absence last week, during which I could not listen to a single episode of any show. Now that I have returned, with a week&#8217;s worth of episodes now outside of my stated time frame, I have painted myself into a corner of sorts. Or I would have, but for the fact that I can make that necessary change now: from here on out, these &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221; posts will include episodes I have listened to since publishing the last installment rather than only those less than a week old. In addition to broadening the scope of these posts, this will also give me the ability to&#160;&#8212;&#160;in good conscience&#160;&#8212;&#160;talk about retired shows and episodes long past their prime. On top of that, I can now talk about all the shows I missed while in the Bahamas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esn.fm/thank-you-for-calling/3-willing-to-negotiate">Thank You For Calling! 3: Willing to Negotiate</a>. Part two of a nearly hour-long show recorded with John Roderick, Jim Dalrymple, Lex Friedman, and Brent Billings back in February, Mois&#0233;s and his impressive roster of guests continue discussing airline travel and all its associated frustrations and miseries. Come for the guests, stay for the topic: each not only brings with them their unique personality, but their own just barely believable horror story as well. If Mois&#0233;s manages to maintain this level of quality in all his shows across the recently-established <a href="http://www.esn.fm">Electric Shadow Network</a>, I&#8217;m going to have to carve a lot more time out of my schedule for podcasts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esn.fm/electric-shadow/3-libido-of-a-salesman">Electric Shadow 3: Libido of a Salesman</a>. Speaking of Mois&#0233;s, his new network, rock star rosters, and great podcasts, Adam Lisagor, John Gruber, and Guy English got together to talk about new media and how original content producers like Netflix could shake up the status quo within this industry. Also, Bad Grandpa.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esn.fm/electric-shadow/4-meatball-on-the-tree">Electric Shadow 4: Meatball on the Tree</a>. In the second part of their two-part series, Mois&#0233;s, John,  Adam, and Guy continued their discussion by delving in to the then-recent news of Comcast attempting to overtake Time Warner and become one of the world&#8217;s largest cable providers, and the associated topic of net neutrality, before going off the rails and moving on to talk about Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s performance on the Tonight Show. The last hour or so were a bit erratic but the first half more than made up for it.</p>

Hat-tip to Marco for <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/11/merlin-storming-mortal">pointing this one out</a>, An&#382;e Tomic &#8220;interviewed&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use that term lightly here, because it really felt nothing like the stale, scripted interviews I see all too often these days&#160;&#8212;&#160;Merlin Mann for his show <em>Storming Mortal</em>. If An&#382;e&#8217;s name sounds familiar, you may be recognizing it from <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/2/3/the-podcasters-3">Linus Edwards&#8217;s The Podcasters series</a>, or the thirty-seventh episode of The Menu Bar, <a href="http://themenubar.net/podcastfeed/tmb-ep037"><em>iKlout</em></a>, where Andrew Clark and Zac Cichy had him on as a guest. An&#382;e is a great guest, but an even better host; this is one show you shouldn&#8217;t miss.</p>

<p><a href="http://thevoicemail.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/episode-088/">The Voicemail 088</a>. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-3214.html">Again</a>, absolutely hilarious: if you enjoyed Stefan and James in their previous episode wherein they talked about Mobile World Congress&#160;&#8212;&#160;and honestly, I can&#8217;t for the life of my find a reason you wouldn&#8217;t have&#160;&#8212;&#160;you&#8217;ll love this successor episode. The Voicemail is quickly becoming one of my favorite shows by far, and great episodes like this one are certainly not helping everyone else&#8217;s shows.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/bionic/82">Bionic #82: Do as Mel Gibson Does</a>. I&#8217;m trying not to link every single episode of Bionic in these articles, but Myke Hurley and Matt Alexander are just <em>that</em> good at what they do here. If you ever wondered what it was like to be an entrepreneur with your own mens&#8217; clothing startup, <em>Do as Mel Gibson Does</em> is a great place to find that out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/74/">The Talk Show 74: Heart of a Gambler</a>. Glenn Fleishman joined John Gruber to talk about Bitcoin in perhaps the best discussion on the topic I have heard to date; highly recommended if you have any interest in the world of cryptocurrencies, and especially if you ever intend to participate.</p>

<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/56-the-woodpecker">ATP 56: The Woodpecker</a>. After <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/55-dave-who-stinks">their previous episode on software methodologies</a>, in which John (apparently erroneously, if the show&#8217;s listeners are to be believed) placed programming above all other fields with regards to difficulty, he came back with some fantastic follow-up reminiscent of Hypercritical where he clarified his statement and made a rather damning case for it. This is John at his best, folks. Unfortunately, it only lasted about twenty-six minutes&#160;&#8212;&#160;a far cry from the days of Hypercritical&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I&#8217;ll take what I can get. After that, they went on to work through some more software methodology follow-up, Marco&#8217;s new Mac Pro, and then talk about AV receivers and sound systems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, although I had an entire week to do so, I failed to catch up on all the podcasts I missed while out of the country: as of this morning, my queue still contains fifteen episodes coming in at just over twelve hours. But this is the cross I have elected to bear, and so&#160;&#8212;&#160;with a heavy heart&#160;&#8212;&#160;I will go into next week with a roster of fantastic shows queued and ready to play. It&#8217;s a tough job, but someone has to do it.</p>

<p>A bit of a forgone conclusion at this point, but still worthwhile to have someone so skilled as Horace Dediu put the phone market into perspective, especially with regards to that upstart Apple. Come for the insight, but stay for his conclusion; that is, indeed, a mystery, and one that Apple has obviously solved.</p>

<p>Fantastic interview by John Arlidge of Time Magazine with Apple&#8217;s famed designer Jony Ive. I will do neither the disservice of taking a pull-quote from this piece, for you really should read it in its entirety rather than in pieces, but I will say this: the key takeaway, I felt, is the remarkable humanity of this entire process: from inception to creation to ultimate release, at no point in the life of these devices does anyone measure their viability, utility, or success by something so mundane as technical specifications. Rather, it all comes down to the human element&#160;&#8212;&#160;the experience, to use a rather clich&#233;d turn of phrase, for in the end, when all is said and done, what else is left but the device in your hand?</p>

<p>Besides the cursory test shortly after iTunes Radio launched, yesterday marked the first time I had used the service for any extended period of time. In my past experiences, the recommendations had proved mediocre at best, and the process not compelling enough to prompt me to switch away from the songs I already knew and loved. Yesterday, though, I gave it another shot; and I <em>loved</em> it.</p>

<p>In the past, I have used Pandora, Last.fm, Spotify, Rdio, and Beats Music. At various, rarely-overlapping points in time, I had all their apps on my phone. For one reason or another, though, I left each; often, it was because the ratio of songs I liked to those I never wanted to hear again never managed to climb high enough to make the service feel worthwhile. Pandora got the closest, but again, I found myself spending more time than I wanted to fine-tuning the recommendation engine across some twelve different stations. Then, on a whim, I created a new station yesterday, and found that&#160;&#8212;&#160;to my delight&#160;&#8212;&#160;that I did not need to tweak anything for iTunes Radio to play some really <em>great</em> songs for me. It was upon this high, of sorts, that I turned on iTunes Radio earlier this morning and sat down to write for a while before my next class. Less than ten minutes later though, I heard my first ad&#160;&#8212;&#160;an ad for McDonalds, of all places, featuring a local basketball star.</p>

<p>At first, I thought little of this intrusion: I had set my mind to other, more important tasks. A song or two later, though, it came on again: the same ad, for the same company, featuring the same celebrity endorsement. This time my attention piqued: iTunes Match subscribers, of which I was one, were not supposed to have ads of any sort&#160;&#8212;&#160;or so I seemed to remember, anyway. A trip over to the iTunes Radio page confirmed this belief, and created a great deal of confusion given that I had not only heard ads in my supposedly ad-free stream, but that I had heard them in such close proximity to one another as well. Thinking that perhaps my subscription had lapsed, I checked iTunes: iTunes Match was on and enabled. Maybe I did not have iTunes Match activated on my phone; turns out I did. Without any explanation for this happenstance, then, I sent a quick email to Apple support questioning why, even though I paid my dues as part of their iTunes Match user base, I had heard these ads. The response I got floored me. After instructing me to check as to whether I had iTunes Match activated or not, the customer service rep assigned to my case had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, only iTunes Match subscribers can listen to iTunes Radio ad-free, but even you may hear occasional artist or channel promotions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What?</em></p>

<p>Take a look at the exact wording on Apple&#8217;s iTunes Radio page. Beneath the &#8220;iTunes Radio is ad-free with iTunes Match&#8221; heading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Instead of hearing the occasional ad, you can listen to iTunes Radio completely ad-free when you subscribe to iTunes Match on your Mac, PC, or iOS device.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh. So although one of the advertised benefits of subscribing to iTunes Match, in addition to having the ability to store one&#8217;s entire music library in the cloud, is an ad-free steaming experience, in actuality that&#8217;s a rather disingenuous claim if my service rep was to be believed. And based on my experience, I would side with her over Apple&#8217;s marketing material. It&#8217;s unfortunate, this dichotomy between what we supposedly get in exchange for our money, and what we actually get. And from Apple, of all companies. How disappointing.</p>

<p>Shortly after returning from six months spent circling the globe, Jonny and Michelle set back out on the road and spent a year traveling across America. Again, I&#8217;m jealous: although I have lived in and traveled through quite a few states, my travels have thus far consisted of mostly the eastern seaboard, and nothing more westward than Wisconsin. Someday, I would love to take a similar journey.</p>

<p>Not to be redundant, but Jonny and Michelle dropped everything to spend six months traveling the world, and that really is incredible. I have already done a great deal of traveling in my life&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have lived in five states and visited more than I can remember, and spent a great deal of time abroad in seven countries spread across two continents&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I wholeheartedly agree with their comment that traveling does indeed beget more traveling: given the chance, I would love to go back and visit any of the places I have been to in the past, and that&#8217;s to say nothing for all the places I want to go in the future. I don&#8217;t understand the people who have never left their hometown, let alone the state they were born in. The world is a vast and incredibly diverse place; go out and see some of it.</p>

<p>Excellent news, and definitely a step in the right direction. I went through the opposite process a few weeks ago in creating my now-defunct newsletter, but thankfully realized the error of my ways shortly thereafter, discontinued it, and refocused my efforts on this site. Diversifying your public outlets in an attempt at creating multiple more focused properties seems like a good idea in theory, but invariably falls down in practice.</p>

<p>As I prepared to leave for my trip to The Bahamas last week, I saw an article from <a href="http://gizmodo.com/this-futuristic-truck-was-actually-designed-by-walmart-1535929971">Gizmodo</a> go by linking to <a href="http://blog.walmart.com/notes-from-the-milestone-meeting">a blog post from Walmart</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;of all companies&#160;&#8212;&#160;showcasing a new concept vehicle that would make a number of significant improvements to current semi designs. I read through the article, and then sat down to write a short post about it; however, I quickly realized that I had much more to say on this topic than could be contained within the single paragraph of a link post, so I jotted down a quick draft and then left the work of creating a finished article until I got back from a day on and off airplanes flying across the U.S.</p>

<p>More interesting than this futuristic design is the company it came from, and how that typifies trends in innovation of years nearly&#160;&#8212;&#160;but not quite since&#160;&#8212;&#160;past. Interesting, but not surprising: Walmart creating this new truck is a throwback to the &#8220;olden&#8221; days when huge corporations would prompt innovation solely based on their own goals and&#160;&#8212;&#160;by extension&#160;&#8212;&#160;needs, where the goal of decreasing costs led to the need of a more efficient transportation mechanism, and thus to the inception of a radical new semi truck design. When considered in light of this realization, Walmart as an unlikely source of innovation at first glance becomes not only a sensible source, but a likely one as well. Some years from now, assuming this project proves viable and advantageous as more than a PR gimmick, the concepts on display here first will flow to other areas of the market and eventually reach consumers, and thus become widespread. This is corporate-based innovation in a nutshell, and should be contrasted with the much more recent phenomenon of user-centric innovation whereby products come into being based upon what consumers desire.</p>

<p>Corporate products, and especially software solutions, are notoriously terrible for users: without the option of employing an alternative, employees have no choice but to use programs put forth by their company&#8217;s IT department regardless of how hostile an experience it may be. Thus, with no incentive to achieve excellence in any area but one or two core competencies, few spend the extra time and energy that creating pleasurable user experiences necessitates. Because this corporate technology ultimately trickled down to the consumer market, it led to an obvious deficiency in options fit for every day use where the only barrier to switching from one subpar product to another better one was a price tag. Fortunately, Steve Jobs entered the computing industry and in the late &#8216;90s and early 2000s capitalized on this deficiency, and thus the antithesis to the corporate-based model was born: user-centric innovation. Although I lean towards making the case that it took Apple until the iPhone to do this well and at scale, I don&#8217;t know enough about early Apple products to say that with any significant degree of certainty. Regardless of which product marked the fulfillment of their goal to create delightful products based on their users&#8217; needs though, at some point in their timeline Apple became the company that created products <em>for</em> consumers first rather than accepting widespread adoption as a secondary goal to the primary one of solving a single job in the cheapest way possible. Those days of company-centric innovation are fast fading and although not quite gone yet, as evidenced by Walmart&#8217;s move, won&#8217;t be around for much longer; the market has spoken, and they want consumer-first design. Anything else is to be eventually discarded.</p>

<p>Within the last week there has been a great deal of talk about sponsorships: <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/14/ending-sponsorships">Marco Arment ended sponsored blog posts</a>, citing waning interest and falling click-through rates. <a href="http://blog.samhutchings.co/2014/03/15/lets-talk-about-sponsorship/">Sam Hutchings chimed in on the debate regarding bias</a> and how it could, theoretically, adversely affect credibility. Josh Ginter, <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/marco-ending-sponsorships-has-lasting-implications">writing in response to Marco&#8217;s aforementioned post</a>, posited that Marco&#8217;s decision might not be an anomaly, but indicative of a disturbing trend in the blogging space. I don&#8217;t see this topic elevating any further from here, so I might as well chime in now.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about bias: Sam Hutchings is by no means the first to bring this topic up, nor did he pretend to be: his article is merely the continuation of a long-held gripe focused mainly on podcasters, criticizing them for some perceived bias regarding the products and companies that keep their lights on. I have so little interest in this conversation that it hardly merits mentioning here, but I will say this: I have a small circle of writers whom I trust. If one of those individuals gives the green light for a particular device or software offering, it immediately jumps to the top of my list next time I need such a product. If, after purchasing something on one of their recommendations, it actually turns out to be terrible for legitimate reasons&#160;&#8212;&#160;in other words, not because I just didn&#8217;t like the color scheme, for example; there must be a tangible problem with the item&#160;&#8212;&#160;I will never buy something they recommend again&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s just that simple. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Outside of that, what else is there to say? Use common sense, and if the combination of your common sense and their credibility still manages to let a subpar product through, reconsider how high a regard you hold that individual in.</p>

<p>As for blog sponsorships, I would be lying if I said I was surprised: with the exception of using 5by5&#8217;s &#8220;dansentme&#8221; code at Hover last year to purchase this domain, I have never visited a sponsor&#8217;s website, much less purchased one of their products. Hover, Squarespace, Rackspace, Host Gator, PDF Pen Pro&#160;&#8212;&#160;they all have successfully attained some non-insignificant amount of mindshare, and if I ever need a domain, an easy-to-setup website, a server, or the ability to edit PDFs I know where to go; however, right now I have no need for any of them save the first, and I would bet anything that I am not alone in this regard. Apple could have the best advertising in the world, and many would argue that they do, but regardless of their marketing prowess I will not buy another computer for another two to five years; advertising cannot create need where there is none, no matter how great the solution may be. Unfortunately&#160;&#8212;&#160;for content producers, fortunately for the companies paying them&#160;&#8212;&#160;advertisers are now starting to realize this. The sponsorship bubble is popping.</p>

<p>Operating under the <a href="http://xkcd.com/1339/">assumption</a> that the sponsorship bubble is, in fact, either about to pop or popping, the first question we must ask is to what extent this will affect the blogging community at large. Just as Germans carted around wheelbarrows full of Marks after World War I when hyperinflation caused the value of their currency to fall to near-unimaginable levels, will bloggers come to shop around sites with readerships in the millions without a single buyer? I say no, for the very reason that all those dollars in sponsorships were not quite useless up until now: mindshare. There is still value in exposing your brand to some four million people on Daring Fireball, and another million on Loop Insight. Even if just to get your foot into the door, as Hover and Squarespace in particular did with me, economies of scale kick in here, with these large audiences, where it does not with smaller readerships. Rather than those at the top, then, it&#8217;s the &#8220;little guy&#8221; like Marco who will suffer the ill effects of this shift, and the actual little guy like those just starting out who will now have to search for alternate revenue models. I hope that these new constraints will breed creativity, and we will begin to see alternative business models, but in reality that hope is nothing more than just that&#160;&#8212;&#160;me hoping. In reality, we have turned a corner&#160;&#8212;&#160;plain as day&#160;&#8212;&#160;and anyone arguing otherwise needs to spend some more time in this industry. We are on the edge, and as <a href="https://twitter.com/danbenjamin/status/444948465714335745">Dan Benjamin is so fond of saying</a>, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what comes next.&#8221;</p>

<p>On my way to San Salvador last weekend I wrote a short article titled &#8220;The Changing Landscape of Innovation&#8221;. Without any internet connection until arriving back home the following Thursday, I planned on publishing it Friday morning; however, I didn&#8217;t count on Drafts losing the note to a botched sync operation. In lieu of that article, then, as I try to work with Greg Pierce to recover it, consider this:</p>

<p>When the iPhone first launched, one of its most notable aspects was the absence of any carrier branding: unlike other phones sporting Verizon or another network&#8217;s logo, Apple had stuck to their guns and shipped a phone free of all marketing material save one: the hallmark of technological craftsmanship, an apple. Fast-forward a few years and most high-end phones have followed suit: by and large, the majority of the top smartphones are free of carrier branding in favor of the parent company&#8217;s name or logo. What started out as an anomaly has become the norm. Although today the significance of this precedent has been all but lost to time, it cannot be understated; the launch of the iPhone marked the first time the liberal arts triumphed over corporate ambition&#160;&#8212;&#160;in the smartphone market, anyway.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Apple announced CarPlay; unsurprisingly, it debuted in some of the world&#8217;s most prestigious vehicles. Nevertheless, in the face of this exclusivity, Apple retained its hallmark brand integrity by completely removing the option for any manufacturer to make any interface tweaks to Apple&#8217;s newest software offering. In fact, it had the opposite effect: whereas phones were once emblazoned with the carrier&#8217;s logo, and by that same reasoning we might have reasonably expected a similar customization in CarPlay, Apple bucked this trend once again in forcing the most exclusive car manufacturers in the world to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/gallery/ferrari-ff-apple-carplay-hands-on/2463625/#!slide=2463641">add a button</a> to their consoles. I say &#8220;Apple bucked this trend once again&#8221;, but in reality it was Tim Cook: he did not delegate a deal of this magnitude to a peon, and so therefore we can wholly attribute this continuation of a long-held Apple value&#160;&#8212;&#160;to explicitly state it once again, the refusal to lower its brand value by adding another&#8217;s alongside it&#160;&#8212;&#160;to none other than Apple&#8217;s current CEO, Tim Cook.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to stop spouting &#8220;what would Steve Jobs do?&#8221; and its innumerable permutations and derivations with the same religious fervor that drives Christians to wear wristbands questioning &#8220;WWJD?&#8221; Steve Jobs has passed, and in his time he did incredible things; however, the Tim Cook era has begun, and so far we&#8217;re off to one hell of a start.</p>

<p>Nice to finally have some closure on this subject. I never got into Flappy Bird&#160;&#8212;&#160;I never even downloaded the game&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I couldn&#8217;t help but get sucked into the &#8220;discussion&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use that term loosely here&#160;&#8212;&#160;around the game, especially after its creator took Flappy Bird down at the peak of its popularity. I wish him good luck in the future; he has been remarkably blessed, and I have no doubt he will make good use of that good fortune.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning at three o&#8217;clock, I will wake up three hours earlier than normal; within sixty minutes of getting out of bed, I will be on my way to the Pittsburgh International Airport; five hours after awakening&#160;&#8212;&#160;if all goes well, and weather permitting&#160;&#8212;&#160;my plane will take off bound for the Bahamian island of San Salvador where I will reside for a week as part of a geology class I enrolled in at the beginning of this semester. After several weeks of in-class study, this trip will allow my class and I to gain valuable field experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;hence the class title, &#8220;Field Investigative Geology&#8221;. Because I will go San Salvador with the express purpose of gaining field experience, due to the research center&#8217;s isolated and somewhat dated nature, and as a result of the island&#8217;s location far outside of America&#8217;s borders, I will have no way of accessing the internet from Wednesday morning until the following Friday. As a courtesy to all my readers, then, rather than simply going off-grid for an entire week without notice, I just wanted to take a moment and give you a heads-up.</p>

<p>Over the past few days I have made a point of posting frequently in an effort at working my way through the queue of articles I stored in Instapaper; a few minutes ago, when I posted <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-the-book.html"><em>Cabin Porn, the book</em></a>, I finally emptied it so as to start with a clean slate when I get home. Shortly after returning, as I begin working my way through the inevitable backlog of news stories and articles published in my absence, I will resume my normal posting schedule. Until then though, I will enjoy the sun, the beach, and the warm air. See you next week.</p>

<p>I will include a link to this page in my upcoming Cabin Porn roundup post, but in an effort at being timely I will also do so here: the great folks over at Beaver Brook that run Cabin Porn, the main site from which I glean those cool images to fill my monthly roundups, are making a book.

<p>Although written in the same vein as all those articles about Tim Cook where the collective discourse was invariably framed by the comparison to Steve Jobs and his legacy, published for much too long after Tim became Apple&#8217;s latest CEO, here such a format actually felt appropriate as the author&#160;&#8212;&#160;taking from Yukari Kane&#8217;s upcoming book <em>Haunted Empire, Apple After Steve Jobs</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;did so to contrast the two very different leadership styles of these two individuals. What&#8217;s more, I found this brief excerpt all the more interesting as the first in-depth article I have seen about Tim Cook in particular. About time.</p>

<p>Fantastic take ostensibly on the problems facing podcasters with regards to discoverability, but in reality a thinly-veiled critique of all those who complain about having the greatest undiscovered app, show, or website rather than focusing their efforts on bringing that undoubtedly exquisite labor of love to a broader audience. I have fallen into this trap in the past, so having a slap-in-the-face reality check like this one to keep me focused on what really matters, and what will actually make a difference in my own work, is especially helpful, and something I will definitely return to multiple times in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>Just as early nineteenth century Americans took Britain&#8217;s manufacturing process, improved upon it, and quickly outpaced the nation from which they originally learned from, so too it appears China learned from the early mistakes that befell American internet companies, improved upon their flaws, and now seeks to outpace the country from which they drew those original lessons. So says this article from <a href="http://digitstodollars.com">Digits to Dollars</a>, anyway, and after reading it I am inclined to agree: as of late the notion of Google becoming an internet conglomerate, or &#8220;General Internet&#8221; as Horace Dediu and many others have put it, has gained a significant amount of traction. The larger notion of &#8220;conglomeratization&#8221; has also grown quite popular, and with Facebook&#8217;s recent acquisition of Whatsapp some have even gone on to say that Facebook could become <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/social-conglomerate/">the social conglomerate</a>. Halfway around the world, however, as this article from Digits to Dollars points out, many Chinese internet companies have already made the switch that only the largest American internet companies are just now showing signs of considering. Very interesting, and possible even telling, observation.</p>

<p>The &#8220;fake it &#8217;till you make it&#8221; mentality and impostor syndrome are closely linked, in that the former is often cited as a solution to the latter. Especially in the creative professions, where impostor syndrome seems nearly as common as clicky keyboards, many advocate overriding that feeling of inadequacy with a philosophy that accepts it as a given and pushes you past it: you may feel like an impostor&#160;&#8212;&#160;a fake&#160;&#8212;&#160;but that&#8217;s okay, because you can fake it until you actually meet your expectations in a particular area&#160;&#8212;&#160;in other words, until you make it. If an article on that mentality&#8217;s adverse effects does not interest you though&#160;&#8212;&#160;and really, if you fall prey or subscribe to either frame of mind, it should&#160;&#8212;&#160;come for Sam&#8217;s look into the &#8220;dark&#8221;, less morally-sound side of making money on the internet. The same group that often suffers from impostor syndrome simultaneously prize making money ethically through relationships with those they create for. Not everyone on the internet has this same value system though, so coming from the former I found it interesting to read about the perspective of the latter.</p>

<p>I have long wanted for a place I could link to great podcasts and point out particularly spectacular episodes, but neither my site nor my now-deceased newsletter seemed like the appropriate venue for such posts. Nevertheless, for especially noteworthy shows, I have broken this unspoken rule and linked to Exponent&#8217;s <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-garbage-truck-song.html">The Garbage Truck Song</a>, for example, and The Weekly Briefly&#8217;s <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-writing-guide.html">A Writing Guide</a>. Yet although I did occasionally point out an especially good episode here on my site, countless others went unmentioned and thus unlauded for excellence in any number of areas merely because I lacked a medium in which to highlight such work. Today, hot on the heels of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/me-the-writer.html">ending my last weekly publication</a>, I will begin posting another weekly roundup&#160;&#8212;&#160;this time here on my site&#160;&#8212;&#160;showcasing the past week&#8217;s greatest additions to the podcasting industry.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-19-wil-shipley-next-delicious-monster">Debug 19: Wil Shipley from NeXT to Delicious Monster</a>. Although not released within the last week, I listened to this phenomenal episode of Debug on Monday. Wil Shipley&#160;&#8212;&#160;the explanation for spelling his first name with a single &#8220;L&#8221; made the entire show worth it on its own&#160;&#8212;&#160;told his story all the way from high school to starting The Omni Group and contracting with &#8220;The Air Force&#8221; and NeXT before getting forced out of his company in true Jobsian style and going on to help found Delicious Monster. Even if you have no interest in any of the companies I just named, Wil is such a fantastic storyteller you would be missing out if you didn&#8217;t set aside an hour to listen to this timeless tale.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-99-white-ribbon.html">Roderick on the Line Ep.99: &#8220;White Ribon&#8221;</a>. You must have listened to their previous episode, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-98-a-mastiff-of-spinach.html">A Mastiff of Spinach</a>, in order for any of this one to make sense. And while you&#8217;re in the process of listening to past shows, why not start at <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-00-suit-of-vomit.html">the pilot</a>? Since airing more than two years ago, John and Merlin have discussed everything from the American education system to The Beatles and in the process became one of my favorite podcasts of all time. To list any number of topics covered in this the most recent installment of perhaps the best podcast currently airing would be to do the show an egregious injustice, but if I were forced, I would pick out addiction as one of the headlining themes back again in <em>White Ribbon</em>. Even more important to the show&#8217;s ultimate success than the main topic, however, is the truly unique chemistry between Merlin and John that words&#160;&#8212;&#160;no matter how grandiose and numerous&#160;&#8212;&#160;would never quite capture; Roderick on the Line is one of a very few shows that you must experience before passing judgment on, for to do so based on something so trivial and easily-quantifiable as its main topic would be to make a mistake of gargantuan and near-incalculable proportions.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/85">CMD+SPACE 85: Being a Geek, with John Siracusa</a>. For all you fans of John Siracusa out there&#160;&#8212;&#160;and let&#8217;s be honest, how could you not be a fan of this guy?&#160;&#8212;&#160;Myke Hurley had <a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/34">another</a> great chat with the internet&#8217;s favorite critic. I found this episode quite enjoyable, but ever since Hypercritical my judgment is far from impartial when it comes to anything John does, so perhaps that isn&#8217;t saying much. Check it out for yourself, and get back to me.</p>

<p><a href="http://shawnblanc.net/members/">Shawn Today</a>. Shawn Blanc records a daily podcast solely for members of his website; every week, he releases Shawn Today&#8217;s Friday episode for everyone to listen to as part of another show called The Weekly Briefly both as a way to broaden the show&#8217;s reach and give potential subscribers that last push before becoming members. Last week, I became a member late one night just in time for <a href="http://weeklybriefly.net/a-writing-guide/">a fantastic episode on writing</a> with Patrick Rhone the following Friday, released as part of The Weekly Briefly. Since publishing that episode, Shawn has released two more members-only broadcasts on increased competition as The Sweet Setup&#8217;s chosen niche begins to fill, and another about writing in an increasingly competitive space where differentiation becomes more of a problem every day. I wish I could link to either or both of these, but they are only available to subscribers. Honestly though, at $4 a month, these shows are easily worth ten times as much; go subscribe, listen to these episodes, and help a great writer out during <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/02/the-2014-membership-drive-and-giveaway/">his annual membership drive and giveaway</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://thevoicemail.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/episode-087/">The Voicemail: Episode 087</a>. Shortly after Stefan Constantinescu started publishing daily collections of news links, I discovered that he and James Whatley record a weekly podcast called <a href="http://thevoicemail.net">The Voicemail</a>. Curious, I subscribed and found <a href="http://thevoicemail.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/episode-086/">their episode discussing Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of WhatsApp</a> very interesting. This week, after more articles than I could count and innumerable tweets came out of Mobile World Conference, Stefan and James released their two-cents in the eighty-seventh installment of The Voicemail. During this episode, they had a hilarious discussion of the conference itself and Samsung&#8217;s latest phone, the Galaxy S5, interspersed with some hard-hitting analyses of the companies that participated in this event. Until those behemoths change their fundamental approach to the mobile industry, this will remain a particularly relevant show; in other words, even after this year&#8217;s hubbub dies down, the observations expressed within the all-too-brief forty-one minutes will remain pertinent for years to come.</p>

<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/bionic/81">Bionic 81</a>. Like the previously-linked Roderick on the Line you really ought to have listened to all of Bionic&#8217;s earlier episodes for maximum enjoyment during this one, but even if you haven&#8217;t I guarantee you will enjoy Matt and Myke&#8217;s process of naming their storefront; absolutely hilarious. Like Roderick on the Line, Bionic is another one of those polarizing shows where everyone either loves or hates it, with few falling anywhere in the middle. I fall squarely in the middle of the former camp, and I can&#8217;t imagine why you would not as well after listening to this episode. So, so good.</p>

<p>These are my favorite episodes from some really great podcasts, released within the past week. Some of these shows you are undoubtedly familiar with, while others I am sure you have never heard of. They all made this list for attaining excellence in some aspect though, so I hope you will give them all a chance because I know that if you do, you will enjoy them just as much as I did.</p>

<p>I have a very light issue for you this month, unfortunately: precious little caught my eye over the past few weeks. In fact, just two articles did, and only one came from Cabin Porn: a <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/77427808607/3rd-generation-hand-made-family-cabin-on-the-upper">third-generation hand-made cabin from Michigan</a>. This structure, to me, defines the genre: built of wood and stone and out in the middle of the woods, not some modern architecture retrofitted into a rustic getaway a few hundred feet from the nearest road, this cabin has <em>character</em>. And I love that about it.</p>

<p>The second and final link comes from Vimeo, by way of Twitter: <a href="http://vimeo.com/87155994">Zen and the Art of Powder Boarding</a>. Although I&#8217;m not convinced the video&#8217;s creators did not just prepend the title with &#8220;zen&#8221; in an attempt at making it somehow more attractive to potential viewers, I did find myself enjoying this short view into the world of powder boarding. I&#8217;m no snowboarder&#160;&#8212;&#160;barely a skier&#160;&#8212;&#160;but even if just to visit all the neat places filmed here, I would love to become one.</p>

<p>I sat down to catch up on some long-overdue reading with Sid O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s recent article <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/earn-your-tools"><em>Earn Your Tools</em></a> the other day, and before I knew it I had gotten sucked in to the world of every day carry. When I finally resurfaced and finished Sid&#8217;s article, after embarking upon more tangents than I could possibly remember along the way, I found myself wholeheartedly agreeing with him: all too often, especially in Boy Scouts, I see kids touting some fancy piece of gear despite having no idea how to use it both properly and to its full potential, and with little regard for either its worth or its value. To all too many, that price tag was just a number their parents made disappear with the swipe of a credit card. They did not earn the right to that piece of equipment, yet they toss it around as if no more useful or valuable than a sack of potatoes. To borrow a line from Sid&#8217;s article, many of these kids truly are &#8220;that idiot with the shiny new thing who thinks he&#8217;s bought himself into the ranks of the talented.&#8221;</p>

<p>Growing up (and I say this at nineteen, so bear with me and try to take that without too much irony) I was fortunate enough to have to buy at least a portion of my gear, or wait until my birthday and Christmas to get that cool new thing. That&#8217;s how I got my first backpack upon joining The Boy Scouts at fourteen: I bought a green canvas rucksack from a military surplus shop with my own money, and loved that thing until I had to confront the unfortunate reality that it was better suited to carrying books around than a tent and equipment for a weekend away from home. I still have that bag in the back of my closet beneath its successor, a full-fledged hiking backpack complete with an internal frame and more space than I knew what to do with at the time. Like the one before it, I took great care with this bag also&#160;&#8212;&#160;it was my money on the line, after all, and I would not waste it. After a few summers, a week on the Appalachian Trail, and a broken strap though, I finally decided to upgrade, and so I moved to the external-frame pack I have today. Although significantly smaller, I prefer this to its larger predecessor because it not only forces me to bring much less extra <em>crap</em> with me than I would otherwise, but makes the hike exponentially easier as a result of that restriction as well. These two traits were more than enough to push me towards this type of pack design, even if some do consider it made for children given the emphasis it places on minimal and light packing; I&#8217;ll leave the consideration of this asinine reasoning as an exercise for you, the reader, so that you may draw your own conclusions. Although I think of replacing this backpack every so often, I have no strong desire nor need to any time soon.</p>

<p>I went through a similar process with flashlights: starting from <a href="http://www.armynavyshop.com/prods/rc638.html">an unwieldy D-cell</a> resplendent with a fragile halogen bulb, it took me quite a while to graduate to a generic Rayovac headlamp&#160;&#8212;&#160;you know, the one you might find in the &#8220;Battery Center&#8221; at your local WalMart. In fact, I had that until two years ago when I finally got tired of having to stumble around in the dark with nothing but the feeble glow of a subpar flashlight to guide me along my way, so I upgraded to the fantastic <a href="http://www.fenixlighting.com/products/fenix-flashlights-pd32-led-flashlight.aspx">Fenix PD32</a> after a great deal of research. Extremely satisfied with every aspect of this flashlight, I added the <a href="http://www.fenixlighting.com/products/fenix-hp15-headlamp-a98.aspx">Fenix HP15</a> headlamp to my collection last Christmas. I have no intention of replacing either of these in the foreseeable future, nor purchasing any additional lights: these two not only meet my current needs, but exceed them as well.</p>

<p>And then, of course, to get back to the genre that prompted this post in the first place, my approach to finding the perfect pocket knife resembled that of both my backpack and my flashlight, except that it extended much further back in my life. At ten I got my first pocket knife: a Swiss Army <a href="http://www.victorinox.com/us/product/Swiss-Army-Knives/Category/Classics/Classic-SD/53001">Classic SD</a>. This gift set off a chain of events that had me working in pursuit of the perfect pocket knife for the next nine years. I went through multiple Swiss Army multi-tools, a tin full of no-name one-offs, a Leatherman, and a Winchester before finally settling on my current blade of choice: <a href="http://www.gerbergear.com/Tactical/Knives/Evo-Large-Tanto_31-001755">the Gerber Evo Large Tanto</a>. After nine years and more knives with more tools on them than I care to remember, I finally decided to go with this simple, single-blade knife. Like my flashlights, I plan on sticking with this knife for quite some time.</p>

<p>I have prematurely reached a point in my life where I no longer want to settle for anything: I want to eat good food, watch good movies, listen to good music, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;most of all&#160;&#8212;&#160;I want great gear. Whereas it takes most people a lifetime to reach this point, I have somehow managed to get here after just nineteen short years. With regards to technology, that means an iPhone as the always-on computer in my pocket, a MacBook Pro in my backpack, and an iPad to replace the gargantuan Calculus textbook I would otherwise have had to carry around. Most kids my age settle for a PC. In my glove box I have a 340 lumen monster; others store minuscule maglites in there without thinking of the scenarios in which they may need a flashlight, and how those situations would likely necessitate something slightly more powerful. When I go out to eat, everyone else in the restaurant outranks both me and my girlfriend by twenty years at the very least, and usually twice that much; we prefer to eat well in nice restaurants, even if everyone else our age is perfectly happy at O&#8217;Chrley&#8217;s. We have been dating for just shy of two years now, and have yet to eat at a fast-food &#8220;restaurant&#8221;. I cannot say for sure that I have earned the right to these preferences that dictate such decisions and such a lifestyle as befitting someone much older&#160;&#8212;&#160;much more world-weary&#160;&#8212;&#160;than I, but I can say this: if I have not, I will continue working every day so that some day I can claim that coveted right and finally earn not only my tools, but the lifestyle that flows from the desire that prompted me to choose them over inferior alternatives in the first place as well.</p>

<p>Late last year <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/filson-4x4.html">I linked to</a> another, similar post from Huckberry on the <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/filson-4x4">Filson 4X4</a>. Like Filson&#8217;s modified Jeep, Starwood Motors made significant modifications to this once-run-of-the-mill vehicle, transforming it into something remarkably cool&#160;&#8212;&#160;perhaps even cooler than its impressive cousin, also linked in Huckberry&#8217;s post, the <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/starwood-full-metal-jacket-jeep/">Starwood Full Metal Jacket Jeep</a>. Although at $72,888 and $107,000, respectively, both will remain far outside of my price range for the foreseeable future, I can always look, and look I definitely will.</p>

<p>Worthwhile distinction to be aware of not only for those targeted by tech company announcements, but those writing about them as well. All too often tech writers use these and countless other terms interchangeably when in reality, they are nowhere near synonymous.</p>

<p>Interesting examination the of story ranking system Hacker News employs, and much more scientific than <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/algorithmic-ineptitude.html">my previous attempt</a>. Ken Shirriff&#8217;s earlier article on the topic, <a href="http://www.righto.com/2009/06/how-does-newsyc-ranking-work.html"><em>Inside the news.yc ranking formula</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in case you miss the link in his latest post&#160;&#8212;&#160;, also warrants some attention as both try to explain the fickle and near-inscrutable internet fire hose that is Hacker News. I found these two articles especially interesting given a recent project I have begun work on, but I won&#8217;t spoil that here.</p>

<p>Somewhat interesting article explaining the reasons behind the aspects that lead many to consider academic writing so terrible. For the most part, I agree: in my experience, the academic community&#160;&#8212;&#160;or, at the very least, the subset involved in literary pursuits&#160;&#8212;&#160;is incredibly out of touch with not only current trends in their professed field of interest, but averse and close-minded to change in that field as well. This is especially true&#160;&#8212;&#160;painfully so&#160;&#8212;&#160;of those who for some reason believe that they are bucking the system&#160;&#8212;&#160;particularly the ones who graduated within the last few years&#160;&#8212;&#160;and put down that old five paragraph format as outdated before going on to teach their favorite derivation of it. Unfortunately, I am nowhere near as confident in the revival of this once-praiseworthy system as Joshua Rothman is: if the academic community cannot change their writing style, what hope do we have that they will bring about meaningful change to the underlying system?</p>

<p>Apple acquired another company&#160;&#8212;&#160;great, wonderful; the most interesting news I saw after this announcement, however, came from Federico Viticci when he highlighted a recent idea MG Siegler put forth before Christmas in suggesting a Beta App Store. From Federico&#8217;s article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;On a related rumor note, the Burstly acquisition may also indicate Apple&#8217;s intention to launch a &#8216;beta App Store&#8217; service for developers to test apps publicly with subsets of users in specific regions or demographics. The idea was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/16/beta-app-store/">first suggested by MG Siegler</a> in December 2013 and <a href="https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/436934869818425344">brought up</a> again <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/436942086932140032">today</a> following the acquisition news.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very interesting. If you, like me before coming across it by way of Federico&#8217;s article, have not read MG&#8217;s piece, I encourage you to do so: he makes a strong case for this idea. It still needs some work and presents a number of potential issues&#160;&#8212;&#160;allowing anyone access to this testing ground seems problematic, to say the least; there&#8217;s a very good reason betas of Apple&#8217;s operating systems and apps are restricted to those with a developer account&#160;&#8212;&#160;but these challenges are by no means insurmountable. And MG is right: it&#8217;s high-time Apple gave its developers these capabilities.</p>

<p>I said it in <a href="http://eepurl.com/OxOsj">the last edition of my newsletter</a> and alluded to it in <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/437330929363595264">a recent tweet</a>, but I&#8217;ll say it again here: I&#8217;m not at all excited for Marvel&#8217;s upcoming movie. Iron Man 3, The Avengers, and even Thor: The Dark World&#160;&#8212;&#160;although to a lesser degree there&#160;&#8212;&#160;all spent way too much time and energy in pursuit of humor. In some cases, it paid off: the scene where Hulk tossed Loki around before calling him a &#8220;puny god&#8221; was great, and Loki&#8217;s scene where he impersonated a number of other Marvel characters with Thor in their latest film was delightful. By and large though, that humor has no place in action movies. Marvel ought to pick one or the other and stop aiming for both genres, because they invariably meet both criteria poorly. Better to focus on a single goal than spread themselves too thin. There&#8217;s a particularly worthwhile analogy to writing here, but I will leave it to you, the reader, to make.</p>

<p>Interesting article from MIT&#8217;s Technology Review on Bitcoin&#8217;s potential uses outside of a new currency. I have written to the topic of Bitcoin a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-on-bitcoin.html">few times</a> in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-bitcoin-will-plummet.html">the past</a>, but beyond covering it here I have had no interaction with Bitcoin whatsoever. Nevertheless, it remains a topic of great interest to me, and will undoubtedly go on to play a significant role in the future of not only global currencies, but internet commerce of all types as well.</p>

<p>For the most part I stayed away from articles attempting to explain Facebook&#8217;s reasoning in acquiring WhatsApp. That is, until Ben Thompson posted his take, where he continued the &#8220;company-as-conglomerate&#8221; <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/2/19/ways-of-thinking-about-google">trend</a> in dubbing Facebook the Social Conglomerate. Although I found myself nodding in agreement to the majority of his post, I did take issue with one bit: towards the end, Ben called Apple a personal computing conglomerate; however, I believe a more apt designation would call Apple the quality conglomerate, pursuing excellence in not only hardware, but every aspect of the computing experience. One could certainly argue their effectiveness across the board&#160;&#8212;&#160;iCloud probably being the poster child against using &#8220;quality&#8221; as the operative word in that sentence&#160;&#8212;&#160;but you get points for trying in this game, not only for succeeding; case and point Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>More of a problem than not having Microsoft Office available for iOS, I think, is the strict siloing Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system enforces: I can fulfill all my Office-related needs with Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, but trying to find away around the cumbersome process of opening a document in Dropbox, sending it to Numbers for editing, and then finding a way to get it back into Dropbox so my seventy-five year old uncle can edit the spreadsheet on his computer is a massive barrier to entry for him buying an iPad; in the end, I had no choice but to recommend a Surface. Although the absence of cellular capabilities in the Surface is thankfully pushing him back towards the iPad, the mere fact that I had no choice but to recommend the former highlights a huge shortcoming in the latter.</p>

<p>Looking for a fun read over the slow weekend? Check out Linus Edwards&#8217; article <em>The Existential Plight Of The Video Game Hero</em>. I planned on linking to it in my newsletter shortly after he published the piece earlier this week on Monday, but got mired in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/me-the-writer.html">the uncertainty that ultimately led to that newsletter ending</a> before I got the chance. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a pretty short read. I look forward to seeing more work in this genre from him in the future though, so if you&#160;&#8212;&#160;like me&#160;&#8212;&#160;really enjoy this piece, check back often: I doubt either of us will have to wait long.</p>

<p>Speaking of great podcasts, Ben Thompson and James Allworth just started a new show called <a href="http://exponent.fm"><em>Exponent</em></a>. In their first episode, released just a few days ago on Thursday, the pair took an interesting look at disruption theory, the innovator&#8217;s dilemma, and culture as those aspects pertain to Microsoft and Apple&#8217;s past and present situation as well influence their future directions. Rather than spending the majority of their time discussing Apple though, as many of today&#8217;s tech podcast hosts are want to do, Ben and James had one of the most level-headed, intelligent, and engaging discussions on Microsoft I have heard since the company became a headline-worthy topic once again with the elevation of Satya Nadella to CEO. Any show with this impressive roster would be worth taking note of, but these two outdid themselves here: if their future episodes are anywhere near as good as this one, Exponent is going to grow into quite the remarkable show.</p>

<p>Shawn Blanc and Patrick Rhone are two of my favorite writers. For this week&#8217;s installment of The Weekly Briefly, they teamed up and recorded <em>A Writing Guide</em> where they shared their thoughts on writing, motivation, building an audience, and putting yourself out there. Regardless of how good a writer you consider yourself, whether you follow these two or not, and even if you never intend to take writing beyond a nights-and-weekends hobby, I cannot recommend this episode enough: out of the hundreds of hours I have spent listening to podcasts over the last five years, this is by far and away one of the best&#160;&#8212;&#160;if not <em>the</em> best&#160;&#8212;&#160;episodes on writing I have ever listened to.</p>

<p>I can see it now: &#8220;I just bought the 5S, but I&#8217;m going to go get the all new one when it comes out later this year.&#8221; Talk about a cumbersome naming convention: in this case the speaker is clearly talking about purchasing the latest iPhone, <em>or is he?</em> Point is, no one really knows. What a curious and poorly-executed mimicry of Apple&#8217;s admittedly clumsy naming convention by which they eschew model numbers on their iPads in favor of prepending the device&#8217;s name with &#8220;the new&#8221;. And that&#8217;s to say nothing of Apple&#8217;s inexplicable aversion to articles before product names&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;iPad Mini now has a Retina display&#8221;, for example, rather than &#8220;<em>The</em> iPad Mini now has a Retina display&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;or the initialism debacle with the 5S whereby all of Apple&#8217;s marketing materials had it listed as the &#8220;5s&#8221; in stark contrast to all previous &#8220;S&#8221; models which sported the properly-capitalized &#8220;S&#8221;. It would be so much easier if everyone could just pick a sensible and unique naming convention, and then stick to it. Hat-tip to <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/2/19/february-19-46-tabs"><em>February 19: 46 tabs</em></a> from Stefan Constantinescu for the link.</p>

<p>&#8220;Build a Large Readership and Earn Your First Dollar&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s a goal everyone that writes on the internet strives for, but few know how to reach. Wired Writers Guild features lessons and articles designed to provide that information. Although I&#8217;m only on day three of their daily series, I have already started benefiting from them: their second issue, asking me to formalize my motivations to write and the audience I wish to target, prompted me to think long and hard about these topics and ultimately resulted in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/me-the-writer.html"><em>Me the Writer</em></a>, which kicked off a number of changes including the cessation of my newsletter and a minor redesign. If you can&#8217;t get in to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/next-draft.html">NextDraft and TabDump</a>, or even if you can and you want a really great writing resource at your disposal, I strongly encourage you to check Wired Writers Guild out.</p>

<p>Originally published under the title &#8220;Future Mac Fans Will Be Smaller And Quieter Than Ever [Patent]&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t help but link to this blatant attack from Luke Dormehl. Who is he to predict the vocality or physical dimensions of Mac fans in the future? We are a community made of diverse individuals both outspoken and introverted; small and large. To so insensitively equate each and every one of us, then, making such a broad generalization as to our future is not only a claim completely unsubstantiable, but remarkably offensive as well. Getting just a little cocky over there at Cult of Mac, aren&#8217;t we?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to fill the void left by my now-discontinued newsletter, you could do much worse than Dave Pell&#8217;s NextDraft. I subscribed a few days ago upon a friend&#8217;s recommendation, and have enjoyed every issue since. It&#8217;s billed as &#8220;the day&#8217;s most fascinating news&#8221; so while you won&#8217;t see the more obscure type of links I tended to throw in my newsletter, Dave makes up for it with great curation. The byline does not lie: NextDraft really does feature the day&#8217;s most fascinating news. Alternately, if a daily newsletter isn&#8217;t your thing, Stefan Constantinescu publishes a daily blog post collecting interesting news articles from the past twenty-four hours in much the same way Dave Pell does with NextDraft. I wrote a short post linking to one such collection a few weeks ago, which you can find <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/57-tabs.html">here</a>. I subscribe to both, but I realize that not everyone will find both equally attractive. So pick whichever suits your needs; you can&#8217;t go wrong either way.</p>

<p>A few days ago The Typist and I spent an evening talking about a number of things, one of which dealt with the difficulty of developing an audience. During that conversation, he made a rather interesting observation, saying that the giants of today&#8217;s tech scene made a name for themselves by writing about more than just one topic, whereas the common refrain these days dictates that a fledgling writer must pick one subject and stick to it. I responded in favor of this advice, for at the time I believed it the best way to differentiate oneself from the thousands of unfocused others clamoring for the finite resource that is time and attention. As I sought to explain myself though, I slowly came to realize that the advantages of this approach I considered so obvious were, in reality, not quite as clear-cut as I thought.</p>

<p>To illustrate my point, consider John Gruber&#8217;s site: even back when he started Daring Fireball in August of 2002, he wrote almost exclusively about technology. Sure, he had the occasional linked list item pointing to an article on another topic, but by and large he remained within the confines of his chosen subject. Through a combination of that focus and his unique personality, John Gruber grew quite famous over the following years. Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s Loop Insight, on the other hand, whose earliest article dates back to June of 2009, has featured practically every topic imaginable. In stark contrast to John&#8217;s more focused approach Jim comes off as much more erratic, choosing to write about anything and everything that falls within his realm of interest. Through a combination of that different degree of focus and his unique personality, Jim Dalrymple also grew quite famous over the following years.</p>

<p>In each case we have an individual with a wildly different approach, yet both achieved great success regardless of how you measure such a subjective goal. And there are many more examples at both ends of the spectrum as well: Federico Viticci covers almost exclusively iOS apps and Apple technology. His work falls into the more focused category, and this choice has fostered a large following as a result. Marco Arment, on the other hand, comments on technology every so often, but drew an incredible amount of attention for his in-depth review of light bulbs; sometimes he talks about development, and at other times he writes articles on coffee and amps. Marco falls into the erratic category, then, and no one could argue against his impressive success as a result of that decision. As I tried to simultaneously marshal my thoughts and speak in favor of a singular focus over its broader alternative, I finally became conscious of these markedly different approaches: whereas by the former a writer focuses on a single topic and denies&#160;&#8212;&#160;or chooses to ignore, at the very least&#160;&#8212;&#160;any additional interests, ascribing to the latter strategy means that the writer acknowledges the entirety of his diverse passions and writes with them in mind. As previously demonstrated, both strategies have merit. The choice, then, as I came to realize while attempting to argue in favor of this methodology, comes down to target audience: do you wish to attract those who share your enthusiasm for you the personification of a single topic, or would you rather target those who share your enthusiasm for you the writer? To put it another way, do you want an audience to read you for that one aspect of yourself, or because you are a multi-faceted and complex individual by nature, with wide-ranging interests likely encompassing more than a single subject? That is the question I have struggled with since shortly after I started this site, and the one I only just now managed to quantify into a concrete query I could have any hope of answering.</p>

<p>My own website started out lacking focus, and so I had articles on writing abutting posts showcasing a cool image I found on Cabin Porn, next to another entry linking to a neat code project. Lately, however, I sought to increase my focus by talking solely about technology, writing, and other topics related to this small tech blogger bubble I live within. Pursuant of this goal, I started a newsletter as the outlet for everything that did not fall into one of those aforementioned categories. In other words, all the things that previously went to my site, but no longer do resultant of this increasingly aggressive filter, went to my newsletter. This seemed like a great idea at the time: start another venture in a different medium, and use that as a channel to allow me greater focus when writing &#8220;serious&#8221; work on my website. The last few weeks have proved this not quite as great an idea as I originally thought though, and so now I have returned to the familiar inflection point of scope and venue, albeit this time from the other side: last time I came from broad focus conveyed in a single medium, and crossed this line as I narrowed my focus and broadened my attention to two properties; this time, however, as I near that zero, I am coming from narrow focus and multiple properties and approaching less focused work across a single venture. The question of whether I should cross that inflection point is the same one I posed earlier: do I want to write for the admittedly sizable segment whose interests in technology, writing, and other similar topics overlap with mine, or would I prefer to write to the other sizable segment that want to follow Zac the writer?</p>

<p>I have published five issues of my newsletter over the last six weeks. During that time, I have had a great deal of fun putting The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter together, and significantly less fun working with this site. What started as a secondary priority is verging on my primary now, aiming to replace my website as not only the place I take the most joy in writing for, but the place I end up writing the most for as well. In talking with The Typist a few days ago, I finally realized that this shift in preference is not because I no longer have anything to say, or because I have writer&#8217;s block, or because I lost interest in the creative process. On the contrary, this shift began because in pursuit of bettering my writing, I started approaching it from the wrong direction entirely: I am not meant to talk about technology and writing and other related topics to the exclusion of everything else that I find great and interesting. While that may work for some, and for some very well, it will not for me. I have more interests than those three topics, and I want to write to the segment of my readers that will appreciate those additional interests. I have tried both approaches, and having done so I can make my choice: I choose to write as Zac the person, not Zac the personification of this singular viewpoint on a mere handful of topics; because otherwise this is no longer fun for me, and as soon as it ceases to be fun, I cease to write. But that won&#8217;t happen, so let me tell you what will:</p>

<p>As of tomorrow, when I send out the sixth installment of The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter, I will cease work on this publication. I have enjoyed the last six weeks immensely: curating links in the more informal format I adopted has made for a very rewarding experience, and the response has been great; I am flattered to have made something deserving of the subscribers it has attracted thus far. To everyone that gave me a shot at adding yet another email to their inbox every weekend, I thank you. However, I did not enjoy creating this newsletter enough to sacrifice my website for it, for in reality that is the decision I would have had to make in the near future had I chosen to stick with the path I am currently on. Perhaps I will revive this newsletter at some point in the future, or take it another direction. For now, though, I have to put a stop to this good thing that will, given more time, turn in to a bad one I will forever regret not stopping when I had the chance.</p>

<p>To my loyal readers for whom I am more grateful than you may ever know, don&#8217;t fret: the same person that built that weekly newsletter, the same sensibilities that gleaned neat and interesting links every week, and the same voice that presented them, is not going anywhere: I&#8217;m staying right here, and everything that I would have sent to MailChimp will now come right here, to my site, because I&#8217;m finished writing as me the topic; from now on, I will write as me the writer.</p>

<p>Interesting perspective from Stefan Constantinescu on the news. There has been a great deal of talk in similar veins as of late, questioning not only the relevance of articles written in response to news stories, but their long-term value as well. This question has been posed as particularly damning to the Apple-tech-blog niche, where it combines with the oft-cited criticism that this segment&#8217;s participants do little but constantly compliment one another. Taken in tandem, they form a juggernaut of sorts calling in to question the very worth of the profession so many writers have devoted themselves to. In the coming weeks, months, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;hopefully&#160;&#8212;&#160;years, this is a question I must think about long and hard, for my answer will inform the direction I ultimately take this site in.</p>

<p>Yes, the title is maybe a little too sensational for my liking; yes, &#8220;Financial Samurai&#8221; is a bit ostentatious. But you know what? Sam Dogen is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers for his terrific financial insight, and that more than makes up for any choice I may disagree with with regards to his approach to writing on the internet. Of all the sites I subscribe to and all the writers I follow, he is the only writer whose work I read regardless of topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s just that good. What&#8217;s more, most of his work&#160;&#8212;&#160;in addition to providing helpful advice I have already gone on to implement as a step towards securing my financial future&#160;&#8212;&#160;can be translated and applied to the career I wish to some day have writing here. His latest article, linked above, is a great example of this valuable combination of practical advice for furthering you both in your career and your life as well, and thus something I strongly recommend you check out; and if you like it, go through his back catalog: each article is just as applicable today as it was when he first published it.</p>

<p>Last night I read <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/flappy-bird-clone-made-with-pythonista-on-ios/">Federico Viticci&#8217;s post</a> about Jumpy Octopus, a Flappy Bird clone made in Python. I had the article open on my computer, so rather than navigate to the source code on my iPad, copy more than three hundred lines, and then paste them into Pythonista, I opened Command-C on both devices and sent my Mac&#8217;s clipboard contents to my iPad. Less than a minute later I had tried, grown frustrated with, and ultimately abandoned the game. This article is not about the object of my distaste though, but about the mechanics that got it there in the first place.</p>

<p>Shortly after I realized the usefulness of a desktop clipboard manager, I decided I wanted a similar utility on my iOS devices. Not just the ability to save and access my clipboard history though, but to sync it across multiple devices as well: ideally, as soon as I copied a sentence, URL, or code snippet, it would become available on every other device I own. In addition to proving extremely useful while researching for and preparing to write new articles&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I could quickly send an excerpt and its URL from iPad to computer, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;this would also remove Dropbox as a middleman for all but a few cases.</p>

<p>On the rare occasion that I write anything on my iPad these days, I use it to create short linked list posts in <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a>. Satisfied with the result, I use a built-in workflow to send a timestamped text files to the &#8220;Drafts&#8221; directory in Dropbox, which I then open on my computer, rename, and publish; after the post goes live, I delete the original. If instead of that convoluted process I could hit &#8220;Send to Clipboard&#8221; and have the post appear instantaneously in my Mac&#8217;s clipboard history, it would obviate the unnecessary files created in my current workflow and thus make it much easier&#160;&#8212;&#160;and perhaps more attractive&#160;&#8212;&#160;to write and publish using my iPad. Even at the onset of my quest I realized the app I desired was but a pipe dream though, but I pressed on nevertheless. I have been surprised by the ingenuity of iOS developers in the past, after all; maybe this time would prove no different.</p>

<p>I had heard tell of an app by the venerable Tapbots, famed creators of the best iOS and OS X Twitter client Tweetbot, for clipboard management similar to what I sought, so I started there with <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/">Pastebot</a>. In addition to being saddled with a dated iOS 6 interface though, something I could have gotten past had it met my second, more important criterion, Pastebot also does not work in the background. That is, in order to send and receive information to and from other devices, I had to open Pastebot and its companion desktop client. At that point, I may as well email myself every URL or continue relying on Dropbox to sync entire files just for a line or two of text. I kept looking.</p>

<p>Shortly after dismissing Pastebot, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/command-c-a-local-clipboard-sharing-tool-for-os-x-and-ios-7/">Command-C launched to great fanfare</a>. Making similar promises as Pastebot had with a revamped interface created with iOS 7 in mind, I bit the bullet and bought the app only to walk away in disappointment as I discovered that other than that shiny new design, Command-C did nothing to improve upon the functionality Pastebot had possessed since iOS 4: I still had to open Command-C on any device I wanted to send the contents of my clipboard from. Disappointment yet again.</p>

<p>Today I still have Command-C on all my devices, but I long for the day I will no longer need to open a dedicated app just to transfer a URL from one device to another. Not that this will ever happen, though: such a utility would necessitate Apple letting third-party apps run constantly in the background, and the likes of Facebook would undoubtedly abuse this newfound ability for stupid things like refreshing its users&#8217;s timeline, because that&#8217;s really important. This inevitable development would then lend itself to poor battery life, and Apple will never allow that; they will never sacrifice battery life so that I can have a universal clipboard, and everyone else can see their Facebook timeline after a smaller delay. Rather than blanket approval Apple could choose to only grant this permission to certain developers during the app approval process, but who is to say a clipboard manager deserves this functionality over Facebook? A much, much larger segment of the market would lobby for the latter over the former, and Facebook unfortunately has a bit more sway with Apple than Tapbots. This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have an infant son to take care of, so I cannot speak to that adventure, but I can speak to its effects: every so often I undergo bouts of insomnia-like symptoms where no matter how much I may want to sleep, regardless of how significantly tomorrow&#8217;s test will effect my grade, it&#8217;s all I can do to hold myself still while my mind races. <em>What am I doing tomorrow? Did I finish all my homework? Will I have time to listen to that latest podcast episode? How about write? It&#8217;s been far too long since I&#8217;ve written anything but a link post. But I have so many articles in Instapaper...will I have time to finish them tomorrow?</em> They say those who sleep well at night will never possess the perspective to truly appreciate the inability to sleep, and I completely agree with that: shortly after these experiences end, as I forget how truly terrible the last few nights were, even I begin to lose perspective; it really wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> bad, after all. But losing sleep is: I never feel motivated to do anything, nothing interests me, I have a short temper and an even shorter tolerance for others, everything loses its luster, and the list goes on and on. Least of all, I feel the urge to create: that&#8217;s the last thing I want to do after managing to fall asleep only to wake up a few hours later. I can only imagine how rough Sid has it right now.</p>

<p>If not the best, for even as I type this I have likely forgotten someone, then Matt Gemmell easily comes in as by far and away one of the greatest writer I have the continued privilege of reading, and one of my favorite as well. Aside from that praise, I have little to say with regards to his latest article: words fail me, and no commendation could do it justice. I am awestruck.</p>

<p>I personally consider Amazon the former: &#8220;a brilliant company investing every penny of cash in building the future&#8221;. Benedict&#8217;s graph seems to support this theory: as revenue increases net income remains approximately zero; where did all that money go if not to infrastructure? Especially given the alternative that paints Amazon as &#8220;a Ponzi scheme doomed to collapse&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;completely ridiculous and utterly juvenile&#160;&#8212;&#160;I find any argument discussing the future of technology and computing ignoring Amazon&#8217;s place in that narrative lacking to the point of irrelevance. Rather than asking &#8220;what&#8221; Amazon is, we ought to ask &#8220;when&#8221; we will finally see Amazon realize the potential it has been building to all these years.</p>

<p>I hate to be &#8220;that guy&#8221; who takes to his website after a Twitter exchange goes south, but it seems I am becoming him more and more with each passing day. A few weeks ago after Zac Cichy and I disagreed on using mute filters to block uninteresting content, I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/in-defense-of-muting.html"><em>In Defense of Muting</em></a>; today, this article comes hot on the heels of a debate Glenn Fleishman and I almost had after he rejected an article Linus Edwards submitted to The Magazine as &#8220;too vague and too broad for [them] to consider.&#8221; I won&#8217;t rehash the entire conversation here, but if you so desire you may read it starting with <a href="https://twitter.com/LinusEdwards/status/434131381732769792">Linus&#8217;s tweet</a>. Rather, I took a break from House of Cards to talk a bit about good writing.</p>

<p>First of all, I have to start by pointing out that given my short eighteen years on this earth, I have absolutely no idea what I&#8217;m talking about. As Will Kohl so graciously pointed out in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/if1h23zqzzs5udg/I_have_no_idea_what_Im_talking_about_because_Im_only_18.png">a since-deleted tweet</a> I managed to preserve as an everlasting reminder of my inadequacy, it is simultaneously impossible and unfathomable that a whippersnapper so young and wet behind the ears as I could possibly possess any non-reductionist insight into the writer&#8217;s craft. Disregard the fact that some of history&#8217;s greatest writers produced their best work at remarkably young ages, ignore all the young poets who began their careers crafting prose during a particularly challenging childhood, and pay no attention to the fact that I am, in fact, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/colophon.html">nineteen</a>. None of those realities matter because age begets mastery, obviously, and a lack of the former invariably signals an absence of the latter. But I really couldn&#8217;t expect Mr. Kohl to take any of those factors into account anyways, because what&#8217;s the point in checking your facts after finding out that I&#8217;m just a kid? So with that self-evident truth mind, dear reader, please remember to take everything I say in this article with a massive grain of salt.</p>

<p>At the risk of embroiling the Twitter rage machine once more, I have no desire to call out bad writing even though&#160;&#8212;&#160;for reasons previously explained&#160;&#8212;&#160;I obviously know a thing or two about it. Instead, I want to spend some time talking about what makes for good writing. After that, I will leave you to form your own conclusions.</p>

<p>As I tried to articulate earlier on Twitter, good writing should serve as the jumping-off point for further discussion; it should be the article everyone reads and immediately feels the need to share with their friends because they loved it <em>that</em> much. Good writing is Patrick McKenzie&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"><em>Don&#8217;t Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice</em></a>, Shawn Blanc&#8217;s <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/"><em>Writing vs. Writing</em></a>, and Matt Gemmell&#8217;s <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/staying-afraid/"><em>Staying Afraid</em></a>; everyone shared those articles because it engendered within them a strong emotional or intellectual response, and in some cases both. Good writing is not a neatly-packaged pill to be consumed to no lasting effect, something with a formulaic beginning, middle, and ultimate conclusion wrapping everything up with a neat and tidy bow as you re-state your thesis. I was taught to write like that all throughout high school, and only now&#160;&#8212;&#160;in college&#160;&#8212;&#160;do I finally have an english teacher who hates this restrictive format as much as I.</p>

<p>One could make the argument that great writing is a combination of both the ability to elicit an emotional response and present a concise story arc in a single piece, like the just-released Endless Love did in telling a complete story while simultaneously fostering an incredible emotional reaction within me, but I would posit that writing exists on a scale with regards to its quality: while both aspects may present themselves in any given body of prose, one invariably outweighs the other in both importance and impact. In Endless Love, the emotional aspect dwarfed that of my desire to see a complete story unfold on the big screen. Color me a hopeless romantic and a sucker for chick flicks, but I <em>love</em> that movie; it is easily one of the best I have seen in a great while. It did not trump every movie in recent memory because I got to see a good introduction, steady progression, and a happy ending though, but because it took all that, pushed it to the side, and made way for the aspects that make for a <em>great</em> movie. Endless Love retained that all-too-pervasive structure, to a degree, but only insofar as it could while making way for the elements that went on to make it a truly spectacular film. That&#8217;s the mentality I&#8217;m fighting for when I call out formulaic writing as the blotch on civilized discourse that it is: I&#8217;m fighting for the ability that takes an acceptable work of prose to greatness, because without it what&#8217;s the point?</p>

<p>But then again, what do I know; I&#8217;m just an eighteen-year-old reductionist.</p>

<p>Over the last month every time I sat down to write, all throughout the editing process, and even after I finally washed my hands of an article and published it, I would think back to a curious analogy I happened upon a few weeks ago while writing a particularly long and challenging piece. As I wrestled to clearly and with great concision convey my thoughts in that since-forgotten post, I realized that writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;for all its apparent ease&#160;&#8212;&#160;is every bit as hard as the most intense of physical exercises. Obviously in a slightly different way, using another set of muscles, but just as difficult nonetheless.</p>

<p>In the world of weight lifting, the bench press is arguably the hardest exercise one can undertake with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/aspiration.html">free weights</a>, and resultant of this prestige one of the most popular as well. To its credit, this activity is also very simple: you load heavy plates onto either side of an approximately six-foot-long bar, lay beneath it, lift the bar off the rack, and then proceed to let it down and push it up for between eight and ten repetitions, or &#8220;reps&#8221;. Although relatively straightforward when taken at face value, &#8220;benching&#8221; becomes exponentially harder as the load bearing down on you grows. What&#8217;s more, as that pressure increases, so too does the challenge of performing this exercise well: throughout this process, you must also successfully navigate a number of critical points of failure in order to ensure not only your physical safety, but to retain the integrity of your workout too.</p>

<p>Prior to starting, preparing for the bench press invariably involves a certain number of fiddly steps prompted by a faint and often unacknowledged sense of uncertainty. Situate yourself on the bench just so, make sure to space your hands appropriately, loosen all the right muscles, roll your shoulders, and adjust your grip over and over again until, finally, you feel comfortable enough to start with a liftoff. Right before the bar leaves its rack though, that nervous feeling reaches a fever pitch seemingly in accordance with the upwards force you exert. Regardless of how often you may have succeeded at this before, there is no guarantee you will this time. In reality, it is actually quite likely that you will fail. Fortunately, by the time these misgivings peak, it&#8217;s too late to turn back.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the bench press, the liftoff predominantly makes use of your back and shoulders rather than a combination of those two muscle groups, your chest, and your arms as is the case during the majority of this exercise. Given the small subset of muscles required to lift the bar off its rack, this step often proves quite challenging. Once free of its constraint though, that iron-laden bar affords those beneath it a certain clarity of thought in revealing a simple, straightforward decision: either give up and re-rack the weight, or begin lowering it; assuming you opt for the latter, once started you will have no choice but to see the rep through. So you push and struggle and grunt and strain and wonder why you ever decided this was a good idea, until suddenly the rep is done and you find yourself back where you started: with a heavy bar suspended two feet above your chest by two increasingly weary, possibly even wobbly arms.</p>

<p>With a single rep under your belt, you have another difficult choice to make before your resolve fails: continue, or give up. You must always press on. Especially in the face of every incentive encouraging you otherwise, maintain your determination and continue. Between a respectable eight and ten repetitions later, only then can you in good conscience re-rack the bar and let a weary satisfaction set in for a precious few seconds before laying back down and doing it all over again. There is, however, one exception to this multi-rep requirement: when bench pressing your max&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, loading the bar with as many plates as you can possibly manage, and then trying your hardest to actually lift it; in this situation finishing more than one rep is not a sign of strength, but instead an indication that you did not load the bar with enough weight. If you truly set out to bench your max, you should struggle to successfully complete even one rep, with any more than that proving impossible. The frequency at which you undertake this incredibly strenuous form of lifting, then, ought to be inversely proportional to the effort required to complete it, and the same should go for normal reps as well. To use less convoluted terms, in order to grow stronger you ought to find yourself handling a manageable weight much more often than your max.</p>

<p>Contrary to what I may have alluded to up until now, you should not do any form of this exercise&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether lifting a lesser weight or struggling beneath your max&#160;&#8212;&#160;alone: anyone of any measurable intelligence bench presses with a spotter; in fact, many gyms require that you have one. In addition to ensuring your safety should you find yourself unable to completely re-rack the bar, thus facing the grim possibility of calling for help as one, two, or maybe even three hundred pounds crushes your chest or stomach, spotters fulfill the additional role of acting as a source of motivation. With a friend there to push you forward and past your own notional limits, you will grow much faster than otherwise possible.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>Out of all the arts writing has the broadest appeal, and arguably the highest barrier to mastery. Unlike music and dance, for example, both widely respected yet very subjective art forms, writing has much less room for artistic interpretation; more often than not, it gets taken at face value. Quite unfortunately, I might add, as many authors labor with the intention that their work will receive more than the cursory glance preluding ultimate dismissal. To further compound such challenges unique to craftsman of this trade, prose by definition suffers from a greater dosage of the author&#8217;s potentially polarizing opinions than is the case in other forms of artistic expression: you could hardly say something inflammatory in an orchestral number, after all, and a ballerina can only gesture so effectively. To its credit though, this task is also very simple: anywhere you can collect words, from a text editor to the back of a napkin, you can write, edit, and craft that jumbled mass to perfection. Although simple when considered from a high level, writing becomes much more complicated in accordance with the pressure to create good work. As that burden increases, the temptation to devolve into sensationalistic headlines above trite &#8220;articles&#8221; full of sentence-long paragraphs grows, all in service of reaching some misconstrued version of success. Throughout this process, then, you as an independent individual taking pride in your work must split your focus between crafting great prose and navigating the pitfalls many others fall prey to over the course of their literary careers. Only through this difficult balance can you ensure not just the quality of the end result, but your integrity as a writer as well.</p>

<p>Before you even start though, preparing to write almost always involves a certain number of fiddly steps prompted by a faint, often unacknowledged, and unshakable sense of uncertainty. Get your fancy chair situated, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/02/03/headphones-and-coffee">make some artisanal coffee, grab a pair of expensive headphones</a>, and launch your favorite distraction-free writing program. No matter how many times you may have done this in the past though, that nagging fear of failure never abates. In fact, the closer you get to actually beginning, the stronger these misgivings become until, coffee, headphones, and your text editor of choice at the ready, they have the ability to halt your creative process altogether.</p>

<p>Relative to the rest of the writing process, starting takes an inordinate amount of determination. Over the years countless articles, websites, and entire books have devoted themselves to helping writers overcome this difficult challenge, yet few have made significant progress in this area. Ultimately, it comes down to a simple question of willpower: is writing what you actually want to do right now? Truthfully answer that question, and you will take a huge step towards dispelling the mystery of writer&#8217;s block.</p>

<p>Once you gather the requisite determination to start and get that first draft or outline pounded out, the threat of an unfinished article hanging over you lends itself to a certain clarity of mind in revealing two distinct choices: give up or buckle down and finish writing; assuming you opt for the latter, as soon as you take a step in that direction you will have no choice but to see the project to its conclusion. So you push and struggle and grunt and strain and wonder why you ever decided this was a good idea, until suddenly the article is finished and you find yourself back where you started: with a sprawling mass of jumbled ideas all clamoring for your attention.</p>

<p>With one article under your belt, you have another difficult choice to handle before your resolve fails and you end up watching an episode of Downton Abbey: continue, or give up. You must continue. Especially when presented with every possible distraction, maintain your resolve and press onward. Ignore Twitter, the temptation to tweak your editor&#8217;s color scheme, and the position of that navigation bar; pursuing the &#8220;perfect&#8221; environment does not a good writer make. Rather&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this may come as a shock to some&#160;&#8212;&#160;actually devoting some time to this profession turns mediocre writers into good ones; it is only through this act that anyone can hope to reach any semblance of excellence in this field. So write often, and prolifically: perhaps even eight to ten <em>somethings</em> a day, where those could be anything from <a href="http://tabdump.com">paragraphs summarizing your favorite news stories</a> to a simple commentary on someone else&#8217;s work; yes, I&#8217;m talking about linkblogs. Because only after shouldering this burden over and over again, learning to deal with its effects, and fostering the skills to push past them can you ever hope to grow as a writer.</p>

<p>There is, however, one exception to this multi-<em>something</em> requirement: when writing a long form article&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, a sprawling diatribe born of your own interests rather than another&#8217;s; in this case finishing more than one piece every short while is more likely an indication that you could have devoted more time to polishing that first article than something to take pride in. If you truly set out to create great, original work, this goal will necessitate an effort of herculean proportions all throughout the process of creation and editing both. Attempting such a feat multiple times in the same day, then, ought to prove more than daunting, and in reality impossible. The frequency at which you undertake this very strenuous form of writing, then, should be inversely proportional to the effort necessary to complete it, and the same should go for shorter pieces as well. To put it simply, in order to grow as a writer you must strike the difficult balance between short articles of arguable importance such as those the linkblog format begets, and creating your own original content in lengthy posts such as this one.</p>

<p>Contrary to what I may have alluded to up until now, you should not go about the writing process alone: anyone of any measurable intelligence seeks feedback on their work either during the creation process or shortly after publishing. This feedback serves the dual purpose of ensuring literary excellence, and keeping the writer on topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;a tendency we as members of this profession have a propensity to eschew. With an accomplice there to prompt you towards better writing, you will undoubtedly grow much faster than if you decided not to care what anyone else thought of your work.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>As you grow stronger, bench pressing your max does not get easier. Although the difficulty of lifting one or two hundred pounds might, your max will&#160;&#8212;&#160;by definition&#160;&#8212;&#160;always hover at the very edge of your ability regardless of the hours you devote to this exercise. Yet some people become incredibly adept at it, and eventually possess the strength to hoist a literal ton above their chest and lift it just as you or I might a meager tenth of that weight. These individuals do not gain this impressive capacity because benching such incredible amounts magically gets easier after a year or two, but because time allows them to become better equipped at handling the crushing weight and resultant strain doing so inevitably entails. Similarly with regards to my hobby of choice, time alone does not a good writer make, just as pursuing the perfect environment will not further your abilities in this area even one iota. Rather, good writers are born of poor ones who stick around long enough to develop the same resilience fitness aficionados build through years of dedication and hard work. Authors must possess a deep understanding of lexicon, a strong grasp of the mechanics driving their chosen language, and the capacity to craft compelling narratives in order to produce acceptable prose. In order to create great work, however, that designation will only fall to those who engage in this task not only aware of its inherent difficulty, but confident in their capabilities to mitigate and overcome it as well.</p>

<p>When I started writing this, I opted for the title &#8220;Insanity&#8221; planning to draw a parallel between the tendency of weight lifters to continually return and attempt benching their max, and the writer&#8217;s tendency to willfully subject themselves to the crushing weight of an unfinished article. In each case, both repeatedly approach the same task in a similar way expecting a different result. And as <a href="http://www.news.hypercrit.net/2012/11/13/einstein-on-misattribution-i-probably-didnt-say-that/">a particularly astute individual</a> once said, that is the very definition of insanity. Maybe, then, these two traditionally divergent camps are not as dissimilar as we may have thought. Both come back time and time again expecting something different from the activities that served as such a pain point in the past, after all. Perhaps, but such a comparison belies a misunderstand of both processes: weight lifters grow stronger with each and every lift, just as writers get better with each and every article. And therein lies the secret to achieving excellence in either field.</p>

<p>Great look at the industry&#8217;s leading font providers, Hoefler &#38; Frere-Jones, Typekit, and Google Fonts, made all the more valuable because now I won&#8217;t have to shell out $150 to ultimately go back to Google Fonts in the end. In a sense, as light bulbs are to Marco Arment, so too are fonts to The Typist in this article. Also worth noting with regards to Google&#8217;s offering is that in addition to making an ever-expanding library of fonts available for the attractive price of free, the ubiquity of these fonts over the more expensive options from H&#38;FJ and Typekit makes caching and, thus, decreased load times something to consider as well.</p>

<p>Last week John Gruber updated his regular expression for matching URLs from a relatively modest 205 characters to just shy of two thousand. Given that I wrote my own Markdown parser for this site and thus spent quite a bit of time crafting regular expressions myself, his article immediately piqued my interest. Unlike John though, who wrote his to actually match URLs, mine assumes that everything formatted as a Markdown link is, in fact, a link of some fashion and deals with it accordingly. Thus, we approached the problem from two very different directions, and solved it in very different ways as a result. Perhaps in the future, if I ever take First Crack public, the ability to detect valid URLS could prove useful; however, until then, my solution works just fine, and I see absolutely no reason to change it.</p>

<p>Interesting article from Benedict Evans drawing parallels between the dynamics of today&#8217;s smartphone industry where device manufacturers have no idea what the next five years could hold for the platform they base their entire business upon, Android, and the days of WinTel&#8217;s dominance we are only just now beginning to see the decline of, where OEMs had concrete road maps upon which to build future devices to. This lack of stability could have served as one of the primary motivations behind Samsung agreeing to stop skinning Android: perhaps Google offered Android&#8217;s largest adopter an offer they just couldn&#8217;t pass up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t just complain that tech podcasts are boring, create your own tech podcast that you don&#8217;t find boring. Don&#8217;t just complain that most blogs are posting such boring echo chamber posts, post more interesting posts that explore new topics. That is what the great visionaries in history have done, fought the boredom and let it push them into areas that they didn&#8217;t find boring. That&#8217;s creativity, pushing the boundaries of what came before and creating new and interesting things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the last few months it seems everyone decided to take a break from making great things and instead spend their time complaining. First it was link blogs, at whose feet we could lay the blame for some perceived decline in intelligent discourse on the internet. After that, tech podcasts were too long, unfocused, and lacked polish. And then just recently the topic of discussion revolved around iOS games and in-app purchases, with the most recent example in Flappy Bird. There is room for this critique, to be sure: in most cases it is not only completely justifiable, but necessary in order to move forward as an industry and a community. However, complaining to the exclusion of innovating, when the former completely takes the place of the latter, certainly warrants some serious reconsideration of your priorities. It&#8217;s fine to say that you are dissatisfied with something, but don&#8217;t let that proclamation get in the way of creating something better.</p>

<p>Great piece from Ben Thompson on Satya Nadella&#8217;s recent ascension to power over at Microsoft. Although I have not followed this saga closely&#160;&#8212;&#160;a fancy way of saying that I just don&#8217;t care&#160;&#8212;&#160;I found Ben&#8217;s thoughts on the topic, as usual, very interesting. Perhaps one day we will look back on this day as the turning point after which Microsoft started an upwards trend of relevance, profitability, and innovation. Perhaps, but I&#8217;m not getting my hopes up.</p>

<p>Stefan Constantinescu has some very interesting ideas regarding Apple&#8217;s future plans for its mobile phone line with the launch of the iPhone 6 this fall. I wrote about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/its-a-crapshoot.html">my thoughts on the topic</a> a couple weeks ago, but the possibility of an iPhone 6C built according to the new form factor of the 6 with 5S internals did not occur to me. Very interesting, both this idea and his reasoning behind the imminence of a larger iPhone, and his justification for the form factor he ultimately puts forth as most likely in the coming year. Well worth the read.</p>

<p>A few days ago I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/algorithmic-ineptitude.html"><em>Algorithmic Ineptitude</em></a>, where I took Hacker News, Digg, and Reddit to task for recommending articles based on flawed algorithms rather than employing humans to perform the same task in a much better way. That same day I found a post by Alex Turnbull of Groove talking about his team&#8217;s efforts to game Hacker News. Although his well-researched, reasonable methodology ultimately failed, its existence highlights a huge shortcoming in this service to actually bring good content to the attention of its users, and I highly doubt Hacker News is the only site creators have gamed in exchange for pageviews and thus increased revenue.</p>

<p>Right on the heels of its quarterly earnings call, after an 8% drop in price, Apple shelled out $14,000,000,000 in continuation the buyback program it started <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/19Apple-Announces-Plans-to-Initiate-Dividend-and-Share-Repurchase-Program.html">in 2012</a>. Contrary to 9to5mac&#8217;s report, I have a hard time believing Tim Cook was at all surprised by this drop; rather, a much more likely scenario would have found him counting on such a devaluation regardless of what he said, did, or otherwise announced during the earnings call. What better time to conduct a large buyback program than at nearly 10% off? If anything, it may have surprised him that it did not fall farther. <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/02/06/apple-buys-back-14-billion-in-stock/">As Jim Dalrymple said</a>, &#8220;Apple is being very strategic with every move it makes.&#8221; I completely agree.</p>

<p>A few days ago my girlfriend told me about the &#8220;lunk alarm&#8221;, a gimmick Planet Fitness uses to make its facilities more attractive to those who rarely go to the gym. Marketed as a judgment-free workout zone, Planet Fitness sets this alarm off whenever a patron makes too much noise during their workout; upon repeat transgressions, the gym&#8217;s managers will ask these people to leave in order to foster a less intimidating atmosphere&#160;&#8212;&#160;or so the reasoning goes. When she explained this to me I managed to meter my incredulity, but only just so.</p>

<p>The gym I go to has six rooms: a basketball court, an elliptical room, a racquetball court, a room for free weights, one for group exercise, and a resistance training area. For the unindoctrinated, dumbbells and bench presses are free weights, whereas the equipment featuring cables and pulleys lifting stacks of weights vertically fall into the category of resistance training machines. Generally, aspirational gym-goers start with the latter and then work their way up to the former. Thus, Planet Fitness, resultant of their goal to cater to the greatest common denominator, carries many more resistance training machines than free weights, and penalizes anyone who comes to their gym in search of a serious, strenuous workout. One could certainly make the case both for and against this practice or their advocation of <a href="http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/free_weights.html">resistance training over free weights</a>, but that is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>When I started going to the gym about four years ago, I stayed in the resistance training room for the better part of a year because I felt I was not yet strong enough to go out and lift free weights. I didn&#8217;t avoid free weights because I felt intimidated by those who worked out in that room. In fact, the guys out there were some of the nicest I have ever met, and much nicer than those who frequented the other areas of the gym. When I finally worked my way up to curls and bench presses, they often gave me helpful advice that led to both a better workout for me and kept me from hurting myself in the process. The most important thing I got from them, though, they gave me without even knowing it every day I walked into that gym: aspiration.</p>

<p>Every day I came to the gym, walked past the free weights, and saw someone pushing some seven hundred pounds on the leg press, or another with my body weight on each side of the bench press, or still another with a fifty pound dumbbell attached to his waist to make pull-ups harder&#160;&#8212;&#160;seeing that gave me a goal to work towards; watching someone lifting so, <em>so</em> much gave me the extra push I needed to bump my own weights up an extra ten or fifteen pounds in pursuit of him. I knew it would take a long time to get there, but I had a goal to work towards and so I did: I worked and worked and, eventually, began lifting a respectable amount. I would have never reached that point without those &#8220;lunk heads&#8221; though, and so for their influence on my fitness I am very thankful.</p>

<p>In the context of this blog and the readers this will reach, following other successful writers gives me something to work towards; it helps stay the slip into mediocrity I would have undoubtedly reached had everyone else at my gym been just as fit as I. Just as an aspiring writer would never surround himself with similarly-skilled individuals and still hope to improve his ability to craft words into compelling narratives, it would be equally ridiculous to surround yourself with individuals of equal fitness levels and expect to make any significant progress. You must have a catalyst pushing you further than your comfort zone would traditionally allow, for only through the pursuit of that hard and fast goal will you have any hope of achieving greatness in any aspect of your life.</p>

<p>When I sat down to write this yesterday afternoon, two of the top five articles on Hacker News were not actually articles at all: the first pointed to a Microsoft page extolling the virtues of their new CEO Satya Nadella, below which the fifth &#8220;story&#8221; linked to Firefox 27&#8217;s release notes. In no universe would any person categorize either of these pages as something that &#8220;gratifies one&#8217;s intellectual curiosity.&#8221; In fact, I would say we can look forward to watching the former appear &#8220;on TV news&#8221; ad nauseam in the coming days and, perhaps, weeks as well. Nevertheless, both climbed out of obscurity and to the front page of this popular site despite violating the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">Hacker News submission guidelines</a> not because someone decided Satya needed more publicity, or that Mozilla releasing the twenty-seventh iteration of the new Internet Explorer was in any way noteworthy, but because an algorithm put them there.</p>

<p>Once an article gets submitted to Hacker News, it goes to the &#8220;New&#8221; page where everything either fades to obscurity after as little as half an hour or gains popularity in the form of upvotes, comments, and clicks until eventually reaching the venerable front page. We may deduce this third criterion, clicks, by looking at Patrick McKenzie&#8217;s article <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing"><em>Don&#8217;t End The Week With Nothing</em></a> and comparing it to another, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2014/feb/04/method-so-acceptable-dea-cant-even-tell-you-its-na/">&#8220;DEA redacts tactic that&#8217;s more secret than parallel construction&#8221;</a>: whereas the former came in at #2 with 99 points (upvotes) and 26 comments, the latter, despite ranking higher at #3, had 149 points and 54 comments. This seemingly off-kilter disparity has but one explanation: points and comments are not the only metric Hacker News uses to determine the rankings of its stories; even here, pageviews are king.</p>

<p>By engaging in this brief thought exercise, we are able to explain why websites antithetical to Hacker News&#8217;s professed target genres nevertheless go on to gain such popularity: users ignorant of the site&#8217;s guidelines submit such links, and then curious readers click them. As these items gain momentum and start climbing up the ranking ladder sheerly by virtue of their traffic, an unfortunate happenstance occurs by which readers, feeling in some way positively disposed towards Microsoft&#8217;s latest announcement, upvote the links in question and begin compounding the problem. When it peaks, this perfect storm leads to Microsoft&#8217;s latest CEO with his company profile on the front page of a high-traffic internet fire hose. Admittedly, this case is the exception rather than the rule: more often than not an actual article, something that truly deserves to be ranked #1 on Hacker News, occupies that spot; however, this sort of mishap happens often enough to prove that the current system by which links rise to fame is, quite frankly, broken.</p>

<p>Having knocked Hacker News down a few pegs on the notional &#8220;greatest site on the internet&#8221; chart and successfully removed some of the mystique surrounding the service in the process, let&#8217;s shift our focus to other, similar websites and take a critical look at them as well.</p>

<p>In many ways, Digg is very similar to Hacker News. In fact, remove the latter&#8217;s &#8220;New&#8221; page where submissions get a brief period of heightened discoverability, change the layout and color scheme a bit, and you have Digg. The site accepts user submissions, and then ranks the most popular articles on its front page according to Digg votes, Twitter links, and Facebook shares, according to <a href="http://digg.com/faq">the Digg FAQ</a>. Similarly, Reddit also takes articles and stories submitted by its users and through a combination of upvotes and comments ranks them on the Reddit home page. Like Hacker News, both also put great stock in page views. For proof just look at the Reddit front page, where a story with just 131 comments and 2810 upvotes comes in ahead of another with 2444 comments and 3411 upvotes. A similar process of deduction can be applied to Digg&#8217;s homepage. On these sites as well, pageviews remain king.</p>

<p>At this point it&#8217;s worth noting that the only metric I have not discussed yet is time since submission. Each of the aforementioned portals tacks this number on to every story, so it stands to reason that this measure could also, in some way, affect rankings. However, with the same steps we used to find the elusive third criterion for popularity, we can also deduce that time since submission does not influence ranking directly. Indirectly these links obviously benefit from greater exposure and thus potentially more upvotes, comments, and clicks, but this number does not appear to play a role in rankings beyond that.</p>

<p>So we have three services with the same general purpose, going about it with roughly the same process. What makes Reddit a place for memes, Digg one geared towards primarily original work, and Hacker News the catch-all for anything remotely related to technology? Readerships. 2013 saw Reddit rack up approximately 60,916,667 pageviews a month, according to <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2013/12/top-posts-of-2013-stats-and-snoo-years.html">this year-in-review blog post</a>. Although stats for Digg proved much harder to come by, even if I were to use numbers taken from peak popularity in January of 2012, when it attracted some <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428520/why-did-reddit-succeed-where-digg-failed/">29.1 million monthly pageviews</a>, Reddit&#8217;s incredible volume would still dwarf Digg&#8217;s relatively mediocre performance. Given its past success though, one might be tempted to place it just below Reddit on this three-site continuum; however, to do so would be to discount the significant traffic Hacker News receives every day.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">a TechCrunch article</a> from May of last year, Hacker News sees around 1.6 million pageviews every weekday. That number would only increase on weekends, but for simplicity&#8217;s sake assume it stayed the same; extrapolating to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5620197/no-kidding-what-is-the-average-amount-of-days-in-a-month">a full month</a>, that means between forty-eight and forty-nine million pageviews over the same time period Digg, in its heyday as one of the largest, most popular websites on the internet, managed a &#8220;mere&#8221; twenty-nine million. Especially when considering Digg&#8217;s fall from grace over the last few years, even in light of its recent resurgence under Betaworks, and the fact that Hacker News has undoubtedly grown in the last year, this puts Digg in third place with Hacker News between it and Reddit.</p>

<p>These vast, mostly self-selecting readerships influence the types of content each site serves through the very methods that bring one post to fame while leaving another to wallow in obscurity. If Reddit has the greatest gross input based purely on raw numbers though, with Hacker News coming in second and Digg at the bottom, why does the quality of content each platform puts forth appear inversely proportional to the service&#8217;s rankings? It would stand to reason that a site as large as Reddit would benefit from the hive mind culling uninteresting and otherwise worthless work from its ranks, to put forth nothing but the best on its front page. Yet Reddit has become a place for memes, and Digg&#160;&#8212;&#160;with its significantly smaller readership&#160;&#8212;&#160;the place for interesting work. In order to answer that question we must dip briefly into the semantics of the English language, because the answer is, on one level, &#8220;audience&#8221;.</p>

<p>Reddit caters&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this is a very import turn of phrase&#160;&#8212;&#160;to the greatest common denominator of the internet with sensational headlines, semi-humorous memes, fail videos, and short articles generally of little substance. These are the media forms most internet users prefer, and so&#160;&#8212;&#160;with a huge number of normal internet users driving the content Reddit showcases&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is exactly what appears on Reddit.</p>

<p>Hacker News, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">as Leena Rao explains in the aforementioned TechCrunch piece</a>, is a community created for and populated by &#8220;ex-Redditors&#8221; yearning for the good old days when most of Reddit&#8217;s users counted themselves amongst the ranks of hackers and innovators. Thus, Hacker News is a result of&#160;&#8212;&#160;again, an important distinction to compare with the way I defined Reddit above and will define Digg below&#160;&#8212;&#160;the greatest common denominator of the tech industry. To grossly oversimplify this comparison, you could think of Hacker News as r/technology in which only those familiar with or those who consider themselves familiar with technology can participate; a self-selecting subreddit devoted solely to technology and its surrounding industries. As such, Hacker News possesses both the good qualities of Reddit&#8217;s approach to promoting &#8220;interesting&#8221; articles, for a fair number of the links that make it to Hacker News are in some way interesting, and the bad as well, as evidenced by Microsoft&#8217;s prominence in the #1 spot despite contributing nothing to the surrounding narrative on the future of technology.</p>

<p>Digg, on the other hand, <em>showcases</em><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the greatest common denominator in popular content, just as Reddit does, except Digg tempers these recommendations with a human element: they cull rankings from Twitter and Facebook as well as user interactions on the site, and use &#8220;moderators&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;an ugly word they should have replaced with &#8220;editors&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;to ensure that only quality work reaches the Digg front page. That human element is key, the single most important factor in curating good content.</p>

<p>Take Stefan Constantinescu&#8217;s <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/2/4/february-04-57-tabs">new</a> <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/2/5/february-05-52-tabs">series</a> in which he collects his favorite articles from the past day in a lengthy list of succinct summarizations, for example: this epitomizes exactly what I wish Hacker News would provide. Namely, great content aligned with my stated interests that I will not find any bloggers I follow talking about. Or consider <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/newsletter/">Scott Hanselman&#8217;s Newsletter of Wonderful Things</a>, Brett Terstra&#8217;s <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/topic/bookmarks/">Web Excursions</a>, or <a href="http://eepurl.com/MdDeX">my own newsletter</a>: each features hand-picked websites and links our subscribers can rest assured will fall within a certain realm of interest to them by virtue of the fact that we felt they were in some way noteworthy, and they agreed with our views enough to subscribe in the first place. This is the deficiency big-name curation sites suffer from: a lack of humanity to say that Satya Nadella&#8217;s corporate profile has no place on the front page of Hacker News, even if an algorithm says otherwise.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;To recap, Reddit caters to the greatest common denominator, Hacker News is a result of the greatest common denominator, and Digg showcases the greatest common denominator.</p>

<p>I completely agree with Sid here: the growth of the internet as a widely-accepted medium through which to publish one&#8217;s thoughts and opinions as was once handled exclusively through corporate newspaporial publications with batteries of editors at their disposal has led to a net decline in literary quality over the last few years. The popularity of the link blog certainly did not help, perhaps it even compounded the already steady march, but to lay all the blame at John Gruber et al.&#8217;s feet would be to erroneously attribute them with an inevitable decline facilitated by lowering a barrier to entry much higher in the internet&#8217;s earlier years than it is today. So spend just a bit more time editing: your readers will appreciate it, you will take greater pride in your work, and you just might make Sid&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>Back in January Linus Edwards started &#8220;The Podcasters&#8221;, a series of articles in which he interviews podcast producers from all walks of life around the world. Beginning with Ben Alexander of <a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm">Fiat Lux</a>, continuing with <a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a> and&#160;&#8212;&#160;more recently&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://www.lifeandcodeandstuff.com">Life and Code and Stuff&#8217;s</a> Andrew Clark, Linus just posted the third installment wherein he spoke with Slovenian podcaster Anze Tomic about the shows he does on <a href="http://apparatus.si">Apparatus</a>. If you glossed over these interviews when Linus started posting them, I encourage you to given them a chance: <a href="http://vintagezen.com/2014/1/19/the-podcasters-1">Ben</a> and <a href="http://vintagezen.com/2014/1/27/the-podcasters-2">Andrew</a> both had very interesting and tenuously-related answers to Linus&#8217;s last question, &#8220;Would you like to change anything about your current podcasting setup?&#8221;, and <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/2/3/the-podcasters-3">Anze&#8217;s</a> setup and his thoughts on equipment alone make the short interview worth reading.</p>

<p>A few days ago Stefan Constantinescu of <a href="http://tabdump.com/">Tab Dump</a> wrote an article titled <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/1/22/making-some-bets"><em>Making Some Bets</em></a>, where he announced his decision to go fully independent and rely on his writing to support himself.

The broad range of topics he covers makes for very interesting reading and highlights great articles I would never have found otherwise, but I could get that from any old news reader. Rather, it is the unique format and accompanying succinct summarizations that I find so compelling about Stefan&#8217;s new daily venture, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt that he includes enough articles to keep me set for a day or two, at least, with each installment. I really like this new thing Stefan decided to do, and I think you will too. Definitely go check it out.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/kentucky-senate.html">Computer Programming as a Foreign Language</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-02-03 16:41:47-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-02.html">02</a>/03 16:41:47 EST</time>
<p>Just last week the Kentucky Senate passed a bill by which computer programming classes would count towards a student&#8217;s foreign language requirement in high school. Although at first I wanted to see this as a boon for teenagers who would now have the ability to enter college or the workforce better technologically prepared, just as the bill&#8217;s proponents and Jim Dalrymple, <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/02/03/kentucky-senate-passes-bill-to-let-computer-programming-satisfy-foreign-language-requirement/">who originally linked to this piece</a> do, I&#8217;m not entirely sure this is a good thing after all.</p>

<p>Public schools have almost universally terrible programming courses, a claim I can confidently base on both anecdotal evidence from friends who have taken these types of classes in the past and from seeing the code former students write immediately after graduation. With the exception of one person, I have never heard anyone speak highly of their programming experience in a public high school. Even before becoming proficient at this task, most realized how far this offering came from covering anything but the most rudimentary of basics. Worse, though, because for some any introduction&#160;&#8212;&#160;no matter how shallow&#160;&#8212;&#160;could prove sufficiently interesting to merit further exploration outside of school, the aforementioned friend&#8217;s teacher taught him to use HTML tags deprecated fourteen years ago (this was just last year, fifteen years ago as of this writing) and nothing about modern web technologies and frameworks. Perhaps other schools have better programs, but if this institution failed to properly educate its students in such a basic skill as web programming, how much faith should anyone have in its ability to teach more complex languages and concepts necessary to vie for competitive positions after school? If he still used &lt;center /&gt; tags to position his content, what does that say for his knowledge of C?</p>

<p>And then, as if masquerading as a way in which to gain valuable technical was not enough, this new workaround will&#160;&#8212;&#160;if voted into law&#160;&#8212;&#160;deprive innumerable children of the ability to understand another language besides English. To this critique many will undoubtedly object saying that they have not used their chosen foreign language since graduating high school, but that completely misses the point: just because you never put enough effort into learning Spanish for the requisite two years between the age of sixteen and eighteen to get anything out of it does not mean that there is no value in exposing yourself to another culture through the study of its language. Perhaps if you had applied yourself, you could have taken that study abroad trip to Spain during college, and who knows what formative life experiences you could have had there. Or maybe if you had learned French, for instance, you would have later gone on to visit the Eiffel Tower; maybe you would have pursued a career as a mime. Had you instead learned German, you might have spent sixteen days drunk in Munich at Oktoberfest. I can&#8217;t think of a single college student who wouldn&#8217;t love that. All joking aside though, the point stands: there is so much more to learning a foreign language than merely having the ability to say &#8220;Hello&#8221; in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Over the last five years or so, I have studied Latin, Spanish, and Chinese for two, one, and closing in on three years now, respectively. Although I cannot remember everything I learned about Latin, I do remember some things, and those frequently come in handy when writing. Similarly with Spanish, I don&#8217;t remember everything I learned in the short period of time I was taught it. I do, however, recall bits and pieces here and there, and there is no doubt in my mind that I am better for it and for the greater knowledge of this ethnicity that study fostered. Chinese, on the other hand, remains a work in progress, and as such I learn more of the language as each week goes by. Just as interesting to me as the language, though, is the fascinating culture so different than the one I am used to here in the middle of the United States. It&#8217;s absolutely fascinating, and something that I plan to experience firsthand in the very near future with a few years of practice mastering the language under my belt.</p>

<p>These are experiences and skills kids who choose to study C in school will never have. At seventeen I&#8217;m sure I would have chosen C over Chinese given the choice, and so while I cannot fault the kids who take this route for choosing so, that does not mean I will not feel sorry for them.</p>

<p>Around minute 44:33 of Cube&#8217;s latest episode, Ben Bajarin theorized that Google&#8217;s motivation in selling Motorola to Lenovo while Samsung simultaneously agreed to scale back their customization of Android could have come about as a result of Samsung desiring access to a concrete feature road map which they could build to in the future. In my last article, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/retroactively-planning.html"><em>Retroactively Planning</em></a>, I talked about how Samsung&#8217;s backwards strategy in which rather than approaching future product creation with a long-held guiding philosophy they must now scramble to infer one from existing successful products is ultimately doomed to failure. Ben&#8217;s theory fits nicely into this picture as a move Samsung could be taking in an attempt at having greater control over their destiny. However, without an underlying theory guiding the decisions they say yes and no to throughout the creation process, I stand by my original idea: I feel this newfound knowledge will change little with regards to Samsung&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>Upon reaching a goal you cannot look back on the journey in search of the process that led you to success; you will invariably romanticize the past, shedding mediocre choices in a complimentary light, discounting difficult challenges, and misremembering strokes of genius in situations where there was none. In short, this exercise will ultimately only ensure that you never replicate any form of that success again. Rather than flying by the seat of your pants and relying on a postmortem to delineate good steps from bad, a much better approach would advocate starting with a solid and detailed plan, a well thought-out course of action, for you cannot go from the other way around and reasonably hope to make even mediocre achievements.</p>

<p>I think this a relatively straightforward and sensible insight, so let us put it into perspective with regards to Apple, Google, and Samsung, keeping in mind all the while that rather than a comparison in which we find one winner and two losers, this is merely an examination of their different approaches and the value of each.</p>

<p>Apple started out of a garage in California with the goal of making computing more accessible. Famously, everyone at that time could build their own computer, but not everyone wanted to. This philosophy underwent a distillation process over the years, becoming the more salient mantra of &#8220;build great products&#8221; Tim Cook extols on a regular basis, and did so once again in the most recent earnings call. This informs their every decision, and guides them in the process of creating incredible products. To say that it has served Apple well over the years by allowing the company to become one of the most valued corporations in the world, then, would be a slight understatement, to say the least.</p>

<p>Google set out with a similarly noble goal, although it has become somewhat convoluted as of late. What began as the simple mission statement &#8220;index the world&#8221; later grew with the amendment of &#8220;through targeted advertising&#8221; when co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin realized that search alone did not make for a sustainable business. At some point early on in Google&#8217;s history that mantra, although not to my knowledge ever explicitly stated, became internalized and replaced with the public-facing and highly-ambiguous &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; we have to this day. Internally, however, the driving force behind Google&#8217;s actions has continued to change: the latter motivation usurped the former as Google&#8217;s most important goal, and as such up until recently everything Google has done has been in service of providing better ads. That&#8217;s not to say that their focus has completely shifted from indexing the world, but that when simplified and taken as a two-tier priority system unparalleled search became second to building out the necessary capabilities to serve targeted advertising. Their former number one priority remains, for ads without a compelling platform are completely worthless, but Google now<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> actively works to improve advertising first and search second. Regardless of Google&#8217;s motivations though, Larry and Sergey&#8217;s original approach has served their company well: what began as a Stanford research project has grown into one of the largest internet companies in existence.</p>

<p>Samsung, in contrast to both Apple and Google, started from the other end: they had a phone design numerous court proceedings have proven came directly from or at least was heavily influenced by Apple&#8217;s iPhone, and an operating system from Google; combining the two, they began raking in cash captured from the low-end and mid-range smartphone markets. Outside of supply chain, manufacturing, and user interface skinning&#160;&#8212;&#160;everything but the actual product&#160;&#8212;&#160;Samsung has managed almost no innovation to get where they currently reside at the head of the Android market, choosing instead to capitalize on the efforts of others. This worked for them, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2014/01/06/samsungs-4q-profit-falls-6-percent">up to a point</a>: mid-range and down Android phones are approaching saturation though, and these users have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-slow-fade.html">no where to go but up from here</a>. Although some will continue buying Android-based Samsung-made smartphones, the company cannot count on user loyalty to continue driving growth. If anything, under its current strategy, Samsung will only continue losing users as its existing install base flees upmarket, using Samsung&#8217;s less expensive devices as gateway drugs to the high-end smartphone world. In order to bring future growth back on track, Samsung must look to other market sectors in which to replicate the explosive success of their mobile handset business. Unfortunately, they have nothing to replicate but results: with no process&#160;&#8212;&#160;they built (and I use the term loosely here) off of others&#8217; work to achieve their first wave of success&#160;&#8212;&#160;they have no recourse but to make an attempt at inferring a viable process from existing results. And as we established earlier, that&#8217;s an exercise ultimately doomed to failure.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-02-02 20:00:28-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-02.html">02</a>/02 20:00:28 EST</time>
<p>A few more of my favorite cabins alongside some great articles on related topics and stories. If you have any interest in checking out my previous collections, start <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup.html">here</a> at the beginning, then continue with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-1113.html">November</a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-1213.html">December&#8217;s</a> lists. If not, read on.</p>

<p>I collect these links and order them chronologically as I come across them, so today we&#8217;re starting off with an article from Huckberry titled <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/trail-life"><em>Trail Life</em></a>. <em>Trail Life</em> tells the story of one man&#8217;s journey along the entire Appalachian trail, and details his interesting introspective throughout. Amazing. I have hiked a small portion of this trail before, but nowhere near as far as Liam Cremins did. Perhaps someday.</p>

<p>Next in line, a sad story from the Los Angeles Times: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-c1-jack-english-20131227-dto,1674529,294316.htmlstory"><em>At 94, mountain man must gradually let go of his piece of paradise</em></a>. The title says it all, really: seventy-seven years after moving to this remote plot in the mountains of California, Jack English has no choice but to leave the home he made with his now-deceased wife. Incredibly sad.</p>

<p>And on that rather depressing note, Chris Gonzales wrote about <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/lodges-pre-seasoned-cast-iron-skillets/">Lodge&#8217;s Pre-seasoned Cast Iron Skillets</a> for Tools &#38; Toys a few weeks ago. Every kitchen should have at least one of these, no camping trip would be complete&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even doable&#160;&#8212;&#160;without one, and every cabin ought to have nothing but these in the cupboards. If I had to choose between cast iron and stainless steel, I would cook everything in a cast iron pot or pan. With the exception of boiling water, everything both cooks and tastes better when made in one of these. Careful when cleaning it, though: you cannot&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I can&#8217;t stress this enough&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>cannot</em> clean it like a normal cooking pot, lest you destroy its valuable patine. In my opinion, the process is much simple with cast iron, but decide for yourself: theKitchn has <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-clean-a-cast-iron-skill-107747">a great guide</a> complete with pictures and everything.</p>

<p>Finally on to actual cabins, our first comes from <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/72117745263/cabin-at-lake-louise-in-banff-national-park">Banff National Park in Canada</a>. Unsurprisingly buried in snow and surrounded with trees, you get the added bonus of a mountain looming just out your back door. I would love to spend a weekend here, regardless of season.</p>

<p>Shifting focus back to Huckberry, Mathew Kline talks about his trip to the last great nomadic horse culture on earth in <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/a-mongolian-nomad"><em>A Mongolian Nomad</em></a>. I can only imagine what it was like to take such a trip. His recount and the scenery reminded me of the three months I spent in South Africa two years ago. It&#8217;s hard to believe it has been so long.</p>

<p>On the topic of trips, Lonely Plant posted a list of <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/switzerland/travel-tips-and-articles/76228">the 10 best treks in the world</a>.</p>

<p>And then back to Cabin Porn for the last time, we have this log cabin from <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/72910121026/log-cabin-in-warrensburg-ny-photo-by-katie">Warrensburg, New York</a>. How cool. Unlike most of the cabins I see and post on here, this one actually looks capable of comfortably housing more than a couple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Built to provide shelter for the people who did the measuring of the annual snow pack. If, when they arrived, the snow was above the door, they could climb the ladder on the outside of the steeple and enter through the small door.&#8221; I can only imagine what it was like to trudge through snow high enough to use <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/73414630377/snow-cabin-near-the-top-of-the-rogue-umpqua">this snow cabin&#8217;s</a> upper door. Incredible.</p>

<p>Another structure erected in Oregon, this time for the exact opposite purpose, it would be pretty cool to spend an afternoon eating lunch on top of <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/73553012302/clear-lake-butte-lookout-near-mt-hood-oregon">that lookout tower</a>. What a view they must get.</p>

<p>Coming from across the world in Linescio, Switzerland, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/74193222858/200-year-old-stacked-stone-home-in-linescio">a home built of stacked rock</a> some 200 years ago got renovated in 2011 with an uncompromising and curiously attractive minimalist aesthetic. Very cool.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/74416344383/tiny-cabin-in-woodstock-new-york-contributed-by">a tiny cabin in Woodstock, New York</a>. Right after that stacked stone cabin in Switzerland, I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at this one&#8217;s apparent attempt at mimicking it. Good try, little buddy.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/74490268920/lakeside-log-cabin-in-newfoundland-writes">one more log cabin</a>, this time in Newfoundland. From Cabin Porn&#8217;s description: &#8220;My dad built this himself. We call it &#8216;The Great Escape&#8217;; just 20 mins from home (Corner Brook, Newfoundland), on a lake all on its own.&#8221; A great escape indeed.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-31 09:40:20-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/31 09:40:20 EST</time>
<p>After buying my first Mac a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html">few</a> months <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/testing-the-apple-tax.html">ago</a>, I soon grew quite fond of it as the most powerful computer I have owned to date. It zips through every task I can think to throw at it, and I can spend an entire day working without needing an outlet. Even better, it takes up so little space and ads such insignificant weight to my backpack that I regularly reach behind me just to make sure I didn&#8217;t forget it somewhere. My 15" Retina MacBook Pro not only outclasses every one of my previous computers in raw processing power, I can confidently say that this device is the best I have ever owned. And then to sweeten the deal, Mavericks puts my past operating systems to shame. Especially coming from the current Windows world undergoing a forced devolution to Windows 8, I did not realize how relieved I would feel back in the traditional desktop computing paradigm ironically only present in OS X these days.</p>

<p>Despite all its high points though, I do have some issues with this computer and the underlying operating system. In fact, I can think of quite a few extremely pedantic critiques concerning everything ranging from the way the power button works to how Apple&#8217;s Dictionary app displays antonyms. These built up inside me over the last few months to a fever pitch until I could not stand it any longer, and so I decided to write about them. Fair warning, though: when I say &#8220;extremely pedantic&#8221;, I mean that in the truest sense of the phrase. The vast majority of the issues I will raise here likely only bother me and as such I do not mean to say that Apple ought to fix any or even some of them. Rather, consider this my utilization of a socially acceptable means through which to vent about a few minor annoyances in an otherwise splendid user experience.</p>

<p>Every time I approach my computer, I reach for the one opening in the MacBook&#8217;s uniform bezel to pry screen from keyboard and begin work. Sometimes, I wish I had the option of opening my laptop from more than the one area closest to me. Unfortunately, the device&#8217;s inhbitingly thin seam makes this all but impossible.</p>

<p>Before I even open the lid though, I have to decide which way to position my computer. Obviously, one of the long sides faces me; but which one? The only telling mark on the entire computer, save the ports I refuse to turn my computer sideways to examine every time I want to use it, is the Apple logo which regularly does absolutely nothing for me. I&#8217;m getting better at this, but hey&#160;&#8212;&#160;what about an inlay all the way across the front rather than a paltry inch-long strip directly below the trackpad? Seems logical, and it would solve both this and my previous issue in one fell swoop. Not to say that Apple should do this, though, because that&#8217;s not the purpose of this article: I&#8217;m just commiserating on a few grievances that have become more akin to festering wounds as of late.</p>

<p>Speaking of annoyances&#160;&#8212;&#160;talk about a segue, right? I doubt you saw that one coming&#160;&#8212;&#160;I really dislike how the charging cable&#8217;s indicator light defaults to green when first plugged in before invariably turning orange a few seconds later. It would make much more sense if it immediately lit up orange instead, because no matter how long my computer has run off its battery it will have lost some charge. If, after a few seconds, it changes from orange to green, fine: although my battery meter may read 100% after ten minutes in a coffee shop, I know it no longer has a full charge. Don&#8217;t try to fool me into thinking otherwise, no matter how briefly.</p>

<p>On the topic of peripherals and the wires connecting them, Apple has a habit of making cables that give off the impression of durability, yet fail after a relatively short period of time and normal use. That&#8217;s not even the problem I have with them, though; I don&#8217;t expect my charging cable to last more than a year or two. Rather, I hate how every one of Apple&#8217;s cords retain whatever shape I happen to contort them into for a frustratingly long period of time.</p>

<p>Back when I had an iPod Nano and then, later, an iPod Touch, I wrapped my headphones around the device before stowing it in my pocket. Over time that imbued the cable with an irreversible bend at each point it curved around the side of my iPod, so I took to wrapping my headphones in as large a loop as humanly possible before slipping them into my pocket. This way, when I pull them out I won&#8217;t have to deal with coils, knots, or curious twists and turns no amount of adjusting will ever remove. Apple&#8217;s computer charging cable, atop those strange little clips, shares the same problem: every time I unravel it beyond the usual six inches I use when at home, I must first massage the cable into a relatively straight line lest the coils tug too hard on the frustratingly weak MagSafe adapter and prevent my computer from charging at all. Or take my 30-pin dock connector connectors, for example: mine all have a permanent curvature because they sat bowed like that for an extended period of time. Now, no matter how I use them, they always revert to that shape.</p>

<p>I would love to see Apple improve their cables. If they could make them last longer at the same time, great; if not, how about starting with the squiggly headphone cables? The likelihood of catching a headphone increases exponentially with the squiggly-ness of its cable, after all, and we most certainly <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/statuses/251124561393893378">do not want that</a>. As with everything in this article, I could choose not to care, as most will do. But you know what? It would be nice if I didn&#8217;t have to make that decision at all.</p>

<p>Okay, suppose I managed to charge my computer, plug in a pair of headphones, and get the lid open&#160;&#8212;&#160;a veritable feat in and of itself. Before I can do anything with the computer, it has to wake up first. Most of the time that takes a few seconds, tops, but occasionally I find myself wondering why my laptop won&#8217;t turn on, only to have it awaken as if a reluctant teenager getting out of bed in the morning. I know what Apple is going for here&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;ve heard the story of Steve Jobs walking into a planning meeting for the MacBooks, unlocking an iPad, asking why the Macs didn&#8217;t work that fast, and walking out&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the MacBooks still have yet to reach that point. They may be close, I must admit, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as the saying goes&#160;&#8212;&#160;close only counts in bombs and hand grenades.</p>

<p>Now, with my computer awake, I have to deal with the keyboard. Most of the time, I really enjoy this: it feels great to type on, and with the exception of those arrow keys everything has enough space to keep me from accidentally hitting the wrong key. In fact, Apple&#8217;s keyboards were one of my first and most informative experiences with their hardware: I spent a few minutes typing on a friend&#8217;s Bluetooth Apple Keyboard, and I was hooked. Tactile feedback aside though, I have no idea which shortcut symbols equate to which keys. I know a flower-like glyph represents the command key, and that an upwards arrow signifies &#8220;shift&#8221;, but what about &#8997;? Or maybe the caret, because I know I&#8217;m not supposed to use Shift+6 every time I want to use that key combo. If Apple&#8217;s documentation will not use actual key names like Microsoft does&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;Ctrl&#8221;, &#8220;Alt&#8221;, and &#8220;Del&#8221;, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;just please&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>please</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;emblazon the keys with their symbols. Enable me to get better with my computer; don&#8217;t make it unnecessarily hard.</p>

<p>My other gripe regarding the keyboard lies at its opposite point, in the top right-hand corner: the power button. Strangely, my power button does not turn the display off every time I press it. Whenever I accidentally tap this key in search of &#8220;delete&#8221;, it somehow knows not to activate; however, when I press it down firmly, on purpose, it always works. Why? Apparently for reasons far beyong my ability to comprehend. This leads me to think that there might be a problem with my keyboard, not that the computer itself is attempting to intelligently discern my intentions with regards to this single source of input, even if that explanation is much more likely than a defective component.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m already on the topic of mistaken and misinterpreted input, how about that trackpad? 99.9<code> of the time it works like a charm with taps, clicks, swipes, and gestures, but that 0.1</code> when I have to double- or triple-tap the trackpad three times because, for whatever reason, it won&#8217;t accept my gesture&#160;&#8212;&#160;maybe my fingers are too close together; maybe the time interval between each finger landing on the screen is either too long or too short&#160;&#8212;&#160;annoys me to no end. And that&#8217;s to say nothing for its confounding inability to process even single taps on occasion. Positively bewildering. I have never had this problem on any other computer in my admittedly short life thus far. How about using some of that iOS multitouch knowhow here? <em>Just work</em>, please.</p>

<p>And then, of course, we have Mavericks. Oh Mavericks, how I love and hate you in such a visceral, constantly-at-odds way. So much about this operating system is just so, <em>so</em> good, yet an equal amount strikes me as close but halfway there at best. Take App Nap, for example: when Apple shipped Mavericks with the &#8220;Apps Using Significant Energy&#8221; section in the battery status menu, many reacted with a mixture of surprise and delight. Surprise that Apple would so publicly shame applications consuming too much energy, and delighted that this feature would lead to lower energy consumption in the future as consumers lobbied their favorite developers to empty that area. I have yet to see even one step in that direction. Granted, Mavericks only came out a few months ago, but after the initial hype died down around its inclusion, so did anyone caring about apps that violated it. I would have much preferred App Nap to force itself upon every single application running in my system by default. Disable the feature for approved apps installed through the App Store, if you must, but make every third-party offering subject to it unless I say otherwise.</p>

<p>Speaking of the &#8220;Apps Using Significant Energy&#8221; section, how about showing me the top five offenders of any level rather than only those past some arbitrary threshold? Personally, I would find much more value in this than simply showing Chrome all the time. In the middle of a coding project, for example, when I need Chrome open and a boost in battery longevity would be nice, it&#8217;s not helpful that Chrome is the only app listed there. Give me other options when this one is out of the question. This approach would have the added benefit of instituting a race to the bottom in energy consumption amongst developers for whom placement in this list, regardless of where, is unacceptable, although&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I stated earlier&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;m not entirely sure how important this is to anyone.</p>

<p>Having made our way up to the top of the screen, one of the most commonly-cited complaints and thus tweaks Apple nerds make to their system involves the menu bar. Not Andrew Clark and Zac Cichy&#8217;s podcast, <a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a>: the bar stretching across the top of your screen, inhabited by an ungodly number of app icons on its right side along with Apple&#8217;s own mandated Notification Center, Spotlight, clock, battery, volume, and Wifi menus. Unlike Windows, which allows its users to decide whether an item should display all the time, only when it requires my attention, or not at all, Apple provides for no such control. In fact, entire app categories have sprung up around this lack of customization, at the head of which is <a href="http://www.macbartender.com">Bartender</a>. I neither want nor need these icons taking up half my screen because Apple will not let me remove the language identifier for my keyboard, the AirPlay icon, the volume toggle that I never use, and the spotlight button, to say nothing of the other apps that don&#8217;t have an option to toggle this often unnecessary feature in their settings screen. I want control over this part of my Mac, too. It seems strange that Apple would leave such an important design element to third party developers rather than solve it themselves.</p>

<p>To nitpick a more basic feature, over the last few years spell check has evolved from a tool found only in Microsoft Word to a system-wide feature available in all modern operating systems. Unsurprisingly, Mavericks is no different. In fact, Apple takes it one step further and provides iOS-like auto correct in some applications. However, this is the very claim I take issue with: as far as I can tell, there is no rhyme or reason to when auto correct will activate, nor how aggressive it will correct on the off chance I do find it operational. More than this neat feature, I need consistency: either give me auto correct everywhere or nowhere at all. Auto correct informs the way I type both when present and in its absence. Making it a variable feature, then, does not exactly lend itself to a particularly positive writing experience when I have to spend an entire round of editing just fixing typos I thought it would catch.</p>

<p>Getting a bit more specific with regards to individual apps, let&#8217;s start with Finder. I don&#8217;t need every single Finder window to open every time I CMD+Tab over to the application. Instead, just give me the most recent instance; if it just so happens to not be the one I need, I can make a quick downward swipe to view all my Finder windows, select the one I want, and then from that point on it will no longer be a source of annoyance. As it stands, whenever I or another application opens a Finder window, Mavericks bombards me with every Finder instance I did not remember to close. This could be better, to say the least.</p>

<p>When I got my new Mac I switched to Safari for two reasons: first, because Apple&#8217;s native web browser fits in much better with the Mavericks aesthetic than Chrome. More importantly though, Safari uses significantly less energy, as evidenced by Chrome&#8217;s seemingly permanent spot in the &#8220;Apps Using Significant Energy&#8221; section. That&#8217;s not to say I never miss Chrome, though: every time I type a URL into Safari&#8217;s address bar, I long for Chrome&#8217;s famous omnibox. If Apple could build out a feature rivaling that of Chrome in this regard, I would immediately lose any interest in ever switching; as it is though, I consider going back with every query I have to wrestle with rather than letting Chrome do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Adding to the list of feature shortcomings in Safari, for some reason it can only reopen the one most recently-closed tab. What&#8217;s more, Safari insists on using the strange shortcut CMD+Z to do so. Consider Chrome&#8217;s implementation for some perspective: in all browsers, CMD+T opens a new tab; in Chrome, CMD+SHIFT+T reopens a closed tab. Makes sense, right? Especially given the widely-accepted convention of ALT+TAB and its reverse ALT+SHIFT+TAB; add shift for the opposite effect. Chrome wins out on sensibility, then, and implementation as well: rather than merely the most recently closed tab, I can reopen as many tabs as I want with Chrome&#8217;s CMD+SHIFT+T. I can even reopen entire windows should I so desire, and fifty tabs before it if I want to. Safari, on the other hands, only lets me do this once. Quite frustratingly, I might add.</p>

<p>Long before switching to a Mac, iTunes has been a great source of annoyance to me. This, then, has been a long time in coming.</p>

<p>Radio should not be part of the Music screen. I look to Music when I want to listen to <em>my</em> music, and radio is another form of entertainment in a class all its own. Sure, they both ultimately play melodic tunes generally subservient to a vocal track, but the similarities end there. By the reasoning that put Radio within the broader category of Music, why did podcasts get their own category separate from audiobooks and iTunes U? And why does Internet Radio get its own section outside of Music, for that matter? All share similar qualities and universally feature recorded audio tracks. How do they rank above iTunes Radio in getting their own section? It&#8217;s ponderous, this reasoning, and unfortunately it does not end there.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m on the topic of misplaced and misorganized categories, why must iTunes insist that Movies, Home Videos, and TV Shows are all distinctly different things? As far as I&#8217;m concerned&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, I would be willing to bet, the vast majority of other iTunes users as well&#160;&#8212;&#160;they are, essentially, all the same: movies. Unless one buys iTunes content and populates their library that way&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/statuses/242714233140281344">let&#8217;s be honest</a>, even if that trend has been increasing as of late I don&#8217;t think very many do&#160;&#8212;&#160;this distinction serves as little purpose as the seemingly random method iTunes uses to categorize newly-added media into one of its three cinematographic buckets.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s Mail, the revered Apple email client that I just can&#8217;t help but really dislike. For starters, how about some visual feedback when I tap the &#8220;Get Mail&#8221; button? I have to click with my trackpad&#160;&#8212;&#160;which I never do except in this situation&#160;&#8212;&#160;in order to know that I did, in fact, tell Mail to check for new messages. Otherwise, I have absolutely no way of telling. And without know whether I actually hit the button or not, I end up tapping it over and over again.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I would also greatly appreciate it if Apple would speed Mail up. A few weeks ago I moved to Airmail not for any of its other features&#160;&#8212;&#160;I honestly couldn&#8217;t tell you if it had any significant advantages over Mail&#160;&#8212;&#160;but because as soon as I get an email, I get a notification from Airmail. When I used Mail, I would see new messages appear on my phone and iPad before my computer got it, and to me that is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have talked about this back when discussing spell check, but the Dictionary app is, after all, its own beast. As a writer I use the three-finger tap to define a word and find synonyms in Apple&#8217;s built-in thesaurus multiple times in almost every article I write. Ignoring the problems with that instantiation, which I talked about earlier on the topic of the trackpad, it&#8217;s not an altogether terrible system; however, it could be much better. For one, Apple could do a better job of delineation within Dictionary.app. When does one definition end and another begin? How about antonyms? Currently antonyms get tacked on at the end like worthless baggage, if Dictionary displays them at all. This goes back to the problem of consistency I have raised a number of times already. And on the topic of a thesaurus, how about a better one? I end up turning to Google and Thesaurus.com at least once a day when Apple&#8217;s own dictionary fails me. I would really like not to have to take those extra steps.</p>

<p>So these are the most prominent problems I currently have with OS X. Over time some of these will fade, and new ones will rise up. It&#8217;s tempting to just brush them aside in a moment of glory upon discovering that my computer makes obscure tasks incredibly easy thanks to some built-in feature of Mavericks, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as is the case with any experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s important to keep in mind the downsides, for therein lie the greatest opportunities for future improvement.</p>

<p>Having emptied my Instapaper queue last night and early this morning, I went back to my old stomping ground, WordPress, in search of some interesting articles on topics outside of Apple and, possibly, technology as well. I try to do this ever so often, looking to break the Apple-centric trend so many link blogs invariably fall in to these days. Today, pursuant of that goal, I found this great piece by a high school English teacher on tangents during lectures. I must confess, I have done my fair share or rejoicing when a teacher started going down a rabbit hole. Some have been more transparent than others in allowing themselves this diversion, but I invariably felt that I and my classmates had pulled on over on her. Ha! Anyway, I really enjoyed this short article, her writing style, and her approach to a topic of great interest to me, so I went ahead and subscribed. How about you? Go spend a few minutes looking for something outside the norm. You won&#8217;t regret it, I promise.</p>

<p>In 2012, Shawn Blanc marked the fifth anniversary of starting his site by publishing an article titled <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/07/50-things/"><em>50 Things I&#8217;ve Learned About Publishing a Weblog</em></a>. Filled with some of the best advice I have ever read on the subject, I return to this article every few months, gleaning just a little bit more each time. When I look back on the years since I started following Shawn, this piece stands out in my mind as his best work. And so, given how much I enjoyed his advice, I thought I would create my own list of lessons learned over the last few years of writing on the web.</p>

<p>Taking a cue from Shawn, I will do my best to keep most of these brief; however, a few warrant some explanation, and so when necessary I will break uniformity for the sake of clarity.</p>

<ul>
<li>The incumbents became huge and successful for a reason, and have remained huge and successful for a reason. The former and latter are not always the same.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Failing to fully understand something is often the reason so many discount and disparage it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Spend more time complimenting others&#8217; work than criticizing it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Credit Patrick McKenzie</a> for this gem I couldn&#8217;t resist adding in here.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Never say &#8220;I could have done that.&#8221; Maybe you could have, but you didn&#8217;t, so you have lost the privilege to claim that idea as your own.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Take incredible pride in your own work.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Show up every day prepared to work harder than yesterday.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Never waste your time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Never waste another&#8217;s time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Realize that everyone values their own time more than everyone else&#8217;s; in other words, as much as you value your own.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You will never regret reading more than you write.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Always have a good reason for everything you do.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Never lose sight of an ultimate end-goal informing your every decision, lest you stray from your intended path and fall to ruin.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<p>Inspired by an exchange Zac Cichy and I had on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy/status/428447221361565697">earlier today</a>, and further prompted when Zac made <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy/status/428672547035435008">another series</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy/status/428673122879815680">very pointed</a> remarks earlier this evening, I decided now was as good a time as any to step away from the Apple sphere and talk about Twitter for a little bit.</p>

<p>According to the archive Twitter so generously now provides<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I joined the social network and made <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/statuses/837926911">my first post</a> on June 18th of 2008. I did so then as part of&#160;&#8212;&#160;I&#8217;m dead serious&#160;&#8212;&#160;a job, so after a brief stint consisting of that single tweet and a brief perusal of the service&#8217;s main features, I left Twitter until 2011. If memory serves, I came back after hearing Dan and John reference it to close every episode of Hypercritical up to that point. It stands to reason, after all: three years later and I began my triumphant return by retweeting <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/13">Hypercritical &#35;13</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/5by5/statuses/56401540973461504">going live</a>.</p>

<p>As I took this casual stroll down memory lane, searching for these incredibly important dates, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice a few gems. Take <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco/statuses/242745100529176576">this one</a> from Horace Dediu, for example: &#8220;Samsung has 20x more designers than Apple and yet cannot design.&#8221; Ouch. Or <a href="https://twitter.com/mathowie/statuses/242767573039587328">one from Matt Haughey</a>: &#8220;The world is much louder to 7-9 year old boys, requiring them to shout at all times, even indoors #completelytruefacts&#8221;. I cracked up laughing at that one. How about <a href="https://twitter.com/TWestonKendall/statuses/243000432341954560">this throwback</a> to the days of &#8220;teeerrrrpppp&#8221; on Back to Work? &#8220;@hotdogsladies @danbenjamin someone mentioned @ttscoff and my wife just said teeerrp from the other room. So great.&#8221; Even way back in 2012 Back to Work had superfans like Todd Kendall.</p>

<p>We also had tweets like <a href="https://twitter.com/alpesh_shah/statuses/243414167187513344">this one</a> from Alpesh Shah: &#8220;What I see in my mind when @marcoarment tells @danbenjamin he is thinking of going back to TextMate http://bit.ly/RLW7qK&#8221;. Ah, the days of Build &#38; Analyze. Perhaps I&#8217;m romanticizing it, but what a <em>great</em> show. And then, of course, we had Jim Dalrymple: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to charge people $20,000 to read the site. Then I&#8217;ll fuck off with your money. / I shall call it a startup.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/jdalrymple/statuses/243772604727566339">Politically correct</a>, as always. Plus there was the occasional <a href="https://twitter.com/rkhoo/statuses/243744082504056833">off-the-wall one</a>: &#8220;In the quest to min/max my day, I&#8217;ve learned the hard way you should never blow your nose while using mouthwash.&#8221; Yikes. And these were all from September of 2012 alone; who knows what I would find if I put a little more time and effort into combing through this archive. Gruesome personal hygiene mishaps aside though, Twitter was a great place back in the day. &#8220;Still is a great place&#8221;, I ought to say: nothing has changed, really. Sure, Twitter clamped down on third-party developers, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/03/20/why-the-quick-bar-dickbar-is-still-so-offensive">the dick bar</a> came and went, but neither the way I use Twitter nor the enjoyment I receive from scrolling through that timeline every day has changed.</p>

<p>Up until a few months ago, for the vast majority of the last six years, I primarily used Twitter as a content consumption platform rather than a medium in which to create anything, much less something of any demonstrable value. Even today, I still primarily hire Twitter to provide me with new and interesting thoughts, opinions, and articles. In a way, I see and use Twitter as the microblogging platform it set out to become. Rather than following the writers I find interesting with RSS though, I use the convenient &#8220;Follow&#8221; button next to each of their &#8220;home pages&#8221;, and I then get all their subsequent &#8220;posts&#8221; inserted into a single, easily-managed list. Nice. Compare that with the way I use RSS, and there are a number of similarities: whenever I find an interesting writer I add their blog to Reeder, ensuring that I will see every one of their future articles until such a time when they pivot to a different topic no longer of any interest to me, or my own interests shift and I decide to start following other topics. As has been the case more often than not, the latter rather than the former motivates me to unsubscribe. On Twitter, however, I have one more option: muting.</p>

<p>Say tomorrow, Jim Dalrymple alternated posting links to sites and articles he likes and finds interesting with in-depth posts about Speedos. Or, to use an example perhaps less likely to come true some day, say he decides to start talking about programming in Scala in addition to all the other topics he covers regularly. I would still have a great deal of interest in everything else Jim wrote about, so despite being totally uninterested in Scala I would stay subscribed to The Loop. Now suppose that fifty-fifty split went to 25/75 in favor of the Scala articles, and I would have even less interest in following Jim anymore despite liking his past work. Finally, imagine a scenario in which Jim went on to go an entire day without writing a single thing about anything but Scala; what&#8217;s more, he does this regularly. That &#8220;Unsubscribe&#8221; button would look pretty attractive right about then, and before long I would undoubtedly hit it. Unfortunate, for sure, but unavoidable: Jim&#8217;s interests had shifted outside of my own, and we parted ways; no hard feelings. Were that same course of events to take place on Twitter, however, I would much rather opt for a mute filter blocking &#8220;Scala&#8221; than completely unsubscribing from Jim altogether. He still writes interesting articles on occasion, after all; I would like to still see those, sans the incessant Scala talk.</p>

<p>So my reasoning went last week (two weeks ago?) when Beats Music launched, and Zac Cichy talked about nothing else for what seemed like quite some time. Instead of the thoughts on specific topics I had started following him to hear more of, Zac&#8217;s interests had pivoted to another realm&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that was fine: it is his prerogative to do so, and his only. As a result of this shift though, our interests fell out of alignment for the majority of the subjects Zac tweeted about. Had this change of pace occurred on Zac&#8217;s blog, I would have eventually unsubscribed and used that newfound time not spent scrolling through articles about Beats Music to do something productive and ultimately beneficial to me and my life somehow. Given that it took place on Twitter, however, meant that I had the option of selecting that one topic I no longer wished to hear about, completely remove it from my Twittersphere, and continue to follow Zac&#8217;s work regarding every other topic he chose to focus on.</p>

<p>Apparently, that was the wrong thing to do. I don&#8217;t intend to start a flame war with Zac over this, nor do I really even want to argue about it much. Rather, it is my hope that maybe, if he ever sees this article, he will understand where I came from and why I did what I did rather than passive-aggressively condemn my actions hours after the fact.</p>

<p>If one of my readers decided to start blocking the monthly Cabin Porn roundups I post, I say more power to them: I&#8217;m sorry those articles don&#8217;t appeal to them, but they do to me, and so I will not stop posting them. No one should have to like every single thing another person says or does: that&#8217;s too great a burden to place upon a single creative individual, and far too fine a filter for anyone to apply when in search of interesting work. For everything I create and the ten people that like it, I know 100 won&#8217;t. If those 100 still like what I do enough to allow me the privilege of occupying their valuable time in exchange for the occasional article they find interesting at the expense of not seeing the work of mine they don&#8217;t consider particularly interesting, I&#8217;m okay with that; they wouldn&#8217;t have paid it any attention anyways. What&#8217;s the point in getting worked up about it?</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Seriously, I love this feature; before Twitter announced it I lived in perpetual fear of the day I would reach 3,200 posts, meaning that with each successive tweet I would push one off the other end and slowly lose those informative recounts of my early days on Twitter to time. Now, though, I have no such fear: I can tweet, retweet, and favorite to my heart&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, most of these challenges are going to also impact Apple&#8217;s competitors in the higher-end device space&#160;&#8212;&#160;they aren&#8217;t unique to Apple. Plus, Apple has proven over and over again that they&#8217;re able to innovate in way that its competitors can only dream about. So, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not worried about Apple&#8217;s long-term fate in the least. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we won&#8217;t see a bumpy road over the next few quarters and that&#8217;s an Apple problem that has to be given serious thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob O&#8217;Donnell writing for Tech.pinions with an excellent article published in the wake of Apple&#8217;s recent quarterly earnings call. Unlike most of the commentary I have done my best to avoid thus far, Bob takes a refreshingly even-handed approach to the topic. The coming year will indeed be an interesting one for Apple and the entire mobile computing industry alike.</p>

<p>A few days ago Lorraine Luk, Eva Dou, and Daisuke Wakabayashi wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal conservatively titled&#160;&#8212;&#160;the hallmark of this upstanding publication&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304856504579338611620927036-lMyQjAxMTA0MDIwMzEyNDMyWj"><em>Apple iPhones to Come Out With Bigger Screens</em></a>. It sparked a great deal of primarily confirmatory discussion over the next few days, during which <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/wsj-apple-iphones-come-bigger-screens/">Ben Thompson</a> spoke out in favor of this rumor. Citing the Asian market&#8217;s desire for large devices, Ben made a compelling case for larger phones as Apple seeks to capitalize on the massive Chinese mobile phone industry. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/24/wsj-big-iphones">John Gruber</a>, on the other hand, did not feel similarly inclined, and made a few valid points discounting The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s piece.</p>

<p>In the past I have tried&#160;&#8212;&#160;and failed, more often than not&#160;&#8212;&#160;to stay away from the Apple rumor mill. No one wins this crapshoot and ultimately nearly every outlandish idea has some grain of truth to it. Given enough time, whatever those in this &#8220;industry&#8221; write will eventually come to pass in some form. And, as many have pointed out recently, simply confirming or denying the latest gossip does not take any special knowledge, talent, or understanding: you have a 50/50 chance every time, and no one sticks around to see whose ideas turned out wrong anyway. I do believe, however, that this exercise does have some value when not solely conjecturing as to the proposed existence of an imaginary smart watch, but rather when using it as a lens to make observations and form hypotheses regarding the future direction of our darling company. With that in mind, The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s modestly-titled article contains within it two distinct predictions worth discussing: first, we have the notion that Apple has begun developing 4.5&#8220; and 5&#8221; phones, and second, that Apple could cease producing the 5C. As is often the case, the best way to gain truly valuable insight into the present is to examine the past.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5 in 2012 brought an entirely new form factor to Apple&#8217;s mobile phone line. Starting with the iPhone 3G, this had become customary: beginning in 2008 Apple had released an entirely new phone every two years and improved upon their existing model in between, labeling these median devices with the &#8220;S&#8221; moniker many came to assume meant &#8220;speed&#8221;. Unlike previous years though, in 2012 Apple expanded its product lineup from two devices, the current model and its immediate predecessor, to three: the new 5 sat at the top, the 4S resided in the middle, and the now severely outdated 4 came free with a contract. In 2013 Apple furthered that trend and released the iPhone 5S in September, moved the 4S from its median position to the bottom tier, and repackaged and repurposed the 5&#8217;s internals in a plastic, colorful shell rebranded as the iPhone 5C, which it then positioned at the middle of its mobile lineup. Although many praised the company for this departure in strategy, this approach brought with it a number of latent problems.</p>

<p>Prior to launching the 5C, we could have reasonably expected Apple to continue releasing and updating new phones on their established tick-tock cycle every September. This well-founded trend would have prescribed 2014 seeing the launch of an iPhone 6 replacing the 5S as Apple&#8217;s flagship offering, the 5S moving to occupy the second tier, and the 4S ceasing to exist as the 5 replaced it as the free-with-contract phone. However, the advent of Apple&#8217;s lauded 5C threw a huge wrench into the works, establishing that the second member in Apple&#8217;s mobile trifecta ought to sport the previous year&#8217;s internals encased in whimsically colorful plastic and named after the current high-end offering: Apple now had the 5-&#8220;speed&#8221; and the 5-&#8220;cheap&#8221;, if you will, and that other device that no one wanted anymore. Thumbs-up, Apple, way to go. That worked out fine and <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/12/8/who-buys-the-iphone-5c">appealed to a certain demographic</a>, but now, with the next generation of iPhones just a short eight months from hitting stores across the globe, Apple must decide how to proceed with a cycle and naming convention that only fit every other year. The way I see it, Apple has three possible courses of action, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Scenario351">Scenario &#35;1: Start Making the 5 Again<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Scenario351">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Probably the least likely out of the three, Apple could re-tool their manufacturing process and begin building the defunct iPhone 5 once again. In addition to requiring a sizable capital expenditure, this option would negate any advantages Apple has seen by employing plastics and a potentially more streamlined manufacturing process up until now, although it would allow them to their previous, pre-&#8220;C&#8221; device product cycle. I don&#8217;t think this one needs any more discussion.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Scenario352">Scenario &#35;2: Create a 5SC<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Scenario352">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Alternately, Apple could leave the 5C as-is, move it to the bottom tier, and follow this fledgling trend by which last year&#8217;s phone, upon obviation by a newer device, becomes the &#8220;C&#8221; model, thereby making the current 5S a 5SC, albeit hopefully with a better name than that. This would leave Apple in the same situation it was in prior to the 5C though, with two distinctly low-end phones and one high-end device creating an uncomfortable disparity. I also find this route unlikely and thus unworthy of further serious exploration.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Scenario353">Scenario &#35;3: Keep Calm and Carry On<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Scenario353">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Finally, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;spoiler alert&#160;&#8212;&#160;this is the scenario I consider most likely, Apple could proceed as if nothing about their lineup had changed. Come September, they would move the 5C down to the free-with-contract device, the 5S into its place at the middle, and the the new 6 would assume its rightful spot on top. The 5C seems more appropriate for that tier anyway. Here&#8217;s where it gets interesting though: this course of action would find the 5C gone by the natural process of obviation come 2015 and the iPhone 6S, allowing Apple to once again build a &#8220;C&#8221; model in the 6C just as it had with the iPhone 5S and 5C. This is, in my opinion, the most logical and probable course of action; the path of least resistance. Ultimately though, we have no idea what Apple will do except for the high-end flagship model, the proposed iPhone 6, and now with the rumors of multiple larger phones in the works, even that is no longer guaranteed.</p>

<p>With regards to this eventuality, I have no doubt that Apple will create larger phones for the very reasons Ben Thompson puts forth in his previously-cited article. As every day passes and the Chinese smartphone market grows, it will become increasingly difficult for Apple&#160;&#8212;&#160;or anyone, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;to resist catering especially to this market in addition to&#160;&#8212;&#160;or instead of, perhaps&#160;&#8212;&#160;the U.S. How Apple positions such a sizable (pun intended) family of devices, however, remained unclear until the iPad Air launched alongside its smaller yet equally powerful counterpart, the iPad Mini. In this we can find a very obvious clue as to the future of Apple&#8217;s mobile phones, which will differentiate themselves based solely on screen sizes rather than technical specifications, just as the iPads now do. Many will criticize Apple for this move, saying that doing so will introduce fragmentation to the platform and take away from the delightfully simple user experience, but I disagree: equipping each iPhone with uniform hardware would allow Apple&#8217;s customers to form that important purchasing decision based solely on personal preference rather than a desire to trade portability for power. Apple gave users the ability to make this same decision with their iPads three months ago; why not extend that same courtesy to the iPhone?</p>

<p>I spend quite a bit of time writing Python in Sublime Text, navigating documents whose line counts range from ten to five hundred. System variables&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;False&#8221;, &#8220;<code>s&#8221;, &#8220;</code>Y&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and integers render in purple, strings in yellow, flow control statements&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;for&#8221;, &#8220;while&#8221;, &#8220;if&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;in red, and built-in functions&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;open&#8221;, &#8220;sorted&#8221;, &#8220;len&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;all display with an electric blue tint. These keywords only make up a small portion of my scripts, however; for the rest, I dig through line upon line of white variable names and regular expression operations. So when I saw this article from Evan Brooks on coding in color&#160;&#8212;&#160;essentially, implementing <a href="http://zwabel.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/c-ide-evolution-from-syntax-highlighting-to-semantic-highlighting/">semantic highlighting rather than syntax highlighting</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;I could immediately realize the practical application of the former over the latter. Unfortunately, given the way semantic versus syntax highlighting works though, few editors support it natively.</p>

<p>Rather than asking &#8220;<a href="http://harshilshah1910.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/yahoo-marissa-mayer-techpinions/">Is Yahoo Even Worth Trying To Save?</a>&#8221;, a more apropos question would ask not if Yahoo! was worth rescuing, but instead if Marissa Mayer&#160;&#8212;&#160;or anyone, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>could</em> actually keep the company afloat, for to operate under the assumptions imposed by the latter would be to approach this issue from the wrong direction entirely. As Harshil Shah points out in his aforecited article, Steve Jobs managed a drastic course correction of the caliber needed at Yahoo! when he made his triumphant return after the floundering Apple purchased NeXT. With that notable exception, no one else in recent history has successfully conducted such a significant change. To use that anomalous revival in support of the argument that Marissa Mayer could, if her company warranted salvation, save Yahoo!, however, does not take into account the very distinct differences between Apple of the late 1990s and the Yahoo! of today.</p>

<p>When Steve Jobs assumed control of Apple, he (famously) cut unprofitable projects and ventures with ruthless efficiency. Although some may criticize his methods, this no-compromise approach finally allowing Apple to turn a profit, and saved the company from falling at the brink of disaster. Since that turnaround, Apple has become the most valuable technology company in existence, and only rivaled in profitability by the world&#8217;s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil.</p>

<p>Yahoo!, on the other hand, operates under an antithetical philosophy to that of Steve Jobs when he revived Apple in the 90s. Rather than slash unprofitable ventures, Yahoo! prefers to use other companies and acquisitions as a means to bolster the company&#8217;s overall profitability. See their purchase of Tumblr. for proof, or the recently-launched Yahoo! Tech. Marissa Mayer does not want to cut, but to instead add in the hopes that one of these additions will save the company.</p>

<p>After AOL, Yahoo! was the first web conglomerate&#160;&#8212;&#160;the General Electric of the internet, as Horace called it, providing everything in one spot: email, sports, games, news, search&#160;&#8212;&#160;Yahoo! sought to be <em>the</em> portal to the internet. Its time has passed, and now Google seeks to take up the reigns in an even more vertically-integrated manner by offering not only all the requisite online services, but the means to use them as well: between Google Fiber, Chromebooks, and Android, Google provides every necessary service to get online and use the internet. We can&#8217;t count Yahoo! out quite yet, but at this point I wouldn&#8217;t place any more bets on it.</p>

<p>One day Kurt J. Mac decided to walk to the edge of Minecraft. Three years later he has turned what many would call a trivial pursuit into a viable revenue stream, allowing him to quit his job and take this journey full-time after identifying a way to distinguish his work and support himself thanks to the popularity of the videos he creates. His approach should sound familiar: almost everyone in the independent writer bubble&#160;&#8212;&#160;those fortunate enough to do this for a living and the people who follow them&#160;&#8212;&#160;seeks to accomplish this very goal at some point in their lives. Especially coming from an industry traditionally antithetical to this one, the similarities in approaches to fulfilling this dream are interesting.</p>

<p>Interesting article from Benedict Evans talking about the difficulty of fully understanding even one aspect of the internet or the mobile device industry. Unfortunately, all too many not only fail to accept this, but operate under the assumption that they do, in fact, have a comprehensive grasp of multiple topics on a wide range of subjects. This erroneous thinking has a significant impact on the formation of many tech writers&#8217; opinions and thus their work as well, and not for the better. Ironically, as Benedict pointed out, it also leads to some of the greatest innovations when creating actual products. Without the restrictions imposed by preconceived notions regarding what will and will not work, it&#8217;s no wonder it takes a certain degree of cluelessness to attain greatness.</p>

<p>I generally dislike interviews, but Jason Snell did a great job with this one. With the incredible popularity of the iPhone and, although to a slightly lesser degree, the iPad these days, it&#8217;s easy to disregard the Mac&#8217;s significance. Thankfully, Apple&#8217;s senior leadership does not make that same mistake.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-24 07:32:39-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/24 07:32:39 EST</time>
<p>A few years ago when I decided to start exploring the world of PC gaming, I set out with three criteria: it could not, like major titles such as Call of Duty or Ghost Recon, require a significant amount of capital just for the the privilege of participating in this hobby. Whatever I ended up choosing had to have a low price tag or, preferably, cost nothing at all. Further, my distraction of choice had to run well on a mediocre machine: I refused to suffer through jittery gameplay on an overclocked processor. Finally, it must not require a great deal of time and effort just to attain a reasonable level of proficiency. I had precious little of either to spend gaming, and none if my unwillingness to eschew everything pursuing a skill of arguably practical application meant a thirteen year old who did nothing but tap himself closer to RSI every day would beat me repeatedly. These stringent criteria left me few candidates, primarily small Flash applets like <a href="http://www.miniclip.com/games/heli-attack-3/en/">Helli Attack 3</a><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and <a href="http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/motherload">Motherload</a>. As you might imagine, each of these gave back in accordance with the amount of effort I put in; in other words, very little. So I set off in search of something more fulfilling.</p>

<p>I get the exact order of events confused from this point onward, but over the next few years I discovered a number of other great games. In as best an order as I can remember, I started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate:_The_Traitor_Soul">Fate: The Traitor Soul</a>, the only exception to my rule of not putting any money towards this hobby. At that point rule #1 had not become a guiding philosophy yet, but still remained a restriction imposed by my lack of excess capital around the age of ten. The browser-based <a href="http://youtu.be/zEbU-DspSfg">Fallen Empire: Legions</a> came next, which did not meet my minimum hardware requirements and thus lent itself to a overall poor experience despite performing exceedingly well as an intriguing source of entertainment. Another title by InstantAction called <a href="http://youtu.be/Q3DRdkNQ5UE">Lore: Aftermath</a> followed. While impressive and a lot of fun, Lore: Aftermath suffered from the same downsides Fallen Empire: Legions did. No matter, <a href="http://youtu.be/AV2E_OfmxvQ">Combat Arms</a> soon occupied the whole of my attention as the closest I ever came to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDksqnnoOWE">console-quality gaming</a>. Between bouts of warfare, numerous Flash-based distractions managed to keep me occupied, interspersed with my sole encounter with massively multiplayer online role playing games, <a href="http://www.runescape.com/community">Runescape</a>, and then, later, <a href="http://www.battledawn.com">Battledawn</a>, although I would argue that it erroneously classifies itself as a MMORPG. And then I found Roblox.</p>

<p>Although I enjoyed Fate a great deal, it literally had no end. I played an adventurer exploring dungeons, completing quests, and battling monsters as I worked my way through increasingly difficult levels moving down an infinite rabbit hole facilitated by the game&#8217;s randomized level generator. Given the creation mechanism for each successive floor, Fate&#8217;s dungeon allegedly went on forever; however, it actually bottomed out at 2,147,483,647, where the game would crash upon entry. With more than two billion floors though, it may as well have been infinite. Fallen Empire: Legions and Lore: Aftermath, on the other hand, as first person shooters, had finite ends of just a few minutes per round. Unfortunately though, their parent company, InstantAction, struggled to monetize any of its franchises and so both eventually died out. A few developers managed to keep the two up and running, but neither attracts anywhere near the numbers they once saw.</p>

<p>Like InstantAction&#8217;s short-lived forays into online, browser-based gaming, Nexon&#8217;s Combat Arms also fell into the first person shooter category. As a mercenary soldier, players would join matches and fight on a variety of maps in a number of modes, much like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Modern Warfare. However, Combat Arms required both a powerful computer and a significant time investment, neither of which I had or intended to put towards becoming better than those who spent their entire days this way. Combat Arms also had the added disadvantage of exemplifying some of the worst traits traditional console gaming has gotten a bad reputation for over the last few years, such as racism, sexism, and an overabundance of obscene and wholly uncalled for profanities. So although I could turn the quality settings down, disable some of the bells and whistles, and get it to run reasonably well on my dated laptop, I rarely enjoyed this experience. Before long, I abandoned Combat Arms just as I had Fate.</p>

<p>Peppered throughout my numerous transitions, I occasionally went back to those simple yet entertaining Flash games I had previously come to like so much. To name a few of the most prominent titles, I found solace during my search in Trech and Trech 2, the Burnin&#8216; Rubber series, Drift &#8217;n&#8217; Burn 365, Raze 2 and 3, Speed Racer, and RC Laser Warrior. Especially for their genre, the scope of a few of these amazed me, while others served their purpose of a short-lived distraction well.</p>

<p>I also played Runescape for a short while upon a friend&#8217;s recommendation. Although the diverse gameplay lent itself to an interesting experience, Runescape&#8217;s creators made it impossible to get far without a monthly membership. Given my aversion to an outright expenditure, to say nothing for my feelings regarding a monthly subscription, my tenure here was short and followed by a lengthy stint at Battledawn. Unlike every game I had ever played before, Battledawn takes place in the third person as the commander of a self-sufficient base where players use resources to build infrastructure and armies in order to conquer other colonies and expand their influence. Players can also band together and form alliances to increase their chances of success, adding a diplomatic element that kept every round interesting and different. It also, however, made for an exceptionally trying experience at times, as well as a very frustrating one. Combined with the administrators&#8217; rule by fiat and an ability to purchase course-altering resources multiple times each era, the honeymoon period ended and so did my enthusiasm for Battledawn.</p>

<p>At some point in that jumbled mess of a time line, I discovered Roblox. To my delight, it passed my three requirements with flying colors; most importantly though, I had fun playing it. <a href="http://youtu.be/MmB9b5njVbA">Like Minecraft</a>, Roblox forgoes complex graphical renderings for simplistic block-like objects and straightforward gameplay. Perhaps this simplicity caused all the serious gamers to turn up their noses at this juvenile platform, because the negative aspects online gaming has become known for as of late do not exist in this game. Everyone that plays Roblox apparently does so for fun, not out of some insane, ego-driven need to crush one&#8217;s opponents in mortal combat.</p>

<p>Outside of refreshingly uncomplicated gameplay and a pleasant community, the ability for individual players to build their own completely custom games was one of the most attractive aspects of Roblox. Using the bundled Roblox Studio app, every player could create any sort of map filled with every kind of structure, and set other users loose on it with virtually any item or weapon imaginable. Over the years, this made for some fascinating creations ranging in genre from paintball to plane wars to a simulated assault on Omaha Beach, and quite literally everything in between: obstacle courses, capture the flag, races, cops and robbers&#160;&#8212;&#160;whatever anyone could imagine, given some time and effort someone could build it. Most recently, this gave rise to an especially noteworthy and spectacular game called Apocalypse Rising.</p>

<p>Gus Dubetz and Ethan Witt began building Apocalypse Rising on April 1st, 2008, atop Roblox&#8217;s previously mentioned developer platform. More than four years later on July 1st, 2012, they declared it a completed game. Although others had built to the zombie survival genre before them, Apocalypse Rising revolutionized not only this category, but the entirety of Roblox: never before had anyone created such an expansive map, nor one with such detailed gameplay. A wonder to behold especially back in its early days, Apocalypse Rising has yet to see any credible challenges to its dominant spot as one of the greatest games ever created for this platform.</p>

<p>The appeal of Apocalypse Rising is twofold: first, the obvious draw of a game such as this lies in the challenge of surviving not only the occasional zombie, but hunger and thirst as well. Players could spend an hour just looking for a can of soda as their thirst bar creeps farther down into the red, or even longer searching for food in order to stay starvation. To add another element of intrigue, Apocalypse Rising also features the most advanced combat on Roblox today. With fifty-six different weapons strewn throughout the map and a unique ammo and attachment system, Gus and Ethan forced players to pause for thought when deciding on each and every course of action: unlike other post-apocalyptic zombie survival games that came before it, battling other players will invariably lead to death regardless of weapon or skill level; everyone that joins Apocalypse Rising must play strategically, and battle only when necessary, if at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3025201/most-creative-people/dayz-a-murder-simulator-psychology-study-and-zombie-game-tests-your-emo">Evie Nagay&#8217;s article for Fast Company</a> detailing DayZ&#8217;s uncanny ability to make its participants feel an unexpectedly visceral emotional response to digital death prompted me to start writing this, because as I read her piece and all the accounts of killing other people to survive, feeling remorseful, and then justifying the act, it was as if she had interviewed me and described every game I had ever played of Apocalypse Rising. I generally avoid combat when possible, but sometimes, with an assault rifle in hand and a long-range scope to gaze down, I break my rule and pick off a player or two. Then, like the players of DayZ, I invariably rationalize my decision.</p>

<p>The similarities between DayZ and Apocalypse Rising should come as no surprise, really: Gus and Ethan modeled their creation after Arma II&#8217;s DayZ mod, so of course they would share a number of common traits. The thing that impresses me, though, even more than the former&#8217;s ability to elicit that emotional response, is that Gus and Ethan did it in such an ostensibly innocuous environment. I never expected to find a game of this caliber on Roblox, yet there I was, rifle in hand, looking for an excuse after I had killed someone.</p>

<p>Over the years I have gone through all the walks of life with regards to PC gaming, with a special focus on online titles. This search for the perfect pastime lead me all over the internet, to all sorts of places both good and bad. The list I have made here by no means contained every game I have ever played, merely the ones I enjoyed the most. For every game mentioned by name here, there were ten others along the way that all fell short for one reason or another. Until I came to Roblox, and until I found Apocalypse Rising.</p>

<p>Closing in on two months ago now, <a href="http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/Disavow-Gaming.htm">I disavowed gaming</a> in a rather grandiose gesture that, ultimately, worked very well: over the ensuing weeks I got into the habit of writing every day and <a href="http://eepurl.com/MdDeX">started a newsletter</a>, both things I wanted to accomplish as a result of taking this drastic step. Now that I have a firm grasp on what I need to work on and how much energy I must put forth in order to do those well though, especially after Evie&#8217;s article and the intense retrospection writing this post prompted, I think it&#8217;s time I made my <a href="http://curiousrat.com/my-valiant-return-to-reading">valiant</a> return to gaming. Roblox became my favorite platform for a very good reason so many years ago; to throw that all away because I have trouble managing my priorities seems like such a waste. With some practice under my belt, I feel I can do this well now. And with incredible offerings like Apocalypse Rising, to say nothing for some of the other excellent pastimes individuals have created on Roblox, it&#8217;s high-time I got back into the ring.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-curse-of-preconceived-notions.html"><em>The Curse of Preconceived Notions</em></a>, before Monday night I had not read any of Joe Rosensteel&#8217;s work; instead, I had wrongly disregarded it in any capacity surpassing that of humorous entertainment. When I finally came to my senses and started reading his blog though, starting with <a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/73795711747/the-ubiquitous-yak-for-the-discerning-obsessive"><em>The Ubiquitous Yak for the Discerning Obsessive</em></a>, I found that I really enjoy his thoughts and opinions. So for anyone else that, like me, made a similar mistake, I thought I would compile a short list of my favorite articles from Joe, to give you somewhere to start.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/69711107323/terrible-podcast-screenplays">Terrible Podcast Screenplays</a>. Given my need to see things through from beginning to end&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have never started a podcast from any point except episode one, and always start each new TV show with its first episode&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would be remiss if I did not point you here, where things began, at Joe Rosensteel&#8217;s claim to fame.</li>
<li><a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/71732231987/yet-another-end-of-the-year">Yet Another End of the Year</a>. Like many of us, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/who-to-follow-in-2014.html">myself included</a>, Joe wrote &#8220;Yet-Another-End-of-the-Year blog post&#8221; to bring in the new year where he talked about 2012 and 2013 and zeroed in on a few intensely personal aspects of his life. In particular, I found his thoughts on using a job to define oneself especially interesting and cause for a bit of retrospection.</li>
<li><a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/72843574172/not-my-cup-of-coffee">Not my Cup of Coffee</a>. Ostensibly about coffee&#160;&#8212;&#160;because the internet <em>really</em> needed someone else talking about their fussy brewing methodology, Joe actually went on to talk about becoming okay with not pleasing everyone at every turn. For anyone considering writing publicly, I strongly recommend you read this first: it will save you a great deal of discomfort and indecision in the future. And for the record, I would have loved that pun.</li>
<li><a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/73746142327/that-pointy-thing-on-twitter">That Pointy Thing on Twitter</a>. I always find it interesting to see how another uses the same service I do, because we almost invariably employ it for different purposes. A conversation related to this one took place just over a week ago when <a href="https://twitter.com/clinton1550/status/421586419551727616">Clinton Phillips asked</a> why someone would favorite and retweet the same tweet, and I responded by saying that I favorite tweets I want to earmark for later, and retweet ones I want my followers to see.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have already subscribed to <a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com">Joe&#8217;s site</a>, and after reading these articles, you should too.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-21 20:11:47-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/21 20:11:47 EST</time>
<p>I listened to every episode of <a href="http://5by5.tv/bb">The B&#38;B Podcast</a> back when Shawn Blanc and Ben Brooks recorded it once a week up until just shy of a year ago. It came as a great disappointment, then, when it ended rather abruptly. Thankfully, I did not have to go without for long: today, Shawn announced a new weekly show to be released alongside his members-only Shawn Today podcast. I already subscribed, and I recommend you do as well: if The Weekly Brief is anything like its predecessor or reflects even a portion of its creator&#8217;s great work, it will be well worth the time.</p>

<p>While on the topic, I would just like to say that it&#8217;s encouraging to see my idea of a members-only show with <a href="http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/Doing-Monetization-Well.htm#3000VisitorsaMonth">a public counterpart</a> validated by a writer I respect as much as I do Shawn Blanc. If nothing else, it shows that I&#8217;m on the right track.</p>

<p>Given my <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/winers-lowers-and-high-school.html">recent</a> track <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-reasons-i-write.html">record</a>, you could probably predict what I will write about next just by following Linus Edwards on Twitter and reading his site. Yesterday, Linus posed a thought-provoking question asking for thoughts regarding paid memberships for independent writers, saying that he did not believe in them given their ineffectiveness. An interesting conversation ensued in which many weighed in both for and against. I did not, however, choosing to instead save my opinions for this article.</p>

<p>As a relatively new writer, I have spent a great deal of time thinking about how I can monetize this hobby. I chronicled the culmination of that effort in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"><em>Doing Monetization Well</em></a>, where I laid out a specific timeline over which I would gradually begin expanding my work here and, as I did so, start generating some revenue. Although I have since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thinking-about-the-future.html">welched</a> on that plan&#160;&#8212;&#160;albeit not for lack of effort, but instead out of solid reasoning born of a desire to concentrate my time and energy where I will receive the most benefit as a result&#160;&#8212;&#160;my strategy stands: in the near future, I will begin accepting memberships for this site.</p>

<p>As best I can recall, I first remember encountering this notion of directly supporting a writer through site memberships when Shawn Blanc quit his job and began writing full time in 2011. Back then, it seemed like a novel idea. Shortly thereafter, however, others took note and begin implementing a similar strategy, beginning with&#160;&#8212;&#160;in my jumbled chronology&#160;&#8212;&#160;Jim Dalrymple. Unlike Shawn, who offered a daily podcast, an email newsletter, and a special coffee-inspired portion of his site, Jim took a different route and chose to rely on the goodwill of others who would subscribe just to provide for him and his work. Although two very different approaches, they had two aspects in common: they were both very successful strategies, and they sought to lessen the gap between reader and writer. Ultimately, this is why I believe in memberships: whether you offer a litany of benefits or none save the wholesome feeling of helping a one whose work you enjoy, this helps foster a close connection between creator and consumer.</p>

<p>Many replied to Linus Edwards saying something along the lines of, &#8220;It depends on what I get in return.&#8221; But everyone that responded like that misses the point of memberships. To paraphrase an incredibly famous man of old, &#8220;Ask not what your favorite writer can do for you, but instead what you can do for your favorite writer.&#8221; They have to make a living too, after all; why not extend a helping hand?</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-21 12:15:53-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/21 12:15:53 EST</time>
<p>Until yesterday, every time someone mentioned Joe Steel or <a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com">his blog</a>, I immediately thought of <a href="http://terriblepodcastscreenplays.tumblr.com">Terrible Podcast Screenplays</a>. I had equated Joe to this one Tumblr, and that humorous pursuit to Joe. In my mind, they were one and the same. As a result, whenever someone referred to his work, I absentmindedly categorized it as comedic and of little value beyond a source of entertainment, and disregarded it accordingly. Late last night though, I read&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-yak.html">and posted about</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/73795711747/the-ubiquitous-yak-for-the-discerning-obsessive"><em>The Ubiquitous Yak for the Discerning Obsessive</em></a> because I finally gave Joe&#8217;s site a chance, and because he really impressed me with his writing. I then spent the next half hour reading his last twenty blog posts, finally rectifying this egregious lapse in judgment.</p>

<p>Outside of my relatively trite example, a larger point can be made with regards to podcasts. A few weeks ago Paul Riismandel posted an article under the &#8220;title&#8221; <a href="http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/01/08/podcast-survivor-in-2014-podcasting-must-enter-every-room-in-the-house/">Podcast Survivor: In 2014 podcasting must enter every room in the house</a>, where he posited that the greatest problem facing widespread adoption of the medium lies in a combination of its obscurity and a high barrier to entry. While I do agree with Paul to an extent, for I also believe that podcasting&#8217;s enigmatic nature does lend itself to primarily niche adoption, I disagree that a lack of ubiquitous consumption channels compound this problem.</p>

<p>Any television I have time for, I watch on an iPad. Although occasionally I do turn to the large, forty-inch screen downstairs in front of the couch, the time I spend using my iPad for that same task instead dwarfs that of the larger&#160;&#8212;&#160;and thus better, in the majority&#8217;s opinion&#160;&#8212;&#160;TV. In essence, this highly portable, much more capable tablet has completely obviated my need for a purpose-built monolith occupying an entire wall of a downstairs room.</p>

<p>At one point not too long ago, I used my iPad to discover, consume, and create. Essentially, everything I described using my iPhone for in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-i-do-what-i-do.html"><em>My Tools and Toys</em></a>, I once did on this tablet. However, time has relegated it to the simple job of an entertainment portal, leaving me to discover and consume new content on my phone instead, and create on my Mac. Each of these perform their requisite tasks well, hence their utilization as my go-to tool for each action: although I could use my iPhone to write long form articles, I will produce better writing in shorter time periods on my laptop; while I could watch TV on my Mac, the iPad&#8217;s slim form factor and versatility makes it a much better platform for this use case; and even though I could tote my tablet around, listening to podcasts, checking Twitter, and browsing RSS feeds all take considerably less effort with my 4S. So although each device could conceivably do the others&#8217; jobs, they excel at their respective tasks and therefore&#160;&#8212;&#160;pursuant of the best, most friction-free workflow possible&#160;&#8212;&#160;I do not require any one device to overextend itself and fulfill another&#8217;s role merely to say that I have done so. Reading Paul&#8217;s article, I cannot help but feel this is exactly what asks of everyone in order to further podcast adoption in the coming year.</p>

<p>The crux of Paul&#8217;s argument advocates increasing accessibility for the masses. Lest you feel I took this sentence out of context, I strongly encourage you to go read the entire piece: I may disagree with a portion of his ultimate point, but he makes an intelligent case for it nevertheless. In conclusion, he writes: &#8220;Closing the accessibility gap is not the only challenge podcasting faces, but it is one of the most important ones.&#8221; This is where I disagree with him, perhaps vehemently so. I listen to podcasts on my phone and on my phone only. Although I have Instacast installed on both my iPad and Mac, I cannot remember the last time I used either for this task; podcast consumption is most certainly not the job I hire either of these devices to do, wholly because my iPhone does it better, and to tie this act to another device would be to degrade it severely. Yet Paul advocates this very course of action: give them apps and channels, and they will become loyal listeners.</p>

<p>I doubt it.</p>

<p>For the same reasons I refuse to listen to podcasts on anything but my iPhone, making this medium more accessible on devices and platforms conducive to a poor experience will only leave new listeners with a bad taste in their mouth and forever ruin this incredible format for them. By Paul&#8217;s own admission throughout his post, all the popular consumption platforms already have the capability to stream podcasts. The problem does not lie in availability, then, but in viability: why do so few become involved in podcasts relative to other forms of media? In a word, to make another noun from an adjective, approachability: few see podcasts as something for normal people, but instead a <em>thing</em> for nerds or, at the very least, not for them. This is the notion we must work to change in the coming year, rather than a perceived accessibility problem combated by lowering podcasting&#8217;s already low barrier to consumption with increased platform adoption in ways favorable to subpar experiences. Sure, like I did with Joe Steel&#8217;s website, some may come around at a later date and overcome their negative associations this formative encounter will undoubtedly foster, but can we really bet this industry&#8217;s future on that? I say no.</p>

<p>When Sid O&#8217;Neill posted <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/farewell-to-text-files"><em>Farewell to Text Files</em></a>, I read his article but really had nothing to say on the topic. One person left the world of plain text files&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;so what?&#8221;, as Dan and Merlin love saying. But Joe Steele&#8217;s response, cited above, made me reconsider Sid&#8217;s predicament: the low barrier to entry plain text afforded him made testing new writing apps too easy to resist, and so Sid spent more time experimenting than working. At some point in our lives, we have all gone through something similar: I did last month when I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/disavow-gaming.html">disavowed gaming</a> and pledged myself to the constant betterment of this site. Abandoning text files was Sid&#8217;s equivalent to my denunciation of gaming. Framed this way, I applaud Sid&#8217;s decision: if leaving this format is what it takes for you to write more, then by all means, carry on. You could do much worse than &#8220;trading&#8221; versatility for productivity.</p>

<p>Sans the rather generic name, I really like Workflow. As an unnamed individual demos the app, he shows off impressive system integration by dragging Editorial-like pre-defined actions taking advantage of the camera, music, and AirDrop APIs into a queue and running it. Alternately, Workflow can also transform these processes into their own standalone apps. Wow. Impressive, to say the least. Even with such a basic feature set as the one on exhibit in its demo video, an app like Workflow has the potential to completely change the current state of inter-app communication, taking it from a tedious task necessitating difficult URL creation and fairly extensive knowledge of Python to a relatively easy process with a much lower barrier to entry. Unfortunately, I feel some of these abilities may fall outside the boundaries of the App Store&#8217;s rules, and thus Workflow may never graduate to a full-fledged app; however, I would love to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>Back from a weekend camping, I had a lot of catching up to do. Beginning with some four hundred unread tweets yesterday afternoon and approximately fifty RSS items, I have finally made my way to Instapaper where I had Linus Edwards&#8217;s ninth installment of his Daily Zen series&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/1/16/dz9"><em>The Daily Zen &#35;9 &#8220;Exposed &#38; Obscured&#8221;</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;waiting for me. I only found his blog recently, but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/winners-losers-and-high-school.html">given the nature</a> of <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/1/10/dz8">his last post</a> it came as no surprise that I liked this one a great deal. Specifically, his thoughts on why we, as a community, write on the internet and publishing our own personal blogs struck me in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question I&#8217;ve been contemplating lately. Why do bloggers (myself included) want to spin out these yarns of ideas and expressions to mostly complete strangers? It&#8217;s a strange phenomena, although maybe it&#8217;s the most human of urges - connecting with others. I think that&#8217;s ultimately why I blog, otherwise I&#8217;d just write these thoughts in a journal and call it a day. Yet, the chance to have others read what you wrote, learn something new, maybe even have it change their mind or see something in a different light. That&#8217;s the intoxication of blogging.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have tried journaling in the past, with varying levels of success. Most recently, I set out with good intentions to kick-start this habit using The Art of Manliness&#8217;s <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/01/01/jumpstart-your-journaling-a-31-day-challenge/"><em>Jumpstart Your Journaling: A 31-Day Challenge</em></a>. However, after six days I set my pencil down for good: between a full college course load, a part-time job, and spending my every spare moment working on this site, I just did not have the time nor inclination to sit down and fill out a journal entry each day, no matter how beneficial. I envy those that do, though: for the brief period in which I committed myself to this practice, I enjoyed it greatly.</p>

<p>Back to the topic at hand though, I find it ironic when writers talk about their blogs but say that they do not care for pageviews, and even more so when they characterize their site as a journal. If he&#160;&#8212;&#160;because I have a specific individual in mind&#160;&#8212;&#160;did not care about traffic, why not buy a notebook and store his every article there? Everyone that writes on the internet wants others to see their work, plain and simple. Apparently some do not realize this base desire, but it is nevertheless present on some level in all who inhabit this medium. That desire drives me, and has continued to for the last seven years: I want the greatest number of people possible to read my work and give me feedback, and I make no allusions indicating otherwise. In fact, I love finding out that someone liked my latest post, and nothing makes me happier than to hear another say that it inspired them to create something of their own. Those are incredible feelings. Those are the reasons I write.</p>

<p>You might consider this article a thinly-veiled stopgap to inevitably breaking my streak of publishing at least one new post every day. While one could certainly make that case, for I did pick this topic while searching for something to write about today, its origin does not change the relevancy of this subject.</p>

<p>Every night I spend at least half an hour between Tweetbot and Reeder searching for articles and topics to cover throughout the following day. As detailed in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-i-do-what-i-do.html"><em>My Tools and Toys</em></a>, I send everything of potential interest over to Instapaper, where I later read it and then decide whether to write an article on the subject, add it to my newsletter, or hit the &#8220;Archive&#8221; button and move on. Given the diverse nature of the sites I subscribe to and the people I follow on Twitter, I usually have no shortage of thought-provoking opinions and all-around great work to read, comment on, and use as inspiration for original essays of my own. Some days, however&#160;&#8212;&#160;take the widespread and unfortunately unavoidable coverage of CES or Google&#8217;s acquisition of Nest, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have nothing to add to that narrative. During such times, I frequently have a very hard time finding new and interesting things to write about. Today was one of those days for me.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning to a brimming Instapaper queue, ostensibly full of posts on topics I wanted to write about. As the day wore on though, article after article went by and I had published nothing. I made a few minor tweaks to my site&#8217;s design, some rather significant advances with First Crack, and added quite a few new websites and articles to my newsletter, but had failed to accomplish my goal of posting, at the very least, one piece a day. Then it came time for lunch, so I took a break and listened to <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/79">the latest episode of Systematic</a> where Marco Arment and Brett Terpstra talked about, among other things, his blog.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[22:21] &#8220;So, my site does not post every day. I don&#8217;t promise to post every day, I very rarely post more than one thing a day. I&#8217;m not doing a Daring Fireball amount of volume of, you know, five or six links a day, or more&#160;&#8212;&#160;he does so many links. I can&#8217;t keep up with that stuff, so I don&#8217;t promise it&#160;&#8212;&#160;I don&#8217;t even start it. My site is just going to be posts when I have time, when I feel like I have something to say, and that&#8217;s it. And that just so happens that&#8217;s every few days, usually. And that&#8217;s fine: the advertisers know it, the readers know it&#160;&#8212;&#160;everyone knows it; expectations are met.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of their entire conversation, this explanation in particular struck me. Marco runs a very popular website read by a huge audience of dedicated readers on a regular basis&#160;&#8212;&#160;essentially, what I seek to turn this blog into at some point in the future. Instead of posting every day though, as many would put forth as the single most important key to attaining literary success on the internet, Marco writes new articles whenever the muse strikes him, so to speak; at most, a few times a week. Yet, he has amassed a huge, responsive readership willing to follow him nearly anywhere. Taken in contrast to the mantra commonly held up as the one true path to any meaningful achievement resulting from this curious pursuit, I found Marco&#8217;s philosophy an interesting one. What&#8217;s more, the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.</p>

<p>Measuring one&#8217;s dedication to this particular genre of venture by tracking the number of posts he or she creates in a day makes no more sense than distilling a programmer&#8217;s worth to the number of lines of code they have added over a given amount of time. What happens when an entire function becomes obviated by improving another in a different part of the program? By the aforementioned metric, such a change must be counted as a net loss&#160;&#8212;&#160;the system has no room for a gray area or any ambiguity whatsoever. Similarly here, how do I account for changes to my CMS, minor design refinements, and additions to my newsletter with regards to my ultimate goal of generating new and useful content for a growing readership every day? I still have not updated my home page, yet these worthy pursuits are inextricably linked to the one I criticize myself for falling short in. These two units of measurement have similar flaws, and thus are equally useless in deriving any meaningful results.</p>

<p>I understand the necessity of giving readers insightful and thought-provoking work in order to keep them coming back day after day and thus expand one&#8217;s readership, but I now realize that my efforts do not have to take the form of one more in a long line of linked list posts. How many have I published in the past only to fulfill some self-imposed quota? No one visits my website to see me say, &#8220;I have been reading this article for a few minutes now, and I have to say that I really like it&#8221;, nor would I want anyone to: I want my voice, thoughts, and opinions to draw people to my work. Some days, I just won&#8217;t have anything to contribute. And you know what? That&#8217;s okay, because even if no one sees it, I am always working.</p>

<p>I have written <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-ipad-pro.html">a</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/clocking-down-the-mini.html">number</a> of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-on-the-ipad-pro.html">articles</a> in the past speculating as to what an iPad Pro could do to differentiate itself from Apple&#8217;s two existing models and thus merit its addition to the lineup. In all those posts, my proposed device most closely tracked with Federico&#8217;s &#8220;Option B: A &#8216;Pro&#8217; iPad With Substantial Software &#38; Hardware Changes&#8221;. Like Federico, I find the case for the alternatives&#160;&#8212;&#160;his &#8220;Option A&#8221; and &#8220;Option C&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;difficult to make, to say the least. I won&#8217;t rehash each of my articles or Federico&#8217;s points here, but suffice it to say that I think it very likely that we will see an iPad Pro very soon from Apple. With the 2013 Mac Pro ironically shipping in 2014, perhaps 2014 will be the year of the Pro.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-16 11:23:12-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/16 11:23:12 EST</time>
<p>The past ten days have astounded me. I entered 2014 with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html">low expectations</a>, tentatively hoping to increase my readership by some small integer multiple year over year. Over the next two weeks, however, I surpassed traffic for the entirety of 2013 with fifteen days left in January. What&#8217;s more, these readers keep coming back: although pageviews decreased after the initial surge from Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s link faded, my readership has continued to grow since then at an impressive (and mildly alarming) rate. RSS subscriptions have increased as well by a factor of five, and I now have nearly as many signed up for my newsletter as I had daily visitors in 2013. This has given me a great deal to think about, and forced me to keep my head down working feverishly in my every spare moment. Now, though, with a brief respite between articles, I have started thinking about the future.</p>

<p>As promised, I began publishing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-neat-and-out-of-scope-newsletter.html">The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter</a> when I realized the unlikelihood of my traffic ever returning to the low figures I saw throughout 2013. I did not, however, expect those numbers to bottom out well above the halfway point in my goals list: I felt comfortable expecting to double my daily readership, and optimistic that I could triple it. I saw only ludicrousy in hoping for anything more. Yet here I stand, traffic increasing at an incredible ~30% every day. I have a great deal of catching up to do, then: by my own goals, I now owe everyone two newsletters, at least one of which published weekly. I also need to start seeking out sponsorships, and begin accepting memberships. Learning about GitHub, given that I promised to make beta versions of my code projects available to members, would be a worthwhile investment as well. While I&#8217;m at it, I should begin exploring podcasting equipment too: at this point, it looks like I will cross that mark in February.</p>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>So this is what I&#8217;m thinking: I have already started preparing for the next installment of The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter, slated for January 26th, so I will release it as scheduled; next month, I will begin sending it out weekly unless its current subscribers <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/423839263793623040">feel I ought to do otherwise</a>. As for my more data-driven mailing list, I will include its content at the end of my existing newsletter until it grows large enough to merit a publication of its own. I have traditionally shunned the job of an analyst, so this entire subject is new to me. Proceeding in this way will allow me to ease myself into this new role.</p>

<p>As for actually generating some revenue, I expected that my growth to 2000 monthly visitors would take significantly longer than it did. With not even a month of statistics under my belt, I cannot feasibly elicit sponsorships from anyone. Instead, I will wait until April when I can show three months&#8217; worth of metrics, at which point I believe I can make a good case for an individual or company handing over a sum of money in exchange for featuring an app or service here. Similarly, I will wait to begin offering memberships for a little bit longer until I can stabilize this hectic pace. Unless traffic takes a drastic dive between now and April, I will begin accepting memberships first. Rather than build my own system and deal with that hassle, I plan to go with Memberful which I found <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/15/independence-day-three/">thanks to Brett Terpstra</a>, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/">who just quit his job</a> and <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/brett-terpstra-goes-indie/">went indie</a>. Given that I based my plans for a podcast on sponsorships and offering two distinct versions&#160;&#8212;&#160;one with ads and the other without&#160;&#8212;&#160;and its reliance on a group of members to publish for, I must postpone this, too, at least until May. However, when I do finally get around to it, I know where to go: Dan Benjamin just posted the update to his 2011 article <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/podcasting-equipment-software-guide-2011"><em>Podcasting Equipment Guide</em></a> as its own, standalone site: <a href="http://www.podcastinghandbook.co">The Podcasting Handbook</a>. When I start my daily podcast, I will look there for all my equipment needs.</p>

<p>I realize I have not quite lived up to my promises, now that I have deigned to push a number of these ventures back by a fairly significant amount of time; however, more important than just doing another newsletter, asking for sponsorships, and putting out a podcast is&#160;&#8212;&#160;to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;doing it <em>well</em>. I want to take pride in everything I publish. If that means shifting my timeline slightly, that&#8217;s fine with me.</p>

<p>Many have called the blogging racket an echo chamber, wherein one popular writer says something mildly interesting and everyone else immediately links to that article with trite, nuanced comments tacked on after a paragraph or two taken in excerpt. Anyone following <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuaginter">Joshua Ginter</a> and I over the last few days would have seen us epitomize the circular nature of that stereotype in our recent exchanges, albeit sans popularity: first, I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"><em>Doing Monetization Well</em></a>, and Josh replied with a thoughtful piece titled <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/cashing-in-the-blog"><em>Cashing In A Blog</em></a>. Continuing the cycle, I then published <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cashing-in-a-blog.html"><em>Tangible Goals</em></a>, to which Josh wrote in response with <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/zac-szewczyks-tangible-goals"><em>Zac Szewczyk&#8217;s Tangible Goals</em></a>. However, we did much more than frivolously compliment each other.</p>

<p>Over the course of these four articles, I outlined my ambitions for this site and further substantiated them when Josh made the well-founded&#160;&#8212;&#160;certainly nothing to feel ashamed of&#160;&#8212;&#160;criticism that I had set my readership goals far too low. Ostensibly, the course of events proceeded thusly. On a deeper level though, Josh and I had expanded our worlds ever so slightly to include the other, his thoughts, and his writing. We each went from following <em>n</em> writers to <em>n+1</em>, a decision made through a significant semi-conscious vetting process we both conducted independently of one another over the last week. We had &#8220;networked&#8221; in the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, I have discovered a number of other writers as well.</p>

<p>Like Josh, I also just recently happened across <a href="http://twitter.com/typistX">@typistX</a>. We got in touch after I posted <em>Doing Monetization Well</em>, which he found thanks to <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/07/rethinking-web-site-monetization/">Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s link</a>. Since then he has surprised me on multiple occasions with generous offerings of time and attention I had previously only seen hugely popular writers elicit of their readers. It amazed me, for instance, that he not only offered a great deal of feedback regarding this site&#8217;s latest design as I muddled my way through the process, but that he also served as the single driving force behind making this site cross-browser compatible. Without his input and willingness to seek out dated Windows machines throughout the testing process, Firefox users would still not have a styled page. I owe Shibel a huge debt of gratitude, to put it lightly. On top of that he also writes about technology&#160;&#8212;&#160;right up my alley&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, more importantly, <a href="http://thetypist.com/348/chaos-order/">does so extremely well</a>. We, too, had &#8220;networked&#8221;, in the most base sense of the term.</p>

<p>Before starting this site, I spent a lot of time interacting with individuals within my small niche. And it <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/may-i-have-some-more.html"><em>paid</em></a>: I had a fantastic time working on those sites, and they attracted the largest audiences I have ever laid claim to. One of them, despite its abandonment more than two years ago, almost managed to stay on track with this website&#8217;s readership where I post new content every single day. Those figures blew me away when I dusted them off. I had done everything &#8220;right&#8221; since then, after all: I posted regularly, submitted every article to Hacker News, and pleaded with popular bloggers to just take a look at this new post of mine. But I left out one thing, perhaps the most important thing; the key to not just statistical success, but real, tangible success as well: the humanity of it all. I had so sanitized this experience that I took out the best part. Namely, everyone else. This was my greatest mistake in conducting myself after starting this website, and one that thankfully only took me a year to remedy. I would have labored away alone and in a dark room for God only knows how much longer, scrounging at the bottom of the proverbial barrel for something; anything. But now I have companions to toil alongside me, individuals going through the same struggles I face to which I can look for guidance and camaraderie. I know that if I reach out to one of them, they will respond; that if I write a great article, they will see it. If I ever publish something wildly off base, my newfound compatriots will tell me. Most importantly though, this is a two-way street: I see their work, and nothing makes me happier than providing valued feedback.</p>

<p>In the end, I did not need to break in to the existing Apple tech blogger community and usurp a John Gruber, a Shawn Blanc, or a Federico Viticci. Ultimately, I found my niche and created my own community around it. And that, my friends, is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>I decided to start this article in response to <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LinusEdwards/status/423245321142304768">a remark Linus Edwards made</a> saying that although a tech blogger, he felt like a bad one given his lack of knowledge regarding the intricacies of RSS, which prevented him from keeping an accurate record of those subscribers. I faced a similar problem shortly after launching this site, but solved it soon afterwards. As they say though, every day someone comes into the world having never seen the Flintstones. Today I thought I would take some time to explain how I go about doing what I do here in the hopes that it will save someone time, energy, and frustration in the future, or just make their life a little bit easier through a new app or service they had previously never heard of. Before I can get into the nitty-gritty details of back-end sites and services though, I must provide a frame of reference by talking about the front-end devices and apps I use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Right now I own an iPhone 4S. With few exceptions, I do all of my article discovery and capture on this device. Using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8">Tweetbot 3</a>, I check Twitter throughout the day, talk with others, and collect links for later with Instapaper. For RSS I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8">Reeder 2</a> to browse my ever-expanding list of feeds<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but rarely read anything here either: whenever a noteworthy post comes up, I instead send it Instapaper&#8217;s way. In addition to these two apps, I use one more for finding new and compelling content: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zite/id419752338?mt=8">Zite</a>. Unlike others in this category such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/interesting-for-iphone/id586848801?mt=8">Interesting</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/machash-news/id407673940?mt=8">MacHash</a>, Zite consistently presents me with content on a wide range of topics I end up enjoying. Although I could use its learning engine and categories to make this experience even better, thus far I have felt no need to do so: even right out of the box, Zite does a nice job of highlighting interesting work. I also have Instapaper on my phone, but rarely use it as a &#8220;read later&#8221; service: I would much rather read on my computer when I get home than squint at my iPhone&#8217;s relatively small display for thousands and thousands of words. Instead, I use Instapaper as the location to which I send everything I want to take note of in any way, regardless of whether I simply wish to reference it later or write a full-fledged diatribe on the subject.</p>

<p>As I have discussed <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html">at</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/testing-the-apple-tax.html">length</a> in the past, I bought a new 15" Retina MacBook Pro right after Tim Cook announced the new models at last year&#8217;s iPad event in October. Although prior to that purchase I wrote almost exclusively on my iPad, the much more capable Mac quickly replaced it as my go-to machine for everything but watching movies. Whereas previously I used <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-for-ipad/id542797283?mt=8">Drafts</a> for quick capture and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8">Editorial</a> when writing long form pieces, I now use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 3</a> for both. Featuring a broad set of useful keyboard shortcuts, easy extensibility, great performance, and vast customization, I keep at least three separate windows open at all times, each housing multiple documents. After finishing an article of any considerable length, thanks to tight integration with Sublime Text 3, I activate Brett Terpstra&#8217;s <a href="http://marked2app.com">Marked 2</a> with a quick keyboard shortcut. Marked functions as my own personal editor by highlighting overused, overly complex, and repetitious words, forcing me to reword a great deal of my writing I would have otherwise left untouched throughout the editing process. Finished there, I hand my latest article off to FirstCrack.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-first-crack.html">topic</a> I have <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-in-practice.html">talked</a> a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/complete-overhaul.html">great</a> deal <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">about</a> in the past, I use my custom-built CMS First Crack to parse plaintext files and generate my entire site and RSS feed. These 649 lines of Python do the vast majority of the back-end work, including updating my site with new posts via FTP. Once uploaded, <a href="https://bitly.com">Bitly</a> shortens my links so that I can easily post them to Twitter with the added bonus of analytics should I want to see how many discover my article through this medium. With Google Analytics on every public-facing page though, I have rarely found a use for Bitly&#8217;s built-in tracking features. Keeping accurate RSS subscriber metrics, on the other hand, proved much more difficult: after Google Reader&#8217;s demise and with Feedburner on its way out I, along with the rest of the internet, searched for an alternative. Thankfully, I quickly found one in <a href="http://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike more invasive and complex methods&#160;&#8212;&#160;counting server requests for an RSS feed, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;FeedPress merely asks that its users associate a valid XML file with each account, and then point users towards a custom URL rather than the actual feed. Now, whenever an RSS reader refreshes, it checks in with FeedPress&#8217;s servers which log the activity and then serve the appropriate file. Everyone walks away from the transaction happy: I got my statistics, and my readers successfully subscribed to my site in their favorite RSS client. After that, I head back to Instapaper and begin the process all over again.</p>

<p>Ben Thompson once again, continuing his streak of great articles with this gem. I found his &#8220;Some additional notes&#8221; section particularly interesting, where he explained the implications of this move to the other major tech companies of today.</p>

<p>A fascinating look at the current state of business models and their inevitable future from Ben Thompson over at Stretechery. An excellent article well worth the read going in to 2014. Especially in this coming year, I believe, this knowledge and a solid understanding of it will prove invaluable.</p>

<p>When I started this website, I had a number of misgivings. For example, every writer I looked up to had already done this for years or, in some cases, even decades; what could I possibly contribute to such a mature community? I had missed the boat, failed to get in on the ground floor&#160;&#8212;&#160;what hope could I have of rivaling the skill, insight, and popularity of folks like John Siracusa? I struggle similarly with my desire to build an app. But, as John points out in his article <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422749828448542721">ostensibly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422756689449062400">about</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422756972136787968">his</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422767118988619776">journey</a> to U2 <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422767155697156096">geekdom</a>, time does not automatically impart upon anyone the necessary traits common to geeks; rather, they are born from a great deal of effort, and anyone that tells you otherwise, that there is some barrier to entry beyond that, is wrong.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-13 18:21:29-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/13 18:21:29 EST</time>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co">Josh Ginter</a> responded to my article <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"><em>Doing Monetization Well</em></a> with a very thoughtful <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/blog/cashing-in-the-blog">post of his own</a>. To no great surprise on my part, he questioned the viability of sponsorships at my low threshold of just 2,000 visitors per month. I expected someone would, and I can not fault Josh for doing so: I picked such low numbers on purpose because I wanted to have tangible, achievable goals I felt some confidence in my ability to attain. Even if I only get ten or fifteen dollars a months, that will cover hosting and take this from a cost center to a profitable venture, while simultaneously setting me on the path to further monetization down the road as my readership continues to expand. In my eyes, that&#8217;s a win.</p>

<p>Amidst his wholly justified reservations regarding my own strategy going forward, Josh tucked a great, widely-applicable nugget of advice anyone starting a blog ought to keep in mind:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Blogs are cash vacuums. Investing money in design, branding, advertising and hosting does not guarantee any return for your investment. Anyone can generate page views by throwing money around, but creating long-term readership is essential to properly monetizing a blog. Finding a niche, dissecting that niche and adopting a proper style of writing is the key to turning a blog into a small business.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like writing, maintaining a blog requires a great deal of effort; like good writing, running a good blog proves exponentially more difficult. Those who endeavor to attain the latter for the wrong reasons will inevitably fail, although they may see moderate success when working towards the former. Every once in a while, though, a writer comes along willing and able to devote incredible amounts of time and effort into both excellent prose and building a splendid blog. Those are the individuals who go on to greatness, the ones who make a living from this work. This is the one goal I did not put on that list, the one that I could not have attached a number to even if I had; this is the goal I am constantly working towards, one small step at a time.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-13 16:52:42-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/13 16:52:42 EST</time>
<p>I will not pretend to have some groundbreaking insight born of years watching Apple and scrutinizing its marketing tactics, but perhaps this inability to immediately evaluate, classify, and dismiss <a href="http://youtu.be/jiyIcz7wUH0">Your Verse</a> works to my advantage in this case. In <a href="http://512pixels.net/2014/01/apples-verse/">his article</a> written shortly after the ad went live, Stephen Hackett conveyed his general disappointment in Apple at employing a tactic of engendering a powerful emotional response from its viewers once again, as it did <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/misunderstood.html">last month</a> with <a href="http://youtu.be/nhwhnEe7CjE">Misunderstood</a>. Others have made similar criticisms, some even going on to chastise Apple for making their latest ad <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-airs-new-your-verse-ipad-air-commercial/">unrelatable</a>.</p>

<p>As Zac Cichy pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy/status/422738622752649216">earlier this afternoon</a> though, Apple did not make Your Verse for those who already happily own its products, and especially not for anyone who uses Editorial to create Python scripts that download and parse close to ten thousand WordPress articles into Markdown: we already know we made the right choice&#160;&#8212;&#160;that we picked the right team, in Stephen&#8217;s words. No, Apple made Your Verse for everyone on the fringes of its ecosystem, those looking in with indecision. I would take Zac&#8217;s theory one step further and say that Apple also created this ad for its apathetic users&#160;&#8212;&#160;the parents, grandparents, and relatives who had an iPad recommended to them over a Kindle Fire&#160;&#8212;&#160;who see this device as nothing more than a plaything. Your Verse is Apple ever so subtly beating its viewers over the head, doing its darnedest to show everyone that the iPad is not <em>just</em> a toy, but actually so much more. Ben Alexander hit the nail on its head <a href="https://twitter.com/fiatluxfm/status/422742819720028160">responding to Zac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I think the recent sequence of ads could all be considered a user manual:</p>
<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s what these things are for dammit.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple targeted an audience that see their iPads as portals for Candy Crush, email, and Amazon&#8217;s Kindle app by showing them marine biologists who take these nondescript tablets a hundred feet underwater and engineers who bring them equally far above ground atop a wind turbine adrift in the middle of the ocean. If an iPad can do all those things and more, surely it can accomplish more than run the same three apps all the time. Therein lies the genius behind Your Verse: it may not be relatable, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be: it&#8217;s inspiring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;To me &#8216;Your Verse&#8217; shows you can do anything. If you can stand on top of a giant windmill, record a movie, improve your hockey game and compose music, surely you can read a book.&#8221; - <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/13/thoughts-on-apples-tv-ad-your-verse/">Jim Dalrymple</a></p>

<p>Today marks the first installment of my brand new newsletter, awkwardly titled &#8220;The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter&#8221;, in which I talk about an alternative to MailChimp, shaking a device to trigger Javascript actions, speedy scrolling, House of Cards&#8217;s second season, the latest foray into podcast clients, and the just-launched clipboard utility Command-C. In case you missed it, you can subscribe <a href="http://eepurl.com/MdDeX">here</a> or by clicking the &#8220;Newsletter&#8221; menu item below. All in all, I am very happy with how it turned out. I do, however, recognize the significant room for improvement I still have within this medium. You can expect it to get better with every issue, because I have every intention of making this one great newsletter.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-12 10:13:52-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/12 10:13:52 EST</time>
<p>Prompted by <a href="https://twitter.com/typistx/status/422270033340166144">a question from Shibel</a> early this morning wondering how I determine where to publish a given article, to my site or my new newsletter, I decide what content goes where and when to release it based on a relatively simple heuristic: when I write for my website I strive to do so in service of furthering the overarching narrative with regards to topics I currently have some degree of interest in. Pursuant of this goal, I write long form articles and link to others&#8217; work who have varying viewpoints and provide commentary I feel my readers will value but may not otherwise see elsewhere. I started The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter to have a place in which I could write without those restrictions, somewhere that I could publish my thoughts on any given topic not beholden to a desire to advance its associated conversation. This will manifest itself in new genres I have previously only covered on occasion or not at all.</p>

<p>Take my brief digress in to the second season of House of Cards in the latest issue, for example: I would not have written anything about it otherwise, yet this medium provided me with a platform through which I could share my thoughts on the matter. Similarly, with the exception of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/castro.html">Castro</a> I rarely write about new apps, instead choosing to leave that to the likes of Federico Viticci who I know will do a much better job than I ever could. However, the first installment of what will hopefully become many newsletters in the future features two mini reviews of Network and Command-C. Albeit only a paragraph or two in length, these opinions would have never seen the light of day had I not put them into this newsletter.</p>

<p>This is how I will designate articles and topics to one venue or the other. Think of The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter as an extension of my website governed by fewer rules and policed with less severity, a backstage pass of sorts giving you added insight into any and all subjects on my mind. I will still devote most of my time to writing original articles and collecting interesting pieces from around the internet, but now I have an outlet for everything that does not make it through the stringent editing process.</p>

<p>Although still waiting for the dust to settle after Jim Dalrymple linked to my article <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html"><em>Doing Monetization Well</em></a>, I believe I will cross the twenty readers per day line once my traffic returns to normal. As promised, I started a newsletter tentatively titled <a href="http://eepurl.com/MdDeX"><em>The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter</em></a>. Unfortunately, more than the title needs work; however, I have done the vast majority of the heavy lifting today, so from here on out I can focus on small design tweaks and pour most of my efforts into collecting cool code projects and interesting articles I deign not to craft extensive articles for, but still wish to write about in some capacity for future issues. The first installment will go out tomorrow evening at 6:00; I hope your name will be on the list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Markets can sustain more than one company or product. There doesn&#8217;t have to be an ultimate winner in everything, and most of the time the market is fragmented into various successful companies and products. You can have Android with a huge market share and still have iOS be successful and profitable; neither side has to kill the other to survive. Markets are endlessly complex things filled with shades of gray, and while it&#8217;s nice to try and fit them into set boxes, it&#8217;s fantasy, plain and simple.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An excerpt from another installment of the Daily Zen, a series of articles Linus Edwards&#160;&#8212;&#160;who distilled a lengthy Twitter conversation into a great article titled <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/1/8/the-hard-way"><em>The Hard Way</em></a> just a few days ago&#160;&#8212;&#160;endeavors to post daily. I found this observation especially interesting when applied to the world of writers who publish independently on their own websites, where many possess the incorrect notion that one individual&#8217;s success must come at the expense of another&#8217;s. In both cases, this is an equally incorrect belief.</p>

<p>Finally getting around to a few blogs I have wanted to check out for almost a week now, earlier this morning I read Harshil Shah&#8217;s third blog post since starting his new site. I enjoyed his refreshing honesty, and his new approach seems like a great middle ground between pushing so hard he burns out once again and posting two articles for the entirety of 2013. I look forward to reading more of his excellent writing <a href="https://twitter.com/harshilshah1910/status/422039100074373120">very soon</a>, and you should too.</p>

<p>After catching up on the latest episode of White Collar<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and clearing my Instapaper queue, I spent the rest of my morning going through a few gear websites. While not all carry wares with the vintage feel that almost every item on <a href="https://secure.huckberry.com/store">Huckberry&#8217;s</a> store has, each site picks out the best product for its respective category, whether styled to match this century or not. Personally, I prefer the former: I love gear and apparel that could have come out of a 1900s-era general store. It looks cool, works great, and I know it will last so long as I take care of it.</p>

<p>I started out with <a href="http://www.itstactical.com">ITS Tactical</a> looking for modern tactical equipment, things I could use every day and take with me when I went camping. However, while I did find one or two items that fit this bill, the site&#8217;s design made any navigation too unwieldy and confusing to find anything more than a few semi-interesting articles. If only have a limited amount of time to spend on cool gear sites, I would not spend it here.</p>

<p>Much more my style, <a href="http://www.bestmadeco.com">Best Made Company</a> features bespoke, artisanal wares ranging from organic syrup to rucksacks. Personally, I love&#160;&#8212;&#160;and still may purchase&#160;&#8212;&#160;the <a href="http://www.bestmadeco.com/collections/camp-supplies/products/peanut-lighter">peanut lighter</a>. Although I generally prefer starting fires with matches, I would happily make an exception for this little guy.</p>

<p>Similarly inspired with a much greater focus on apparel, <a href="https://cloakanddapper.us">Cloak &#38; Dapper</a> sells everything from socks to tie bars. Although I have no need for such elegant clothing at this point in my life, I realize some do, and that I will as well in the future.</p>

<p>Ostensibly a site about slim wallets, clicking <a href="http://bellroy.com">Bellroy&#8217;s</a> &#8220;LEARN&#8221; menu item opens a whole new world of great tips and tricks for traveling light, packing well, and caring for traditionally finicky materials like leather. Their shop does not feature as wide a range of products as the aforementioned sites, but Bellroy makes up for lack of variety with excellent articles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jllawsonco.com">J. L. Lawson &#38; Co.</a>. Primarily dealing in brass accessories, I found their blog the only mildly interesting aspect of this website. I did enjoy the <a href="http://www.jllawsonco.com/blogs/news/10020605-i-made-it-out-of">I made it out of...</a> video, though, which took me back to this time last year and the hours I spent over a mill and lathe machining parts for a robot.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Honorablementions">Honorable mentions:<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Honorablementions">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Sites that I did not set out to visit this morning but later did so to compare products with these other shops, or just places I wanted to point out because&#160;&#8212;&#160;as the saying goes&#160;&#8212;&#160;every day someone is born who has not seen The Flintstones: while some of you may already know and frequent these websites, at least one person will have never heard of them before.</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.huckberry.com/store">Huckberry Store</a>. As previously mentioned, Huckberry&#8217;s store features an impressive range of products in every category. Like Bellroy, Huckberry does not just sell merchandise, but writes as well: their <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog?onsite=stb">journal</a> entries and newsletters are both consistently great and well worth the read.</p>

<p>I first discovered <a href="http://topodesigns.com">Topo Designs</a> when Huckberry featured one of their backpacks, the <a href="http://topodesigns.com/collection/klettersack/">Klettersack</a>, on their store a few months ago, and have since only managed to avoid spending way too much on their site through a herculean effort: they not only offer neat products, but useful ones as well. A dangerous combination, for sure.</p>

<p><a href="http://toolsandtoys.net">Tools &#38; Toys</a>. I have talked about Shawn Blanc&#8217;s venture Tools &#38; Toys a few times in the past after reading an excellent review of a just-launched app or new gadget, always in a complimentary tone: their reviews are not only short and succinct, but well-researched as well. I would not have to stretch far in order to confidently say that Tools &#38; Toys reviews are some of the best on the internet.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="http://thewirecutter.com">The Wirecutter</a> has gained a reputation as the premiere device review site, and rightfully so: whether writing about <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/solar-joos-orange-best-solar-battery-pack/">the best solar battery pack</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;I want one&#160;&#8212;&#160;or <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/mission-workshop-r6-arkiv-field-backpack/">Mission Workshop&#8217;s R6 Arkiv Field Backpack</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;I <em>really</em> want one&#160;&#8212;&#160;The Wirecutter&#8217;s articles strike a difficult balance between in-depth reporting and the succinct style I have come to appreciate so much from Tools &#38; Toys.</p>

<p>So there you have it, the websites I spent my morning with, and will likely spend many an hour more with as I drool over some gadget or tool until I eventually break down and add it to my cart.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Wow. Just when it had started to fall back into the usual refrain of Neal and Peter getting a case and then solving it by the hour&#8217;s end, White Collar&#8217;s writers shifted gear with the last few episodes and threw us curve ball after curve ball, daring us to keep up and challenging everyone to predict the next. Needless to say, I did <em>not</em> see this coming. USA Network really does make some of the best shows on television today.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/twelve-hours.html">A Complete Redesign in Twelve Hours</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-10 18:59:04-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/10 18:59:04 EST</time>
<p>Over the last few days I have received a ton of great feedback on both a number of my articles and my site&#8217;s design as well. While the former has remained consistently positive, the latter refrain almost invariably included the same two criticisms: that I had set the font too small, and that every line contained too many words spread much too far across the screen for a comfortable reading experience. Others recommended that I find a way to differentiate linked list items from my own posts, but by and large the most common suggestion advocated a larger font size and decreased content column width. Today, I have addressed those issues and many others with my latest redesign, live with this article.</p>

<p>Contrary to what I may have alluded to when responding to those offering feedback with regards to my site&#8217;s design, I had only thought about it in the abstract up to that point. I had created no wireframes, selected no color schemes, and had not even begun thinking about a particular font&#160;&#8212;&#160;besides knowing that I did, in fact, need to design a new website, I had not fleshed out any of the implementation details whatsoever. Busy with writing and working on First Crack, I just did not have the time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, that did not keep me from trying.</p>

<p>With the exception of some minor styling code for block quotes, links, and footnotes, I deleted every CSS definition until I had a blank, <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/420750176026763264">plain text</a>-esque layout. Then the fun began: I needed to decrease my main column&#8217;s width, so I pushed it down to 50<code> and centered it. Looking good so far. With my old code gone, the font already rendered at a much larger size than it had previously; both here and in the default color scheme of black text on a white background, the automatic browser styling would do. However, everything looked too squished: I needed more whitespace, so I upped the line height to 200</code> and added a generous margin around every article and the top and bottom of the screen. Mostly satisfied with the layout, I moved on to fonts.</p>

<p>I follow a number of well-read writers who place great stock in good font choices, so I realized the significance of a great typeface early on as one of the most important aspects leading to an enjoyable experience. With this in mind, I turned to my trusty sidekick Google Web Fonts in search of an attractive option that would lend itself to both a visually pleasing design and an easy reading experience. With more than six hundred choices just for the Roman alphabet though, I quickly became overwhelmed. Unsure where to begin, I decided to see what everyone else used in the hopes of stumbling across something I really liked. I looked to <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a> first and then <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>, where I thought to explore potential options on Typekit.</p>

<p>Given the importance of a great font, I had prepared myself to pay handsomely for one; however, when I discovered that Typekit charged for variants I could find on Google Web Fonts for free, I turned my attention back to Google and eventually decided on the smooth sans serif <a href="http://typecast.com/preview/google/Roboto">Roboto</a>. Although I tried a number of others, everything paled in comparison to Roboto. With a font in place, then, I went back to tweaking layout and spacing. As the day wore on and it grew steadily darker outside, I became increasingly less satisfied with my chosen color scheme: it reminded me of a comment Tweetbot&#8217;s developers had retweeted of someone complaining that the bright white layout made their eyes bleed at night. Hoping to save my readers some pain, I began exploring a dark mode.</p>

<p>Ever since starting my site, I had done constant battle with two warring factions within my mind: one advocated an incredibly minimalist design featuring nothing but the absolutely necessary HTML and CSS, while the other wanted to include jQuery pursuant of some really neat ideas I could not implement otherwise. Partway through December, the latter prevailed when I shipped an incremental update featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/pxldots">Chris Sauve&#8217;s</a> jQuery plugin <a href="http://www.bigfootjs.com">Bigfoot</a> after <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/15/bigfoot">Marco began using it</a> on his site. Having crossed the proverbial Rubicon, I also included <a href="http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/pointer-events-60fps">a slick trick</a> for enabling faster, smoother scrolling, which also necessitated a bit of scripting. Given that I already imported jQuery and ran some Javascript upon each page load without a significant performance hit, it made my decision to go with a scripting-based option much easier instead of the convoluted CSS workaround I would have otherwise attempted to implement.</p>

<p>I could have easily added a &#8220;Display Preferences&#8221; page similar to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/preferences/">John Gruber&#8217;s</a>, but I wanted to do something much more elegant. Ideally, I wanted to toggle a light and dark mode with a single key press; thankfully, Javascript could not only do this, but I could do it with relatively few lines of code and without a plugin bringing along hundreds of extra lines and features I would never use. While this made for a great experience on my computer, iOS devices, famously, do not have keyboards. It seemed I would have to forfeit my goal of an elegant implementation not requiring that I add an entire page devoted to one tertiary feature. In fact, I had almost unzipped a past project that would let me use iOS-style toggle switches when I had a crazy idea: what if I could give my phone a good <em>shake</em> to trigger a dark mode? Twenty minutes and <a href="https://github.com/lhagan/jquery.ios-shake">one GitHub project</a> later, I had a rudimentary beta working.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the evening tweaking shake sensitivity until it worked well enough on my iPhone to detect intentional shakes and disregard most unintentional ones resultant of normal usage; however, that left me with the much larger iPad to contend with. To make a long and tedious story short, I ended up using different settings depending on the device, which I differentiated using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10364620">a wonderfully simple trick I found on Stack Overflow</a>. From those who have checked out the beta, it works like a charm on both devices.</p>

<p>After finalizing this feature I made a few more small changes like centering headlines and prepending linked list items with a &#8220;&gt;&#8221; sign, but focused most of my efforts on optimizing performance. Leading up to my decision to finally bundle jQuery with every page, an unwillingness to increase load times served as my primary motivation behind eschewing Javascript of any kind: I wanted my site to respond quickly irregardless of device or internet speed. Bundling external scripts would increase latency, I reasoned, and I could not accept such a tradeoff. As I said though, I eventually overcame that aversion and started implementing some neat tricks here and there. In order to keep the associated performance hit at a minimum, I consolidated external files as much as possible, and minified everything. For example, using Javascript compressors like the <a href="http://jscompress.com/">Online Javascript Compression Tool</a>, I cut Bigfoot down to <a href="http://pastebin.com/yZ4xtwKe">1/3 its original file size</a>, and saw similar reductions in size&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, by extension, load times&#160;&#8212;&#160;in my other scripts and stylesheets as well. Now, with an empty cache and a fresh browser instance, it takes less than half a second to open my home page, and ~1 second to open my archives with more than four hundred entries. I can live with that.</p>

<p>Incredibly&#160;&#8212;&#160;to me, at least&#160;&#8212;&#160;I did all this yesterday in around twelve hours from start to finish, and spent today writing this before and after work. I cannot, nor do I mean to, take all the credit for this great turnaround time though: I could not have done it without the feedback of my Twitter followers giving me direction as to what I needed to work on next. In particular, I would like to say a special &#8220;Thank you!&#8221; to <a href="http://twitter.com/typistX">@typistX</a> on Twitter for all his help: when asked he took our conversation out of Twitter and in to email, where we made a great deal of progress. I could not have done this so quickly and to such splendid results without him, nor without the input of my newfound friends on Twitter. To all of you: thank you; to everyone else, I hope you enjoy the new design.</p>

<p>Like Casey Liss I did not particularly care for John Siracusa and Marco Arment&#8217;s incessant Mac Pro banter, but kept listening because I enjoy their thoughts and opinions so much. I found Marco&#8217;s latest post, however, where he explained why he believes we will not see a true Retina iMac-caliber display for quite some time, very interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;To bring Retina to the 27&rdquo; iMac and 27&rdquo; Thunderbolt Display, Apple doesn&#8217;t need to wait until 5120x2880 panels are available. They can launch them at the next-lowest common resolution and use software scaling to let people simulate it if they want, or display things slightly larger at perfect native resolution. ... That next resolution down, of course, is 4K.&#8221;</p>

As it turns out, I did the right thing: reading <em>The Hard Way</em> earlier this afternoon, it was as if I had written it myself. Linus covered all the points I would have and even told a story that could have just as easily fit my experience working to drive traffic towards my work.

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-09 08:58:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/09 08:58:31 EST</time>
<p>Last November, I barely managed to stay within my data limit: roughly halfway through, Verizon sent me a message saying that I had already reached 90<code> of my alloted bandwidth. Given that I had just recently decided to stream all of my music with iTunes Match rather than sync more than a thousand songs to a newly replaced iPhone, it should have come as no surprise. For the following two weeks I carefully metered my 3G usage, doing far less on my phone than usual; nevertheless, I soon hit 95</code> and, wanting to avoid an overage charge, stopped opening even images on Twitter off of WiFi. Thankfully, my billing cycle ended soon after that and I could start with a clean, music streaming-free slate.</p>

<p>That disconcerting, unfamiliar lack of freedom in today&#8217;s world where mediocre-speed cellular data connections have effectively removed the boundaries of location to consuming and producing content took away&#160;&#8212;&#160;albeit briefly&#160;&#8212;&#160;from my iPhone experience. For a while, I could use this mobile computer for nothing more than I would a prepaid phone; I did not buy an iPhone for such a use case. Unlike <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/att-sponsored-data-2/">Nilay Patel</a>, then, who sees AT&T&#8217;s Sponsored Data program as an evil to fight tooth and nail until it eventually, inevitably, becomes a reality, I see it&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/att-sponsored-data/">just as Shawn Blanc does</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;as one more way Apple and other large tech companies can improve their users&#8217; experience: perhaps Apple will subsidize music streaming costs for iTunes Match subscribers. If that means an extra $5, $10, or $15 a <em>year</em> over the paltry $20 I pay now, I am absolutely fine with that.</p>

<p>On the topic of AT&#38;T, before closing I would like to briefly note that while everyone seems to focus on Verizon when it comes to large American cellphone networks, the greatest innovations in this industry&#160;&#8212;&#160;think the first-generation iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;started with AT&#38;T. Perhaps because of where I live or the circles I travel in I see and hear of Verizon disproportionately more when compared to other parts of the country, but regardless it seems like rather than Verizon we ought to look towards AT&#38;T when trying to discern the future of the American mobile phone industry. Like the iPhone, Sponsored Date very well could revolutionize this market once again. Coming from AT&#38;T, it&#8217;s off to a good start.</p>

<p>Aside from Matt and Myke&#8217;s <a href="http://tearawaytrousers.com/73">recent</a> CES <a href="http://tearawaytrousers.com/74">discussions</a>, Mophie&#8217;s newest battery pack is by far the coolest thing I have seen come out of CES this year. When I upgrade to an iPhone 6 this fall, I plan to make this my second purchase: rather than go with the 32GB model, giving myself ample room to expand after only recently transitioning from an 8GB iPhone 4 to a 16GB 4S, buying the Space Pack I will save me $100 by allowing me to get the 16GB iPhone 6, which I can then use towards Mophie&#8217;s $150 case. Given that I would have bought a different case for somewhere in the neighborhood of $30, though, the Space Pack&#8217;s price will essentially be a wash in which I end up with a Juice Pack Air and the same storage capacity I would have otherwise.</p>

<p>Although published back in 2012, every day I come to realize the truth in Shawn Blanc&#8217;s words just a little bit more. Even if he does discount the vast majority of his own counsel as general life advice more applicable there than on one&#8217;s website, I believe he makes an unnecessary distinction in doing so: when you begin to take writing seriously and it ceases to be something you have to do and instead becomes something you not only want to do but <em>need</em> to do, it has transformed from a hobby to a way of life inextricably linked to the person you are today. At that point, both have become one and the same.</p>

<p>A characteristically excellent article by Horace Dediu of Asymco. Horace Dediu, Benedict Evans, and Ben Thompson constantly vie for the top spot as my favorite data-driven writer.

<p>Had I picked one paragraph or sentence as a pull quote from Ben Thompson&#8217;s <em>Chromebooks and the Cost of Complexity</em>, I would have done the rest of his article a great disservice by holding one fascinating line above another equally excellent passage. Having read Stratechery for a few months now, I can honestly say that out of all his articles, I consider this one by far and away his best.</p>

<p>Also of interest, Ben posted a followup piece earlier today titled <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/the-best-analogy-for-chromebooks-are-ipads/"><em>The Best Analogy for Chromebooks are iPads</em></a>, where he explained the use case of a Chromebook and its similarity to that of an iPad.

<p><a href="http://parislemon.com/post/72415950189/the-first-app-you-open-in-the-morning">A few days ago</a>, MG Siegler posited that the app you open first every day signals a great deal about both the current state of apps and your present state of mind. After posting <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-first-app-you-open-in-the-morning.html">my take</a>, I kept thinking. Eventually, I decided that even more telling than the app you launch first every day is the last app you open before bed every night.</p>

<p>After waking, most feel rejuvenated, full of energy, and ready to tackle the world. Or, at least, some lesser version of a single trait in that combination. Regardless of how capable you are upon waking at six, seven, or&#160;&#8212;&#160;as seems much more popular amongst writers&#160;&#8212;&#160;eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning though, we invariably feel much more able to handle problems and deal with potentially time consuming situations than when we have spent an hour winding down for bed in the evening. I open Instacast very early every morning, for example, yet the last thing I want to do as I lay in bed is commit to an hour-long&#160;&#8212;&#160;or thirty minute, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;show. Instead, I open Tweetbot, then Reeder, and then perhaps Zite if I have nothing else to do. These apps reflect my interests&#160;&#8212;&#160;my present state of mind&#160;&#8212;&#160;much more accurately than those I launch to begin the day, because when I lay tired in bed, the last thing I will put up with is any level of difficulty or stress.</p>

<p>In my early days as a fledgling internet writer, back when I posted at blog-that-shall-not-be-named-dot-provider-dot-com, I worked hard to increase my readership. Taking lessons from anyone willing to give them, I delved into WordPress.com&#8217;s fantastic blogging community and networked with other like-minded individuals. We read each others&#8217; articles, commented, and even planned to start a number of joint ventures together. Although in its infancy, even back in 2007 I also looked to drive traffic towards my work with podcast advertisements. As the years wore on I unfortunately moved away from these venues and on to Hacker News and Twitter, where I have remained to date with little to show for my efforts.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, in preparation for this post I decided to go back and check the stats for three &#8220;major&#8221; blogs I ran prior to this one. While others came even earlier and still more in between, three stood out as endeavors I put a significant amount of energy in to. I started the first on December 13th, 2007, published twenty-four articles over the next four months, and closed its doors on April 3rd, 2008. I did not, however, take it off the internet: it remains publicly available to this day. Since its founding, my first blog has attracted 919 views. Interestingly, 595 of those came after I stopped posting there. In other words, these articles&#160;&#8212;&#160;despite my general embarrassment at having ever published them&#160;&#8212;&#160;have incredible longevity.</p>

<p>On April 4th, 2008, I launched its successor. Wanting to keep my previous work intact, I imported my favorite articles from my past site and used them as a jumping-off point to give me something to work from. Two years and eight months later, after 144 posts, I shuttered this site as well on February 4th. Like the last, I did not completely close it down; today, its hit counter measures 24,871 views, 3,961 of which came after I stopped posting there.</p>

<p>Finally, I began my last blog prior to this one on February 22nd, 2011, and closed it six months later on September 19th after just 43 articles. Despite such a limited run when compared to its predecessor, this site garnered 8,095 views during the brief time period I posted new articles, and another 11,911 since I stopped publishing there, for a grand total of 20,006 views. For January of this year, its traffic&#160;&#8212;&#160;featuring content more than two years past its prime&#160;&#8212;&#160;is on par with my current blog where I write and post every single day. Incredible. &#8220;Astounded&#8221; does not even begin to describe my reaction to discovering all of this. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect such a turn of events, yet I could not argue with the graphs.</p>

<p>I had already settled on my consummate point when I set out to write this article; I just needed to decide how to get there. In service of this goal, I thought I would point to past failures as evidence of a flawed mantra preaching that hard work alone could guarantee eventual success. After all, I had tried this three times before and had yet to &#8220;succeed&#8221;; surely that meant the problem lie within the system rather than my own efforts. Ultimately, I planned to end on some permutation of this note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning you might have been a small fish just starting out, but the pond was incredibly small; now the pond is not only incredibly large, but there are also exponentially more small fish. You cannot move forward the same way with <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2014/01/03/on-the-future-of-the-internet-and-everything/">2.5 billion</a> internet users as you would with thousands or even hundreds of thousands.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a routine checkup turned to surprise as I found five digits where I expected three though, I had to stop and think: perhaps the solution to my problem of a relatively minor readership did not lie in pestering those already in possession of large followings&#160;&#8212;&#160;the inspiration for my title&#160;&#8212;&#160;and instead I ought to buckle down and work at this as I had nothing before. It had proved worthwhile in the past, after all; why not again?</p>

<p>Taking a quick break from my next article I will hopefully publish late tonight, <a href="http://twitter.com/johnvoorhees">John Voorhees</a> worked with Myke Hurley and Matt Alexander of <a href="http://5by5.tv/bionic">Bionic</a> to create Vlcnr 1.0. Featuring the show&#8217;s hallmark suspense accents one through eight and an easter egg that plays random clips from the show, I downloaded the app sight on seen. Not to steal <a href="https://twitter.com/mattalexand/status/420365381698461696">Matt&#8217;s idea</a>, but I have to say: I have been testing this app for quite some time now, it&#8217;s really great. Those of you unfamiliar with Bionic will likely think it ridiculous; for everyone else, might as well pack up and leave: 2014 has peaked.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-06 22:49:55-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/06 22:49:55 EST</time>
<p>Recently, I have started thinking seriously about monetizing this site. Although I could not command the same rate <a href="http://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/">John Gruber</a>, <a href="http://www.marco.org/sponsorship">Marco Arment</a>, or even <a href="http://www.macstories.net/sponsorships">Federico Viticci</a> does, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/who-to-follow-in-2014.html">nearly 3,500</a> unique visitors in 2013 has to count for something. Moreover, I plan to grow that number significantly throughout the coming year. The question remains, however, how I ought to go about doing that or, perhaps more saliently, how I should <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>With terrible ads so prevalent on the vast majority of sites and services today, I want to either do this well and in a respectful and attractive way or not at all. Some may criticize my &#8220;lack of foresight&#8221; in closing so many potential avenues with this mantra, but given that I run my site at a net loss every month, bringing my finances out of the red&#160;&#8212;&#160;no matter how minutely&#160;&#8212;&#160;would be a huge step forward. This rules out banner ads and sidebars; videos, GIFs, and any other media capable of automatically playing. I will not have these on my website. I would rather write hosting costs off as part of an ongoing hobby and continue losing money than pollute my carefully-crafted design with these abominations. Even though I cannot count myself amongst the ranks of designers, I did take pains to make this website look visually pleasing. I refuse to willfully destroy that experience.</p>

<p>Resultant of this goal I may even hesitate to host advertisements from <a href="http://decknetwork.net">The Deck</a> or <a href="http://fusionads.net">Fusion Ads</a>: I have never found the 120x90 or 130x100 pixel image ad bucking a site&#8217;s crafted aesthetic in any way attractive, or anything less than jarring. That said though, both networks were created by geeks for geeks and only promote quality products on premiere websites. Given the chance, I would have to seriously consider the opportunity to become a part of such a respected agency.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, I want the majority of my revenue to come from a combination of sponsored blog posts, an email newsletter or two, memberships, and two daily podcasts: one strictly for members resembling <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/members/">Shawn Today</a>, and another version of the show open to the public but with ad spots throughout. When writing about sponsors, I would likely do little to differentiate myself from others posting similar short articles. However, changing the status quo with regards to this form of advertising is an attractive prospect, so I will keep thinking about it.</p>

<p>As for email newsletters, I had two types in mind when I began thinking about starting my own. Ideally, mine would resemble the best aspects of Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/newsletter/">Newsletter of Wonderful Things</a> and Brett Terpstra&#8217;s <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/topic/bookmarks/">Web Excursions</a>, where the latter occasionally sends out a list of cool projects he has come across, interesting articles, and neat websites, while the former does so with a similar focus much more regularly. After stumbling across Soctt&#8217;s Newsletter of Wonderful Things a year or two ago, it quickly became my most anticipated to email. Similarly, I accidentally found Brett&#8217;s Web Excursions after quite a few episodes of his podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic">Systematic</a>, and have read every one since then. I would populate my version of these two newsletters with similar items culled from the expansive list of sites and articles I do not post to my blog either out of a reluctance to publish something silly, or because I cannot find a way to tie it in with the overarching narrative I strive to constantly write in service of furthering.</p>

<p>Antithetical to the first, I would model my second after Benedict Evans&#8217;s weekly <a href="http://ben-evans.com/newsletter/">Mobile Newsletter</a>. Every Sunday, Benedict sends out a short email where he lists his latest articles and goes over interesting news in mobile and tech from the past week. He then goes on to highlight a number of worthwhile articles, followed by new industry data points. Since starting this site I have wanted to publish a weekly retrospective, and this format would finally allow me to do so. After my own blog posts, an industry news segment could contain my take on topics I find interesting yet not compelling enough to publish as a standalone piece. Anything of which I have too little to say and thus deign not to post to my website that also does not fit into my version of Scott&#8217;s Newsletter of Wonderful Things would find a home in the &#8220;Worthwhile Blog Posts&#8221; section, where a simple link alongside a short description would suffice. Given my disinclination towards large data, I would likely skip the &#8220;Data Points&#8221; portion in all but the rarest of cases. I will gladly leave that sort of work to the likes of Horace Dediu and Benedict Evans.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration for a membership strategy from <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/members/">Shawn Blanc</a> and <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/membership/">Jim Dalrymple</a>, readers could subscribe and receive a number of perks such as an ad-free podcast where I talk about recent news, topics floating around in my head, articles in various stages of completion, and any current projects I may have endeavored to begin. Members would also receive beta access to any of those unfinished projects, allowing them to follow along with my progress and struggles detailed on the podcast and experienced firsthand through early access. I would also offer a truncated RSS feed for anyone opposed to the full-text default feed. Some may prefer it, generating it takes but a few extra lines of code, so I might as well.</p>

<p>I may also decide to restrict one of the previously described newsletters to members only. As for which one, I cannot say for sure yet; however, I like the idea of offering one great resource to everyone and using another, comparable one to give those on the fence one more reason to subscribe. Most importantly though, as Jim Dalrymple explains on his membership page, &#8220;...by becoming a member, you will be supporting our efforts to bring unique, well-written content to the site. Writing for The Loop is a labor of love for us, but it&#8217;s also our business and how we feed our families.&#8221; I could not have said it better. This is an extremely important reality that I would hammer home relentlessly because at the end of the day, I wager the vast majority of people subscribe for that reason alone.</p>

<p>Finally, I may also choose to explore other monetization strategies. For example, an RSS-only sponsorship completely separate from the main site&#8217;s. While a divorced promotion such as this could prove unsuccessful for too little tangible interest or too much additional work on my side, or both, I believe websites have two distinct readerships&#160;&#8212;&#160;those who actually visit the site and those who subscribe in RSS&#160;&#8212;&#160;and thus ought to target those channels separately. Tertiary strategies aside, though, and with a good set of plans in place, I must no longer answer the question of how or how not to start making money from this website, but <em>when</em> I will begin doing so. With <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/393053146/powerup-30-smartphone-controlled-paper-airplane?ref=popular">Kickstarter on my mind</a>, I decided to implement a similar rollout plan:</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="20VisitorsaDay">20 Visitors a Day<span>&nbsp;<a href="#20VisitorsaDay">#</a></span></h2>

<p>I currently see, on average, ten unique pageviews every day. When that number doubles, I will begin publishing a Newsletter of Wonderful Things- and Web Excursions-inspired newsletter, as described above, once a month.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Bonusgoal">Bonus goal: 30 Visitors a Day<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Bonusgoal">#</a></span></h3>

<p>At thirty unique views each day, I will increase the frequency at which I publish my newsletter to once every other week.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="1000VisitorsaMonth">1000 Visitors a Month<span>&nbsp;<a href="#1000VisitorsaMonth">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Those of you adept at math will recognize the jump from &#8220;30 Visitors a Day&#8221; to &#8220;1000 Visitors a Month&#8221; as the relatively minor increase of approximately 100 pageviews that it is. However, I needed a crossover point, and after 1000 representing audience goals on a per-day basis became infeasible. At one thousand visitors per month, I will start publishing the second, more data-driven newsletter, available to all.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="2000VisitorsaMonth">2000 Visitors a Month<span>&nbsp;<a href="#2000VisitorsaMonth">#</a></span></h2>

<p>I will seek out sponsorships.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="BonusGoal">Bonus Goal: 2100 Visitors a Month<span>&nbsp;<a href="#BonusGoal">#</a></span></h3>

<p>At just over 2080 unique monthly pageviews I will cross over the 25,000 per year mark. When this happens, I will start accepting memberships.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="2500VisitorsaMonth">2500 Visitors a Month<span>&nbsp;<a href="#2500VisitorsaMonth">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Upon reaching this point, I will make all of my code projects available for members to access. Although I will continue improving each project, members will be free to do with each as they see fit.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="3000VisitorsaMonth">3000 Visitors a Month<span>&nbsp;<a href="#3000VisitorsaMonth">#</a></span></h2>

<p>At three thousand visitors a month, I will start a members-only podcast, and begin releasing an ad-supported version for everyone else to listen to.</p>

<p>After reaching a monthly audience of 3000 people, I plan to come back and evaluate my progress and set future goals. At this point, that number seems like a pipe dream; how could I possibly plan any further?</p>

<p>I intentionally spread these goals out over a wide range in order to gradually increase my workload over the course of several months. However, I would <em>love</em> to find myself scrambling after blowing past one, two, maybe even three goals in a relatively short period of time. Please, surprise me: as much as I want to expand my audience and begin making some money here, I really want the challenge of meeting my readers&#8217; expectations and sticking to the hard and fast timeline I set out for myself. To me, this is not just about making a few dollars: this is about growing a sustainable business I can reap a respectable livelihood from, something that I can only accomplish by doing monetization well. I think I have a rock-solid plan in that regard; now I just need the visitors.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Benedict Evans in <a href="http://cubed.fm/2013/12/cubed-episode-12-mobile-musings-for-2014/">episode twelve</a> of Cubed, around 12:20, Samsung has the talent, resources, and funds to mass produce any type of hardware, and so they substitute taste and design sense with covering all possible bases in order to determine successful product lines. Apple only recently accrued the former, so up until a few years ago they operated solely on taste and design sense. Now that they have the scale to adopt a similar strategy as Samsung though, they see no point in implementing a lesser process having already perfected the greater one Samsung developed a methodology to emulate. This is the fundamental difference between the ways Samsung and Apple build products: one carefully selects its targets, while the other uses a blunderbuss to obliterate the target, its stand, and anything within a close range. Ultimately both accomplish the requisite goal, only one does so more elegantly and with much fewer casualties.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5C, however, has turned out to match much more closely with a Samsung-like development mantra, not necessarily on purpose, but by virtue of Apple not pushing the device far enough in its intended direction. John Siracusa spoke to the shortcomings of Apple&#8217;s budget iPhone to completely fulfill its purported role during <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/46-a-compromised-machine">episode forty-six</a> of the Accidental Tech Podcast. In <a href="http://www.wholeandpart.com/now/2014/1/3/viticci-on-leaving-google-chrome">Zac Cichy-esque fashion</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[12:03] &#8220;The 5C is a little bit disappointing in that it&#8217;s not more different. My whole thing was that if you make a purpose-built, cheaper phone, you can do it better than simply offering last year&#8217;s model. And they kind of did that, I guess, by going with plastic and stuff and maybe putting in a little bit bigger battery, but otherwise it&#8217;s basically just an iPhone 5 in there, and I feel like there&#8217;s an untapped potential in a purpose-built, second-tier iPhone. So maybe their next run at it they&#8217;ll do a little bit better, but we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidently, John believes Apple will take another stab at capturing the mobile phone market&#8217;s low end. Given the 5C&#8217;s rather unremarkable performance and its continued perception as a premiere, high-end device, all indications seem to point in such a direction. Apple has yet to fill the gap many believed it set out to patch over with the 5C; namely, the gap between mid- to high-end Android phones and the latest iPhone. They have successfully increased margins on last year&#8217;s phone even further than time naturally does, and simultaneously made it an attractive option. Having established the &#8220;C&#8221; line no less than its &#8220;S&#8221; counterpart, Apple can now shift focus further down market.</p>

<p>At a high level, we may draw a parallel to the manner in which Samsung develops successful product lines: with the 5C, Apple made relatively minor changes&#160;&#8212;&#160;as compared to those it could have&#160;&#8212;&#160;to its iPhone line. With another, possibly truly budget iPhone it will make relatively minor changes once again&#160;&#8212;&#160;as compared to those of the 5C, although when held alongside the iPhone 6 the modifications necessary for a truly budget iPhone will stand out in starker contrast&#160;&#8212;&#160;in order to finally address the low end with a true second-tier phone, purpose-built for that market rather than repackaged from last year&#8217;s technology. These incremental modifications are not unlike the process Samsung uses to saturate the mobile phone industry with every conceivable form factor until something proves mildly successful, albeit on a much smaller, more polished scale. Nevertheless, the parallel is worth pointing out if even as nothing more than a thought exercise.</p>

<p>Getting back to the topic at hand though, in simpler terms Apple has systematically begun moving towards the low end. Had the iPhone 5C exceeded expectations and managed to capture the entire mid- to high-end Android market, there would be no need for a true budget iPhone built specifically for that price point; however, it &#8220;failed&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use the term lightly here, for it obviously succeeded in a number of areas as described above&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that market still exists, waiting, tantalizingly underserved. Perhaps rather than ask &#8220;If&#8221; Apple will address this need with an intentionally second-tier offering instead of retrofitting last year&#8217;s model, we ought to ask &#8220;When&#8221; such a device will reach the market.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-05 15:08:50-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/05 15:08:50 EST</time>
<p>Thinking Brett Terpstra had expanded nvALT into an iOS counterpart, I opened Chris Gonzales&#8217;s post on Tools &#38; Toys reviewing <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/nvnotes-for-iphone/">nvNotes for iPhone</a> curious to see what he had made and his justifications for such a move. To my surprise, the only relation nvNotes has to either Notational Velocity or nvALT lies in inspiration: created by Nicholas Clapp, it takes cues from both aforementioned apps in its utilitarian aesthetic and strong feature set. Despite its many benefits though, nvNotes&#8217; infancy in relation to the likes of Drafts unfortunately shines through in many areas.</p>

<p>Immediately obvious from both Chris&#8217;s review and its <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nvnotes-note-taking-writing/id700659300?mt=8&at=10l7j8">page on the App Store</a>, nvNotes supports syntax highlighting. Although I rarely write anything long enough for such a feature to prove more than occasionally useful on my iPhone, its inclusion nevertheless interested me. Perhaps with the appropriate toolkit, I reasoned, I might spend more time writing on my iPhone or, at the very least, experiment enough to know for sure that such a workflow did not fit me. Coupled with handy word and character counts, a nifty Markdown keyboard row reminiscent of Drafts&#8217; similar feature in its iPad version, Dropbox integration&#160;&#8212;&#160;a must&#160;&#8212;&#160;and support for URL schemes, nvNotes made itself out as the perfect note-taking app. Unfortunately, $2.99 later I had nothing to show for my enthusiasm but mild disappointment.</p>

<p>At first glance nvNotes rivals Drafts in simplicity of visual aesthetic. When launched, the interface contains only three elements: a nondescript text field to add or search for notes, a label indicating the absence of any documents, and a gear representing the settings screen. I began by linking nvNotes to my Dropbox account, after which I started exploring other settings: display order, default font, theme, and auto night mode. Finished there, I began running into problems when trying to create my first note: I typed a title into the appropriate area, tapped the large body area that should have allowed me to add more content, and waited. Nothing. Turns out one can only add a new entry after picking a title and then hitting &#8220;Next&#8221; on the keyboard, at which point nvNotes will permit you to finish typing; forgetting that, nvNotes will retain this string in its uppermost box, preventing you from adding a new item until figuring out the requisite combination of taps, swipes, and pulls necessary to successfully instantiate a new item. If I wanted to name every entry, I would use Dropbox and write solely in plaintext files. I need fewer barriers to putting my thoughts to words, not more, and so in this regard I found nvNotes lacking.</p>

<p>An appropriate title fleshed out and finally with a blank canvas before me, I started typing only to have my efforts confounded by a disturbing lack of capitalization. For some reason, nvNotes capitalizes neither the first letter in a line nor sentence automatically. As a self-respecting writer, I found myself at an impasse: struggle against muscle memory reinforced with every other iOS app I have ever used, or swallow the bitter pill of improper capitalization haunting every idea I record. Neither a particularly attractive prospect, I cannot understand why any developer would choose to buck such an ingrained feature as this. Unfortunately, nvNotes&#8217;s poor design and disregard for the status quo does not stop there: the app also does not allow users to swipe away the keyboard. Instead, you must use of the unlabeled&#160;&#8212;&#160;and in some cases inscrutable&#160;&#8212;&#160;buttons only visible if the extended Markdown keyboard is not. It took several unsuccessful attempts pawing at the screen&#160;&#8212;&#160;like an animal&#160;&#8212;&#160;to discover this unconventional behavior. This same row contains the syntax highlighting option, curiously masquerading as a preview button of sorts.</p>

<p>After the last two rants, I have disappointingly little to say regarding this feature: it works reasonably well until you try to use Zen mode on any sentence but the most recent, in which case it, frustratingly, moves the cursor back to the bottommost line every time. Perhaps one could make the case for only allowing users to focus on their most recent line when using Zen mode given the mantra it derived its name from, but I would err on the side of bad design instead.</p>

<p>Decidedly tired of nvNotes and its quirks by now, unparalleled support for URL schemes was the app&#8217;s last bastion of hope. If I could build even better URL schemes and file actions with nvNotes than Drafts, I may have considered using it more regularly despite its numerous shortcomings. When I tapped the &#8220;Share&#8221; button though, the hallmark square with an upward-pointing arrow, I found four options: &#8220;Message&#8221;, &#8220;Mail&#8221;, &#8220;Twitter&#8221;, and &#8220;Copy&#8221;. In a word, underwhelming&#160;&#8212;&#160;both this standard share sheet and the app as a whole.</p>

<p>Reading through Ben Bajarin&#8217;s <a href="http://techpinions.com/what-i-love-about-apples-strategy/26240">recent article on Tech.pinions</a>, it reminded me of the incredible disparity between those who inhabit the Apple sphere and regular people with regards to knowledge of Apple&#8217;s intended direction. This lack of understanding leads uninitiated reporters and laypeople alike to frame Apple in the same way they would a much more familiar business such as Target or Walmart: one expands into groceries, the other follows suit; Samsung makes bigger phones, Apple must do so as well in order to survive. Such wildly off-base associations stem from this apathetic incomprehension and betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the very different ways these two companies design products, yet those same people who cannot grasp these truths we hold to be self-evident nevertheless feel compelled to write their trite opinions concerning Apple&#8217;s future. I cannot understand why anyone spends time discussing those articles.</p>

<p>Last month I wrote about the <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/incredibly-high-level-discourse.html">incredibly high levels of discourse</a> Apple watchers enjoy as a community, where I pointed out that while we speculated as to whether the iPhone 6 would ship with sapphire glass, many continue to wonder if Apple will even make another iPhone. This community enjoys such widespread aptitude and intelligence that we both forget how little everyone outside our privileged bubble knows about this industry we follow so closely and jump on anyone purporting to be one of us who goes out on a limb to propose something divergent from the widely accepted narrative. In saying all that I did not mean to justify or defend the ridiculous, completely unfounded rumors invariably preluding a major hardware release, but to suggest that we perhaps recognize the good thing we have for the exceptionally high standard it is, and back down, if even slightly, from the notion that one must always make correct predictions.</p>

<p>More important than focusing introspectively on aspects one could only arguably categorize as issues within this thriving community though, I feel we ought not hold those either on the fringes or completely removed from this circle to such grueling standards as we may one of our own. Whereas John Siracusa&#8217;s <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/02/02/apples-2013-to-do-list">predictions</a> and eventual <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2014/01/02/apples-2013-scorecard">retrospections</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/apples-2013-scorecard.html">do deserve scrutiny</a>, do Value Walk&#8217;s? I say no: while we still should not make allowances for shoddy reporting and inept writing, excusing poor work because someone unfamiliar with our culture and the status quo wrote it, poking fun at such articles serves no wholesome purpose. In this respect we may take a cue from app reviewers who, when criticized for only publishing about apps that &#8220;they have been testing out for a while and really like&#8221;, questioned why anyone would write a negative review with such an incredible number of amazing apps clamoring for their attention. I feel such a mentality would go a long way towards improving the underlying narrative within the Apple community: rather than wax on about the entertaining ramblings you find ultimately useless, try ignoring that work and instead focus on your own, because I guarantee you still have room for improvement. Ironically, &#8220;disparity&#8221; and &#8220;disparagement&#8221; are two words just one incorrect conjugation apart.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-bitcoin-will-plummet.html">I linked to</a> an article by Tyler Cowen where he made a strong case for Coin&#8217;s inevitable devaluation as a currency, citing the ease with which one could create a cryptocurrency potentially superior to Bitcoin as the catalyst that will push its value further and further down from the high it currently enjoys. Ironically, today a new service made its way into the top ten on Hacker News called Coinage Beta, which allows anyone to create their own alternative currency by filling out a form and paying a nominal fee.</p>

<p>Let the proliferation of Bitcoin alternatives begin. I look forward to seeing how this affects the Bitcoin market, if at all. Tyler could not have posted his article at a better time.</p>

<p>As Marco said in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/01/01/anandtech-2013-mac-pro-review">his post</a> linking to AnandTech&#8217;s new Mac Pro evaluation, &#8220;For Mac OS reviews, read John Siracusa. For Mac reviews, read Anand.&#8221; This has become widely accepted over the last few years, and rightly so: these two writers epitomize every aspect of excellence within their respective fields. That&#8217;s why I sat down with AnandTech&#8217;s latest article, despite having no intention of buying a Mac Pro within the foreseeable future. After Marco&#8217;s recommendation I originally intended to focus solely on page two, but before I knew it Anand had sucked me in and I ended up finishing the entire piece.</p>

<p>During <a href="http://neutral.fm">Neutral&#8217;s</a> brief run John made an interesting point in their discussion of the latest Ferrari supercar which, I believe, took place during <a href="http://neutral.fm/episodes/8-three-james-mays">episode eight</a>: car companies traditionally focused on mid-range to low-end price points nevertheless devote significant time and money to building incredibly powerful vehicles&#160;&#8212;&#160;some of which never even make it to market&#160;&#8212;&#160;in order to push the boundaries of the automotive industry and showcase the extremes of their abilities as engineers, designers, and manufacturers. In the computing world, Apple&#8217;s Mac Pro fulfills a similar role in epitomizing the juxtaposition of power, usability, and design. To shift focus briefly back to cars, high-end car companies like BMW and Audi charge a premium for craftsmanship and luxury, yes, but also for the latest vehicular technology available that more economical cars will not see for years to come. To predict the future of the low end, one need only look to the current high end: within a few generations that technology will trickle down to the economy classes, replaced with even more impressive features, and so the cycle will repeat itself. We may draw another parallel to the Mac Pro here as the signifier of impending change to not only Apple&#8217;s other computing devices over the next few years, but the computing industry as a whole resultant of Apple&#8217;s relatively new position as today&#8217;s most popular tech company. Therein lies my reasoning behind setting aside an hour or so to read Anand&#8217;s article and put this short post together: while I do not plan on buying a Mac Pro, it serves as an excellent indicator of where the high end is headed, and thus sets a reasonable expectation for the next few years with regards to not only CPU performance, but every other aspect as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;All of this leads to the question; is there any company more successful at controlling the public narrative than Amazon? Nothing it cares about ever leaks. Almost all of the press coverage, even the negative stories, runs to a script that Bezos could have written&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8216;We do amazing things to get low prices to customers&#8217; and &#8216;it&#8217;s incredibly hard to compete with us&#8217;. Of course, both of those things may well be true.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone loves to praise Apple as the most interesting company in existence, building the greatest products available, showcased with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/misunderstood.html">the best marketing</a> in the business. Conversely, everyone loves to hate Amazon: they never do anything interesting and consistently &#8220;fail&#8221; to turn a profit; their products consistently fall far short of even the most reasonable expectations; and the company operates essentially as a black box. I find it incredibly interesting, then, when a writer goes to bat for Amazon. The companies are not all that different, after all.</p>

<p>Marco Arment in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/29/smart-watches-and-face-computers"><em>Smart Watches and Computers On Your Face</em></a>, after explaining technology&#8217;s inexorable progression since the 1980s, went on to posit that perhaps our current devices have reached the point of &#8220;good enough&#8221; with the advent of current-generation smartphones and, in some use cases, tablets; perhaps, at this point, further &#8220;innovation&#8221; with products such as Google Glass and a smart watch of sorts serves little purpose, because mobile phones have become so good as of late to obviate the need for more devices of arguable value. Although I tend to agree with him, I do so with a tremendous amount of reserve.</p>

<p>Prior to Apple&#8217;s iPhone launch you could have asked any intelligent individual whether the mobile handset industry had room for improvement, and no one would have produced a list detailing every aspect the iPhone went on to gain widespread acclaim for. Most agreed this industry needed change, but the perception of technology as &#8220;good enough&#8221; prevented them from seeing anything but a small portion of the full picture Steve Jobs revealed with the iPhone. Up to that point, no one had a frame of reference that would have revealed an iPhone as the be-all end-all device that would set into motion the events that quickly brought us to the technologically advanced state we find ourselves now.</p>

<p>Today, we have reached a similar point: although no one in the right mind would argue against the need for further improvement, no one has successfully articulated what that necessary change will look like. Some have tried, hence Google Glass and Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Gear, but either no one has stumbled across this grand vision yet or someone already has and we simply have yet to see it. Either way, I hesitate to limit myself as everyone did in the pre-iPhone days. Just as happened back then, I expect the net major revolution in technology will come out of nowhere, from deep in left field. No one will expect it, and once again our lives will be forever changed.</p>

<p>Sitting here trying to decide the best way to fulfill <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/i-dont-write-for-pageviews.html">my goals for this website</a>, I found Nathan Barry&#8217;s post&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, subsequently, his past &#8220;year in review&#8221; updates&#160;&#8212;&#160;simultaneously inspiring and disheartening all at once. On the one hand, we have an amazing success story: after quitting his job Nathan has nearly doubled his salary every year, to say nothing for his readership and all his other impressive accomplishments; on the other hand, though, more than a year has passed since I started this website and I cannot consistently attract twenty pageviews a day. Needless to say, I make nothing for the countless hours I devote to this profession. No matter how much I want to take this from a nights and weekend hobby to a full-time venture, I have no choice but to keep waking up each morning and driving off to work.</p>

<p>What an awesome vehicle. Not only does it look great, it drives exceptionally well too, and can handle quite literally any terrain thrown at it. It&#8217;s a pity, then, to see such a rugged, utilitarian SUV like this one fade away only to have a more stylish, inarguably less capable one replace it. How disappointing.</p>

<p>I predicted this a while ago in an IRC conversation during a 5by5 broadcast, and many jumped at me for criticizing the practice of promoting one&#8217;s business on Facebook. To be fair, I made this statement prematurely: it took Facebook another year or two to actually begin diminishing their position as a viable source of attention. Now, though, I cannot say that this development surprises me in the least.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-01 19:48:38-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/01 19:48:38 EST</time>
<p>Earlier this week Matt Gemmell posted <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/who-to-read-in-2014/"><em>Who to Read in 2014</em></a>, where he pointed out ten writers and explained why he felt everyone should pay attention to their work in the upcoming year. At the end of his post, after listing his five favorite articles from the last twelve months, he called on other writers to provide their version of this list. Never one to back down from a challenge, I have done so with a bit of a twist: in addition to the individuals I believe everyone should follow in 2014, I also included a section devoted to people I believe we ought to stop reading before providing a collection of my own favorite works.</p>

<p>As Matt did I will begin with the individuals you likely already follow, ordered alphabetically by last name. Some of these writers, like John Gruber, I have read for quite some time; others, like Benedict Evans, I did not become conscious of until much more recently. Regardless of how long I have known of them though, everyone on this list brings unique insight, experience, and personality to the table. If, somehow, you do not already follow their work, I strongly encourage you do so; make it your New Year&#8217;s resolution if you must.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com">Jim Dalrymple</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jdalrymple">@jdalrymple</a> on Twitter. While Jim and his cohorts maintain an rapid rate of publication ensuring his audience never wants for something to read, that breakneck pace sometimes comes at the price of quality: unlike other websites, I do not find every article published to The Loop interesting, and so I often skip posts there. Instead, I subscribe to The Loop because Jim and his writers have their finger on the pulse of the internet: if something happens, I know they will write about it. More importantly though, Jim has a fantastic track record confirming and disproving Apple rumors with his hallmark &#8220;Yep&#8221; and &#8220;Nope&#8221; responses. He has yet to be wrong.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.asymco.com">Horace Dediu</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco">@asymco</a> on Twitter. Benjamin Jackson said it best in <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminjackson/status/418029019507204096">a tweet on New Year&#8217;s eve</a>: &#8220;Pretty sure I learned more valuable info in the last year by closely following @asymco than I learned in every other school combined&#8221;. I could not agree more: Horace Dediu provides the best, most in-depth analysis I have ever seen on a variety of topics. Like someone once said of John Siracusa in reference to his <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical podcast</a>, Horace seems to have an incredible ability to become a more knowledgeable expert in any area of his choosing seemingly overnight than I could hope to achieve in a lifetime of study. His work is truly impressive and only rivaled by a select few.</li>
<li><a href="http://ben-evans.com">Benedict Evans</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans">@BenedictEvans</a> on Twitter. Although his blog does not receive the daily outpouring Jim&#8217;s does&#160;&#8212;&#160;but honestly, who else posts that much?&#160;&#8212;&#160;when he does publish a new article Benedict Evans consistently provides valuable insight on interesting topics. Even more so than his blog though, I would argue that Benedict thrives on Twitter where he uses the medium to pose some of the most intriguing, thought-provoking questions and insightful remarks I have ever read in less than 140 characters.</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">@gruber</a> on Twitter. For all the hate John regularly receives, whether for his tendency to diverge into discussions on baseball or his habit of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/12/the_year_in_apple_and_technology">calling it like he sees it</a>, you cannot make an argument against his credibility nor the intelligence of his opinions, both born of more than a decade in this industry. John Gruber ranks among the most respected Apple pundits for a very good reason.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macstories.net">Federico Viticci</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">@viticci</a> on Twitter. Runner-up for the latest addition to writers I follow, Federico Viticci regularly amazes both me and the internet at large with his incredible work on the iPad for which there is no parallel. He then uses this proficiency to produce some of the greatest app reviews I have ever read. If ever I wonder whether my iPad can handle a job, I look to Federico because I know that if this device can handle it, he will already have a system worked out for the task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, my list of people who you probably do not already follow, but should; people who have excelled in their respective professions in 2013, and look to do so once again in the coming year to fantastic&#160;&#8212;&#160;and even disruptive&#160;&#8212;&#160;results.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/shawnblanc">@shawnblanc</a> on Twitter. Although Matt counts Shawn as a writer who everyone likely already follows, I still remember the days before Shawn had taken his blog full-time, back when this world existed in the periphery of his conscience. Perhaps that colors my judgment, because Shawn has long-since dove headfirst into this work from home, internet writer lifestyle. Today he not only updates his blog regularly, but also runs the gadget site <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net">Tools &#38; Toys</a> and the Wirecutter of iOS and Mac websites, <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com">The Sweet Setup</a>. Shawn continues to impress with every venture he takes on. If you don&#8217;t pay close enough attention, his next might just pass you by.</li>
<li><a href="http://mykehurley.net">Myke Hurley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/imyke">@imkye</a> on Twitter. Formerly the sole proprietor of his own podcast network 70Decibels and now a host at 5by5, Myke Hurley has made some fascinating advancements in this industry throughout 2013, as I am sure he will continue to do in 2014 with his ever-expanding roster of shows. With any luck Myke will take his passion for podcasts full-time this year, allowing him to focus fully on furthering this medium. Good luck to you, good sir; we all have very high hopes for you.</li>
<li><a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/themenubar">@themenubar</a> on Twitter. I debated as to whether I wanted an entity rather than an individual for this entry in my &#8220;people who you probably do not already follow, but should&#8221; list, but I could not justify either Zac Cichy or Andrew Clark, one or the other, because in both cases I would have highlighted their work with The Menu Bar as justification for my choice. Although relatively new to the podcasting industry with just thirty-five episodes over seven months under their belt, its current state satisfies neither Zac nor Andrew. In 2014 I will also keep a close eye on the pair&#8217;s work not only with their show but in other venues as well, waiting in eager anticipation for the changes I have confidence they will be the genesis of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Matt I did not have five people for this list, and rather than finding two others to fill out the empty spots I chose to maintain the integrity of this grouping and leave it at the first three individuals that came to mind. Also unlike Matt&#8217;s article, I decided to include one more set of entries pointing out popular writers who I feel we ought to cease paying attention to for one reason or another. Because rather than suggest you become more familiar with their work I will instead advise you disassociate yourselves with them, I will neither include a website link nor a Twitter handle.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Verge. When The Verge first came out I wanted to love it, and eventually I did: it bucked all the trends and reported only on news I wanted to hear about. For a while, everyone idolized Josh Topolsky&#8217;s site, and for good reason. More recently, however, The Verge has continued a slow descent towards devolving into the very monolithic news organizations it set out to disrupt, and I find that incredibly disappointing. Today I unsubscribed from The Verge, and I suggest you do the same.</li>
<li>Ben Brooks. I started following Ben Brooks right around the same time I added Shawn Blanc&#8217;s website to my RSS reader. I enjoyed The B&#38;B Podcast, and both sites mirrored the topics Shawn and Ben frequently discussed on their show. Now, though, eleven months after that show ended, Ben has become much too curmudgeonly for my liking. I understand that this personality is part of his shtick, bit it has gone too far. His writing no longer has the polish it used to: instead of thoughtful pieces, his articles, as Harry Marks pointed out in a recent episode of The Menu Bar, read as a stream of conscience with just enough editing to remove the typos. Lately his writing looks less like a labor born of love, and more like an exercise in anger in vulgarity. Enough is enough; I am finished.</li>
</ul>

<p>On that dour note, we have finally come to this year&#8217;s articles I feel most proud of. In preparation for this section I had to go through everything I published in the last twelve months. To put it frankly, they embarrassed me; I barely made it through: I had such disappointment for so many of the posts I came across that I nearly abandoned this venture altogether. Luckily, I remembered the words of a wise writer who once told me that if you do not feel some shame when looking back at past works, you have failed to grow. Hesitantly secure in this knowledge, I pressed onward and found a number of pieces I can share here with pride. So many, in fact, that I have twice the number of entries Matt did in his post. However, whereas Matt felt each of his selections stood &#8220;as a strong example of my current writing, and has some measure of truth, insight and emotional resonance&#8221;, three of the ten mark an important point in the development of both my website and myself as a writer, and I had such fun putting the other two together I could not help but include them. In those five&#8217;s absence, then, I have five left over, just as Matt did, that I feel epitomize the best aspects of the last year spent writing.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-128gb-ipad-4.html">The 128GB iPad 4</a>. Here I decided that, rather than another linkblog, I wanted something more for this website: I wanted it to be extraordinary.</li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/i-dont-write-for-pageviews.html">I Don&#8217;t Write for Pageviews</a>. Shortly thereafter, I explained why I write at all.</li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/retrospectively-thankful.html">Retrospectively Thankful</a>. Much more recently, I have finally grown to appreciate the time and effort my English teachers in particular, although my other teachers as well, put in to force me to become proficient at this task I so love now.</li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeons-experiment.html">Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</a>. The only thing I enjoyed more than watching Avatar: The Last Airbender was writing this article about it and its sequel, The Legend of Korra. Rife with symbolism and parallels to the real world throughout its history, these two shows made for a fascinating in-depth examination. Out of all the long-form pieces I posted last year, I had the most fun with this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/book-two-spirits.html">Book Two: Spirits</a>. Here due to its counterpart&#8217;s deserved place as the piece I had the most fun writing in 2013, I also enjoyed this follow up article and the opportunity it gave me to once again examine the fascinating undertones present throughout The Legend of Korra.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/personality.html">Personality: Just another Excuse for Poor Writing</a>. For quite some time in an attempt at incorporating &#8220;personality&#8221; into my work, I excused poor writing as a necessary evil. Thankfully, I eventually came to my senses.</li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/im-buying-a-mac.html">Alright Tim, I&#8217;m Buying a Mac</a>. The pivotal moment when, during Apple&#8217;s WWDC 2013 keynote address as Tim Cook demoed iOS 7 for an audience of stricken developers and tech writers, I decided I would buy a Mac.</li>

<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html">Podcasting State of the Union</a>. The latter half of 2013 saw a great deal of discussion regarding the current state of podcasts and their future as a viable medium. I added my two cents, and many agreed with me.</li>
<li><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-case-for-3x.html">The Case for 3x</a>. Months later Ben Brooks reignited the controversy, and I once again weighed in with my thoughts and opinions.</li>
</ul>

<p>All complaints aside, because even if I do consider many of my posts terrible it does show growth that I could point to some proudly, 2013 proved a great year for both this website and my career as a writer. 3,356 unique visitors generated 4,416 visits and 7,902 pageviews. I know enough to realize the insignificance of these numbers compared to even Benedict Evans&#8217; newsletter, fast approaching ten thousand subscribers, but I still had more than three <em>thousand</em> people come to read my work. Talk about humbling. That blows my mind.</p>

<p>So raise a glass to another great year, this one even better than the last. Perhaps this is the naivety of youth speaking, but I feel like 2014 will go down in history as a pivotal year for many of the industries we all rely on every day. Industries will change as will the definitions of what it means to inhibit them, all the while I hope to get just a bit better at what I do here. Stay tuned in 2014, everyone: it will be a big year for all of us.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2014-01-01 11:11:13-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2014.html">2014</a>/<a href="/blog/2014-01.html">01</a>/01 11:11:13 EST</time>
<p>A collection of my favorite cabins from <a href="http://cabinporn.com">Cabin Porn</a> and other similar sites, beginning with <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/68806432681">The Watershed</a>. A seventy-square-foot building in the woods of Oregon specifically designed as a writer&#8217;s retreat, I love the idea of a small, designated area set apart in which to conduct one&#8217;s most personal work. Although given the type of articles I traditionally post I feel such an environment would not be particularly conducive to my writing, but that said I would still love to try such a thing. Perhaps some day.</p>

<p>Next in line we have an <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/69005844396/turf-a-frame-in-ansen-netherlands">A-frame built of turf in the Netherlands</a>. If I didn&#8217;t know better I would call this out as a scale model: for some reason it has that unreal vibe to it. But then again, so many of these cabins seem almost otherworldly. Who am I to judge?</p>

<p>Rounding out the Cabin Porn trifecta we have an <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/69092889921/abandoned-shed-in-lake-paroho-south-korea">abandoned shed in South Korea</a> of all places. If I had to guess its location, I would have said West Virginia: I have seen a spot very much like this alongside a river many times when visiting friends there last summer. Who would have guessed that such a nondescript cabin as this one, one that could have just as easily come from the heart of America, would call South Korea home? Not me, for sure.</p>

<p>I could have sworn I collected links from <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog">Huckberry</a> for <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-1113.html">last month&#8217;s roundup</a>, but it appears I only did so for other topics. Linking to <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/shelter-treehouse-x-three">this tree house</a>, then, marks the first time another site has appeared in the now-three-month-old Cabin Porn Roundups. Talk about a milestone. Seriously though, Peter Bahouth&#8217;s three tree houses outside Atlanta, Georgia, are extraordinary. When most think of a tree house, they reminisce on their childhood summers either spent in or yearning for one; Peter made that dream a reality. Good for him.</p>

<p>The final link I have also came from Huckberry by way of Twitter: a picture of <a href="https://twitter.com/kaz/status/406515062392643584">the border between Norway and Sweden</a>. Absolutely beautiful; nothing else I can say will do this scene justice save urging you to check it out. What a fantastic picture.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s all I have for this month. In December I expanded the list of sites I cull pictures and articles from to two; hopefully in January I will continue this trend. Now that I have the whole posting on schedule thing down, after all, I need some goal to keep me going.</p>

<p>The only thing I love more than listening to podcasts is writing about them. During <a href="http://curiousrat.com/the-state-of-podcasting-2013">the last curfuffle</a> I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html"><em>Podcasting State of the Union</em></a> where I did my best to provide counterpoints for the flaws Harry Marks pointed out in the podcasting industry. To my delight, <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke/status/387840995465105408">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/387879318774620160">agreed</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattalexand/status/387917466325622784">with</a> me. After a few days the heat died down though, and I did not expect to have another opportunity to discuss this topic for a while. Then Ben Brooks decided to stir the pot once more with <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/podcasts-worries/"><em>Why Tech Podcasts Bother Me</em></a>, and <a href="http://buildingtwenty.net/posts/podcasts">many</a> <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/2013-12-that-podcast-bombshell">responded</a> with wildly different opinions. Perhaps most notably, Andrew Clark and Zac Cichy of <a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a> surprised me in <a href="http://themenubar.net/podcastfeed/tmb-ep034">episode thirty-four</a> by agreeing with the majority of Ben&#8217;s points.</p>

<p>Like his predecessor Harry Marks, Ben&#8217;s critiques focused on many of the same aspects: a lack of preparation beforehand and focus throughout leading to a rambling program, the pervasive &#8220;good ol&#8216; boy&#8221; mentality driving shows less about specific topics and more about the hosts themselves, and little to no polish. In fact, during the first eleven minutes of the The Menu Bar&#8217;s thirty-fifth episode Harry Marks, in reference to Ben&#8217;s piece, said that both articles &#8220;hit many of the same points, except his was a lot more colorful&#8221;, which I found amusing. <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/podcasts-worries/#identifier_4_15683">To not waste your time</a> by reiterating my refutations of those points once again, let me translate: Ben&#8217;s complaints equate to Harry&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes or Less&#8221;, &#8220;Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little&#8221;, &#8220;&#8217;Tis the Season&#8221;, and &#8220;Edit, Edit, Edit&#8221;, respectively, which I tackle <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#60MinutesorLess">here</a>, <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#PickaLittleTalkaLittle">here</a>, <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#TistheSeason">here</a>, and <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#EditEditEdit">here</a>. Since I have already discussed these topics at length, I will not do so again here as I feel my opinions still stand. I will, however, focus on another subject Andrew and Zac brought up on <em>How the Andrew Stole Christmas</em>: podcast playback speeds.</p>

<p>Back in October Marco posted an article titled <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/18/podcast-app-playback-speeds"><em>Podcast App Playback Speed</em></a> where he explained that when most podcast apps advertise playback speeds other than 1x, they actual play audio at another. From his article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In the early days of iOS podcast playback, when Apple first implemented multiple speed settings, they used inaccurate labels. Apple&#8217;s &#8216;2x&#8217; setting, for instance, was really 1.5x. Their &#8216;1.5x&#8217; setting was really 1.25x. And their &#8216;1/2x&#8217; setting was really 0.8x.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will note that under this system playback tops out at 1.5x, labeled at 2x, yet apps like Instacast still sport a &#8220;3x&#8221; mode. Unlike Pocket Casts, which plays audio back at <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/18/podcast-app-playback-speeds#fn:pIAXwbhkM2">three times the default rate</a>, Instacast uses a &#8220;3x&#8221; moniker to play episodes back at double speed. This is all important to keep in mind when I finally drop the bombshell that I often listen to my favorite podcasts at up to &#8220;3x&#8221; speed, i.e. twice as fast as the producers intended. For those of you incapable of doing math, that means it can take me thirty minutes to get through an hour-long show. Even more so than a daily hour-long commute and a job that often allows me to plug a pair of headphones in for a couple hours each day, this habit enables me to continue expanding my podcast queue.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Apparently in the world of podcast producers, everyone hates this practice: both Andrew and Zac came down hard on it, and Marco would rather &#8220;unsubscribe to a third of my shows or skip a third of the episodes&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the thing&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>here&#8217;s the thing, Dan: you can&#8217;t replace a gorilla with a watermelon.</em></p>

<p>No, on a more serious note: I cannot listen to podcasts at 1x: it makes me want to tear my headphones out and disavow podcasts altogether; it feels as if the hosts speak maddeningly slow just to infuriate me as I sit there waiting what feels like an eternity just for him to finish a single thought. If I could not increase my playback speed, I would seriously have to consider the number of podcasts I subscribe to not necessarily because I could no longer cut down on the time required to finish any given episode, but simply because I could not bear sitting through anywhere near as many shows only to fidget irritatedly as the hosts plod along in their speech. But I can toggle that speed, which both enables and allows me to follow so many more great shows than I would otherwise.</p>

<p>To me, vilifying this feature makes as little sense as prosecuting Instapaper would: I save every article I come across to Instapaper so that I can easily find it later, yes, but mostly because I hate the vast majority of mobile websites. I still want to read and have a great deal of respect for the words within those pages though, so I use this service to remove the one barrier to a pleasurable ordeal reading another&#8217;s prose. In more abstract terms, I find valuable ideas and change the way in which they get presented to me pursuant of a superior experience. Similarly with podcasts, I realize the difficulty of speaking. Furthermore, doing it well proves even more challenging&#160;&#8212;&#160;I know because a few weeks ago I tried recording my voice for an audition to Brett Terpstra&#8217;s Systematic, and it sounded terrible. Just because someone makes a podcast does not mean they have the voice, vocabulary, or diction to do so well, yet many&#160;&#8212;&#160;thankfully&#160;&#8212;&#160;overcome those inhibitions and hit the record button anyway. While few possess all three imperfections, many have one, and bumping my playback speed up to 1.5x&#160;&#8212;&#160;true 1.25x, the lowest I can listen to any podcast these days&#160;&#8212;&#160;helps smooth over the verbal flaws that otherwise lend themselves to an overall less pleasurable encounter. Just as my decision to take nearly every author&#8217;s content out of its intended setting does not reflect a lack of regard for their work, neither does this choice. In fact, it is out of respect that I do it in the first place: I hold these people and their ideas in such high regard that I just <em>have</em> to listen to their shows, objections be damned. Very few podcast hosts claim to be great at what they do, and by slightly increasing my playback speed I can get through their vocal quirks much more easily. What&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>

<p>Playback speeds are not evil incarnate; it&#8217;s about time we stopped pretending they were.</p>

<p>Obviously, by my own words at this point I have only justified playback up to 1.25x. However, once you let go of the ridiculous notion that playing another&#8217;s voice back at integer-greater-than-one-x equates to a lack of respect for their work, anything greater than 1x becomes merely a matter of preference. Do you enjoy fast talkers? Go ahead and bump that up to 2x. Do you enjoy larger fonts? Go ahead and resize Instapaper&#8217;s font.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Since October when I posted <em>Podcasting State of the Union</em>, I have subscribed to nine more podcasts: <a href="http://justthetip.fm">Just the Tip</a>, <a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us">Technical Difficulties US</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/bestof">The Best of 5by5</a>, <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug">Debug</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power Users</a>, <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/">Unprofessional</a>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/video/the-vergecast">The Vergecast</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic">Systematic</a>, and <a href="http://5by5.tv/homework">Homework</a>. Of those nine I have listened to the entirety of The Best of 5by5, Systematic, and Homework, and have already started on Just the Tip and Debug. Until I finish those two, the others are much more hit and miss: unless an episode features someone I know and like a great deal, they will have to wait their turn.</p>

<p>Back in April <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/email-list-and-rss.html">I linked to</a> Rich Stevens&#8217; <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=928">announcement</a> of a new newsletter he planned to begin publishing once or twice a week focusing on &#8220;A little business, a little gadgetry, a little art and writing, and a few dick jokes.&#8221; Since then I have enjoyed his seventeen posts immensely, and the latest was no exception: in <em>Nerd, Decentralize Thyself</em><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Rich Stevens spoke to the recent trend towards relying on platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter, and how despite liking both he would never forfeit ownership of his website. He went on to call for more people devoted to pointing out great work in order to solve the discoverability problem those aforementioned services aim to obviate as a way of decreasing our reliance on third parties to do great work and, hopefully, make building a website back into something cool again. If you find this description at all interesting, subscribe to the newsletter; you will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>Personally, I could not agree more: I love Squarespace and Tumblr has a great thing going for it, but I want to be the one responsible for my Markdown parser failing to recognizing a link. I like downloading my web.config file so that I can mess it up for half an hour. If I feel like changing how readers view footnotes, then by God <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">I will</a>. Running this sort of website has a much higher barrier to entry, but it also brings with it a much greater reward. Just as not everyone can handle working from home, I cannot in good conscience say that everyone should go write their own CMS; however, once you experience the benefits of doing so, you will never want to go back.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;I would love to provide a link, but given that the newsletter does not exist on any known website or publicly available page I can only point you to <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/edgecase.xml">the RSS feed</a> with the hope that you either have an RSS reader on your computer or run a browser capable of opening the feed, i.e. not Safari.</p>

<p>Prompted by an article Zach Epstein posted to BGR last Thursday titled <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/12/26/mac-pro-windows-diy-cost/"><em>Testing the &#8216;Apple tax&#8217;: What would it cost to build a Windows version of the new Mac Pro?</em></a> I planned to link his piece as a smug counterpoint to all the people I know who like saying that they can build a more powerful machine for &#8220;1/3 the cost&#8221;<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of my overpriced Apple computer. As I thought more about the notion of an Apple tax though, I realized I had more to say on this topic than a juvenile &#8220;ha ha&#8221;.</p>

<p>Last week I visited a long-time friend of mine while on Christmas vacation. Before I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html">bought a new Retina MacBook Pro</a>, he and I had counted ourselves amongst the strongest of PC fanatics: throughout the entirety of our short lives on this earth we had both never owned a machine without the DELL logo emblazoned upon the lid, and would not even consider owning something so ridiculous as a Mac. We wanted to do real work, after all, and as well all know work does not get done on anything sporting a bitten apple. Ready for a new computer before college though, hesitant to adopt Windows 8&#8217;s problematic paradigms, and curious as to how the other half lived, I changed my mind, took a leap of faith, and bought a Mac. Sitting in my friend&#8217;s room last week having neglected to share this now month-old news with him, I searched for words to justify my change of heart. To my surprise, I found them in the very reasons we loved to hate Apple&#8217;s products.</p>

<p>We got on to the topic of computers, as we invariably do, while waiting for his laptop to open the CADD program Inventor. Since last I saw him he and another friend had built a 3D printer, so given his ability create a functioning digital model of nearly any conceivable object we set out to create a Lego part yearned for in our years as FIRST Lego League participants: a peg bushing. Those familiar with the world of Lego robotics will immediately grasp the rationale of such a piece, just like a quarter bushing; others will stop reading here. As we waited for Inventor to start, his system slowed to a crawl: even opening a sticky note took significantly longer than it should have on a machine built in 2012 and equipped with an i7 chipset; after a minute or so, his fans kicked in adding a subtle whine to the din of our parents&#8217; voices downstairs. He dismissed the noise: &#8220;They turn on with the computer.&#8221; A better opportunity could not have presented itself on a silver platter as I explained that it took HandBrake encoding a 1080p video alongside Transmission saturating my internet connection to establish that my new Retina MacBook Pro did indeed possess fans; up until that point I had assumed it did, but as the weeks wore on without the slightest whir I had began to believe otherwise, that Apple had somehow managed to obviate the need for a cooling system within this tight aluminum clamshell. And then came the kicker: even under such an extreme load<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> my Mac has yet to experience a demonstrable decrease in performance.</p>

<p>Using these qualities, made all the more attractive by the veritable wind tunnel his inch-and-a-half fan had created, as a jumping-off point, I continued expounding upon the virtues of this new machine: in addition to unfettered power and for all intents and purposes nonexistent fans, I still manage to get somewhere in the range of six to twelve hours of battery life depending on my use case in a laptop only slightly larger than his screen. I will not buy another Mac next time I need a new computer for love of the operating system, I explained, although OS X continues to grow on me the more I use it, but instead for the fantastic hardware that I cannot get anywhere else: while I may find a computer with similar technical specifications and maybe even at identical price points, I will never track down one also capable of running eight hours without charging or fitting inside a folder alongside my notebook paper. Zach&#8217;s article retroactively corroborated this statement: finding similar PC hardware proved just as impossible for Apple&#8217;s ten inch monster the Mac Pro as it would have for the MacBook Pro&#8217;s form factor, which is to say nothing for the price such typically commands in both machines. As Zach&#8217;s piece illustrated, in reality a comparable&#160;&#8212;&#160;based solely on performance&#160;&#8212;&#160;PC would cost significantly more than an offering from Apple.</p>

<p>When building a PC, one must choose one or the other, power or form factor; when choosing an Apple product, one never need make such a demoralizing decision.

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-29 15:06:02-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/29 15:06:02 EST</time>
<p>From almost a week ago, midway through my Christmas vacation, Betaworks announced the latest in a slew of great improvements to the Instapaper platform: Instapaper Daily. Although I cannot say it will replace Tweetbot or Reeder as one of my primary sources for news and articles to read, I really like this as a service and as an indicator of the direction Betaworks plans on taking Instapaper.</p>

<p>In the past I have criticized Betaworks for both <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/instapaper-5.html">insufficient design sense</a> in their web ventures and a lack of direction driving their product decisions. With the release of Instapaper Daily they have assuaged these misgivings, at least a little, by continuing to improve upon Instapaper&#8217;s core value proposition&#160;&#8212;&#160;improving one&#8217;s reading experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;and doing so beautifully: whereas Instapaper&#8217;s website remains an eyesore at best, Instapaper Daily presents its information in a clear, concise, and visually attractive manner.</p>

<p>Good for them.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-29 14:30:27-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/29 14:30:27 EST</time>
<p>As soon as Information Architects released Writer Pro shortly before Christmas, I began collecting &#8220;<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/12/first-thoughts-writer-pro-ios/">first look</a>&#8221; pieces after <a href="http://writer.pro">their phenomenal introductory video</a> nearly caused me to shell out a hefty $40 to have the app on both my Mac and iOS devices sight on seen. Much more cautions after my <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html">poor</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-coin.html">experience</a> with Coin though, I exercised a bit of restraint in choosing to wait until after Christmas to make my final decision. Nine days and one debacle later, I am very thankful I did.</p>

<p>If I had to pick one aspect to critique out of all the talk surrounding Writer Pro since its debut, I would pick an apparent genesis of extreme entitlement: regarding price, $40 for an impressive, cross-platform writing app does not signal extortion, but rather a sustainable business model and a group of developers who value the fruit of their labors enough to spurn the disappointing race to the bottom we have seen on the App Store in recent months. iA ought not have been criticized for pricing Writer Pro in such a way, no matter how few did this, but instead should receive praise for doing so. How incredibly entitled must one be in order to sit on a couch and proclaim years&#8217; of work not worth a paltry $40? There is a larger point to be made here about App Store pricing in general, but for now I will let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

<p>Even more overblown than the price though is Writer Pro&#8217;s syntax highlighting and the patent brouhaha, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/26/patent-before-christmas">as John Gruber put it</a>, that came as a result of iA trying to attack other developers using it. While we must give them credit for attempting to obviate a skill all accomplished writers should possess, as Brett Terpstra explained in his <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/12/28/web-excursions-for-december-28-2013/"><em>Web Excursions for December 28, 2013</em></a> post this is nothing more than a polished implementation of the built-in function NSLinguisticTagger; iA did not reinvent the wheel here. When they filed for and then planning on attacking small, independent developers with a patent on such an &#8220;innovation&#8221;, then, it is no wonder nearly <a href="http://prolost.com/twas">everyone</a> went after Information Architects for this sleazy practice. How disgustingly entitled must you be to engender the audacity necessary to justify repackaging a built-in system function, billing it as an incredible, mind-blowing innovation, and then threatening one-man shops for their use of this feature long before their own?</p>

<p>I really wanted to buy Writer Pro when it came out, and I still do&#160;&#8212;&#160;perhaps now more than ever. But at the same time I know that if I were to spend $40 on what is almost undoubtedly an excellent writing experience, I would do so in support of these deplorable practices, and that is something I just cannot stomach. So I went out and bought Brett Terpstra&#8217;s Marked 2, and I suggest you go do the same. I may never use Marked 2, or I might end up using it every day; either way, I will at least rest secure in the knowledge that I have contributed to the livelihood of a developer I hold in high esteem.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-22 10:04:59-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/22 10:04:59 EST</time>
<p>Recently, Phil Robertson of the sensational cable TV program Duck Dynasty has drawn quite a bit of <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/12/19/255430555/duck-and-cover-what-exactly-is-the-point">flack</a> for his very Christian views kept largely hidden until now through A&E&#8217;s refusal to air his more candid statements. Setting personal opinions aside though and totally disregard the absurdity of crucifying Phil for his beliefs because today&#8217;s hyper-sensitive, disgustingly entitled society seeks to vilify everyone who challenges their nuanced values, and looking at this from an unbiased standpoint, a very interesting lifestyle emerges in <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson">Drew Magary&#8217;s article for GQ</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;incidentally, the article that started this whole debacle. The entire piece is excellent, but if I had to pick my favorite line it came down to Drew&#8217;s revelatory experience toward the end, for I can relate to that very feeling myself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you think of Phil&#8217;s beliefs, it&#8217;s hard not to gaze upon his cultivations and wonder if you&#8217;ve gotten life all wrong. This is life as summer camp. It&#8217;s gorgeous, in a way that alters you on an elemental level. I feel it when I breathe the air. I feel it when I survey the enormity of the space around me. I shouldn&#8217;t be sitting around the house and bitching because the new iOS 7 touchscreen icons don&#8217;t have any fucking drop shadow. I should be out here, dammit! Killing things and growing things and bringing dead things home to cook! There is a life out in this wilderness that I am too chickenshit to lead.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spectacular. The most impactful line, however, came just a few paragraphs later at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the direction he would like to point everyone: back to the woods. Back to the pioneer spirit. Back to God. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we go back to the old days?&#8217; he asked me at one point. But now, I&#8217;m afraid, I must get out of the ATV and go back to where I belong, back to the godless part of America that Phil is determined to save.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drew took a very measured approach to the article despite failing to see eye to eye with Phil on quite a few things, and I laud him for that and for his impressive writing ability. Very well done, and worth the read many times over.</p>

<p>Great news. Now, the only reason I have left to keep Apple&#8217;s Mail app around is for the occasional spam message, which Mailbox curiously does not have any way of handling. Once Mailbox builds that functionality in, I can happily say goodbye to Mail.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/not-soon-enough/">Ben Brooks</a>, Chrys Bader takes a very interesting look at where Facebook came from, its current state, and the platform&#8217;s bleak future. With the exception of Twitter I have all but abandoned social networks, including the venerable elder statesman Facebook, so I rarely take any interest in articles examining them. I followed Ben&#8217;s link on a whim though, and I&#8217;m very glad I did.</p>

<p>Especially damning, I thought, was his comparison of Facebook to LinkedIn: &#8220;Teens likely see Facebook the same way the Facebook generation sees LinkedIn&#160;&#8212;&#160;like a utilitarian place to manage connections.&#8221; Facebook has crossed the Rubicon, so to speak; from here no amount of money will ever bring it back.</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/ben-thompson-on-misunderstood.html">Ben Thompson on Apple's New *Misunderstood* Commercial</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-17 14:32:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/17 14:32:31 EST</time>
<p>Having updated <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/misunderstood/">his article on Apple&#8217;s latest ad</a>, Ben Thompson finally delved in to the reason so many fell in love with this commercial in the first place, and <a href="https://twitter.com/drewcosten/status/412928515395158017">the reason</a> so many have talked about it. As I said <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/misunderstood.html">earlier</a> this video hits so close to home because it does not focus on feature comparisons or implausible situations necessitating eighteen processors, but instead on the experiences Apple&#8217;s devices enable:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;By letting go of tangible product features&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, by exploiting a brand promise developed over the last decade&#160;&#8212;&#160;Apple is associating its flagship product with the happy resolution of that deep-seated longing on both sides, resulting in an emotion far more real than any possible articulation of a feature or spec.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben took this notion a step further by clearly defining the gap Apple&#8217;s iPhone bridged in this commercial, and I could not agree more with both that point and his final one that this&#160;&#8212;&#160;Apple&#8217;s ads and this one in particular&#160;&#8212;&#160;is advertising at its finest. After reading his article though, I have a few tangential thoughts to share:</p>

<p>Like Ben I also saw a number of people snarkily commenting on this video, mostly on Twitter, searching for any reason&#160;&#8212;&#160;no matter how far-fetched&#160;&#8212;&#160;to discredit Apple&#8217;s impressive work here. For example, perhaps the most frequent criticism cites the implausibility of one&#8217;s grandparents owning an Apple TV as if doing so in some way takes away from the video&#8217;s significance. I can hardly justify dignifying such an insignificant point with any response other than pure derision. As I know I have said before, if that is the only disparagement you can come up with perhaps you ought to do something more productive and waste less of my time: although Apple TVs remain a &#8220;hobby&#8221; at Apple, the product has been around for nearly seven years already over which it has become an increasingly less marginalized product adopted by a growing number of consumers each year. Perhaps <em>your</em> grandparents still have one of those TVs controlled with a rotating dial, but mine do not; basing your entire argument on such a flimsy base of evidence, then, is nothing short of asinine.</p>

<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more.</p>

<p>Ben also pointed out that many naysayers have had so little footing from which to complain that they also criticized Apple&#8217;s commercial for promoting &#8220;recording your family over actually spending time with your family&#8221;. In my opinion, Ben&#8217;s response<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> was far too harsh: as an intelligent, technologically-minded community we know how significant an impact commercials like these have on today&#8217;s teenagers. Have we learned nothing from Samsung&#8217;s <a href="http://vator.tv/news/2013-03-15-samsung-reveals-gs4-with-obnoxiously-sexist-skit">outrageous GS4 presentation?</a> Blame for the misogynistic tendencies all too prevalent in today&#8217;s youth clearly belongs to the world&#8217;s premiere tech companies. And then, as if one company ruining the world&#8217;s youth was not enough, Apple comes along with this &#8220;Christmas&#8221; commercial telling kids to spend less time with their families. Smh. After all, it&#8217;s not as if anything else would prompt today&#8217;s teens to spend a disproportionate amount of time on their phones: the App Store only has a paltry million apps, social networks only come and go every few months, and Instagram&#160;&#8212;&#160;seriously? That&#8217;s so last week&#160;&#8212;&#160;no one I know spends any times taking pictures and interacting with their friends on there anymore. And that&#8217;s to say nothing of texting or phone calls which, again, no one I know does anymore. Clearly, given the lack of any other incentive kids have for spending time on their phones, the blame must fall to Apple, and saying anything else would be to devolve into one of those Apple fanbois.</p>

<p>Yes, with an &#8220;i&#8221;. Because that makes sense.</p>


<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;&#8220;But I think that&#8217;s a touch too cynical, and misses the impact of this ad.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The iPhone shown in the first half of the commercial wasn&#8217;t being used as an escape device to kill boredom&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s advertised as a creation device used to create memories, edit videos, and share a touching moment with family members that you don&#8217;t see much often anymore. From the iPhone&#8217;s camera point of view, now mirrored via AirPlay onto the big screen for others to see, everything makes more sense: seeing relatives and watching them talk, play, and share personal moments. The iPhone was used to record life rather than escape from it. The home video ends, notably, with a selfie; people are happy, the kid is happy. Cut to family house seen from outside. Happy holidays from Apple.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then at the end of his article, Federico writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As Christmas approaches, Apple is once again advertising the iPhone as an experience more than a gadget. It&#8217;s not about the camera sensor, the faster processor, the apps, or wireless streaming taken individually&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s about how all these elements, together, make technology (in this case, Apple&#8217;s technology) fit into our lives, empowering us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I saw more and more articles and tweets talking about Apple&#8217;s latest ad <a href="http://youtu.be/ImlmVqH_5HM">Misunderstood</a> while scrolling through my Twitter timeline a few hours ago, I did not even plan to watch it. It was just another ad, after all, and certainly not something special. Having come to the end of my RSS feeds and with nothing to show for my efforts though, I opened Federico Viticci&#8217;s article from which the two quotes above came from.</p>

<p>His first paragraph, I felt, described every important detail that made this commercial great: a distant and preoccupied teen that we could all get behind and collectively boo turns into the tale&#8217;s hero by its end, leaving us with a warm and fuzzy feeling as we watched the fruits of his labors in <a href="http://youtu.be/JEGLhdaFBSE">a cute family Christmas video</a>. Aww. It was the second of the two, however, that interested me the most as I finished Federico&#8217;s article wishing he had expounded upon that final point.</p>

<p>In his penultimate paragraph Federico succinctly distilled the message Apple both now and has always wished to impart upon consumers: that its products do not come down to a feature checklist, but something much less tangible and infinitely more valuable. Pursuant of this goal Apple&#8217;s ads, if they even deserve such a loaded, stigmatized designation, have become famous for highlighting real life interactions and special moments made possible thanks to their fantastical devices. Take the <a href="http://youtu.be/B8Le9wvoY00">Life on iPad</a> video from October, for instance, which starts with two engineers atop a wind turbine and ends by showing a climber resting hundreds of feet above the ground hanging from a cliff face. Apple refuses to beat anyone over the head with specs, fantasized use cases, or subtly sexual advertising; their ads are classy in the truest sense of the word, like the secret Santa who despite his best efforts gets found out only to modestly accept the heartfelt gratitude of his friends. Like the bystander who might mistake this aversion to praise for aloofness, perhaps this refinement is the reason so many misunderstand Apple.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-16 21:11:02-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/16 21:11:02 EST</time>
<p>In <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/disavow-gaming.html"><em>The One Where I Disavow Gaming</em></a> I outlined two goals I wished to work towards using this newfound time of mine previously wasted &#8220;mindlessly tapping the W, A, S, and D keys for hours on end&#8221;: to write more regularly and code more frequently. A week later the former remains a work in progress, while I can happily report that the latter has gone so well I not only successfully fixed a number of outstanding bugs and implemented quite a few new features in the process, but went on to add some impressive functionality I hadn&#8217;t even considered before then as well. Although this focus only allowed for a single post most days last week, I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the results.</p>

<p>First and most obviously, any page that lists article previews now does so without a &#8220;save to Instapaper&#8221; link. Previously, I tacked on an &#8220;Open the full article or save to Instapaper&#8221; line to every post. Now that line merely reads &#8220;Open the full article&#8221;. Initially I chose to include this link with every single post as a way of implicitly endorsing Instapaper with each article I published. However, a year later adding content in this manner remains janky at best: given that I did not possess anyone&#8217;s Instapaper credentials save my own, and that I refused to use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/publishers">a pre-styled button</a>, clicking my &#8220;save to Instapaper&#8221; link brought users to a page asking for confirmation before adding the article to their reading queue, at which point the site would redirect them back to the original article&#8217;s page on my website. While this process did manage to get the job done, it never did so very well, and so I removed the feature entirely. Now, Instapaper users can either use the official Chrome or Safari browser extension, a bookmarklet, or the brainchild of a third-party developer like Brett Terpstra&#8217;s <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/instapaperbeyond/">Instapaper Beyond</a>. Each and every one of these ways works much better than a series of redirects, so I have completely stopped advocating that route.</p>

<p>Out of all these improvements I devoted most of my time to a change very few users will ever see. Up until last week, clicking &#8220;Post Archives&#8221; opened a single page listing all but the latest twenty articles, which reside on the home page. As of today that would have meant more than 400 entries, and a nightmare for anyone needing a specific article. Compounding the problem for those seeking an article within a certain time period, nothing separated those entries by date: I did not display any sort of publication time stamp, posts from December abutted those from January, and nothing delineated articles published in 2012 from those published in 2013. This approach did, however, have one upside: using a browser&#8217;s local search on this page would match an article regardless of whether or not I published it this week, month, or year. With this single advantage in mind, I set out to bring much-needed improvement to this neglected portion of my website.</p>

<p>At first I intended to replicate OS X&#8217;s Finder by creating tables for each year and month I had made a post, associating those collections with classes and IDs, and using jQuery to tie everything together into one fluid portal. Conceptually, this interface would have allowed me to explore my archives just as one would a file hierarchy. With such complexity and so many moving parts though, I decided on a different route before this idea made it past the first round of testing. Instead, I opted for a system of static pages that would allow me to retain the one benefit of my previous approach while simultaneously improving the granularity at which users could search for articles using their browser&#8217;s in-page search feature.</p>

<p>Keeping the original &#8220;Post Archives&#8221; page intact, I added links to two more pages in its navigation bar: &#8220;2012 Archives&#8221; and &#8220;2013 Archives&#8221;. As I continue posting here that list will also grow. Whereas this page contains every post I have ever made save those on the home page, clicking either of these two links will open a page comprised of only articles published within that year. At the bottom of each page I also included a list of links for each month I had posted an article. Unsurprisingly, within these pages reside all the articles from their respective months. Under this new system if a user has a general idea as to when I released a particular article, he or she can drill down in specificity all the way to a particular month. If, on the other hand, someone just wants to find the last time I talked about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-coin.html">Coin</a>, a simple CMD+ or CTRL+F on the Post Archives page will suffice.</p>

<p>Last but by no means least in this list of major changes First Crack underwent since last week&#8217;s disavowal, I finally broke down and gave up on my aversion to using Javascript. In the past when faced with a challenge I could have solved with the popular scripting language I either found a way to accomplish a similar goal using only CSS or discarded the project entirely. Not because I dislike the language or don&#8217;t understand it, but rather out of a desire to adhere to a minimalist site design in every sense of the word, from back-end tasks to front-end aesthetics. Yesterday, though, Marco posted <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/15/bigfoot">a short article</a> talking about a jQuery plugin called <a href="http://cmsauve.com/labs/bigfoot/">Bigfoot</a> created to provide Instapaper-like popovers for footnotes on the web. Although it took some getting used to, I eventually came around and spent this morning putting it into place. After a few tweaks, I shipped this update like I had all others&#160;&#8212;&#160;silently and without fanfare&#160;&#8212;&#160;earlier this afternoon, and then I sat down to write this post.</p>

<p>In addition to these improvements I also made a number of other more minor changes to both First Crack and this site. &#8220;Server-side&#8221;, so to speak, for in reality although First Crack could operate solely on a server I choose to run it on my home computer and use FTP to update my site, I added three new abilities to First Crack&#8217;s &#8220;Authoring&#8221; mode. Entered with the &#8220;-a&#8221; command line parameter, First Crack now supports the following commands:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;-t&#8221; for manually modifying a post&#8217;s update time.</p>
<p>&#8220;-T&#8221; for setting a post&#8217;s update time to that of its backup in a separate folder, new in this version.</p>
<p>&#8220;-r&#8221; for forcing First Crack to rebuild a single article, the home page, and the RSS feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;-R&#8221; for forcing First Crack to rebuild every site resource.</p>
<p>&#8220;-u&#8221; for uploading a specific article to the server, along with the updated home page, archive pages, and RSS feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;-U&#8221; for uploading the five most recent articles and the update home page, archive pages, and RSS feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;-V&#8221; for re-uploading the entire website from the local copy, new with this version.</p>
<p>&#8220;-B&#8221; for uploading all back-end files such as style sheets and Javascript documents, also new with this version.</p>
<p>&#8220;-h&#8221; to display the menu listing all accepted commands.</p>
<p>&#8220;exit&#8221; to quit First Crack&#8217;s prompt and check for new content files.</p>
<p>&#8220;!exit&#8221; to quit First Crack&#8217;s prompt and exit the program without taking any further action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Client-side&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, aspects of my website users will come into contact with&#160;&#8212;&#160;I made a few small tweaks to the design and implemented <a href="http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/pointer-events-60fps">a neat trick</a> to boost performance when scrolling using the &#8220;pointer-events: none;&#8221; css property. With most of the major features taken care of now, First Crack has taken one more giant step towards becoming feature complete. As I promised more than a year ago at this site&#8217;s debut, I plan to release First Crack as an open source project on GitHub in the very near future in the hopes that the indie software community will make First Crack even better than it already is.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-13 07:04:41-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/13 07:04:41 EST</time>
<p>Last night I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/more-coin.html">took Coin to task</a> for extending their pre-order sale, again, in to the new year rather than allowing it to expire as should have happened sometime today. I briefly explained how this move has further devalued their product by virtually solidifying it at the $50 price point, and then talked about how Coin&#8217;s latest escapade showed a startling lack of respect for the individuals who put their hard-earned cash on the line so that this company could fulfill its one job in life by making a great device. Unlike the causes behind the former though, which I could explain with relatively simple examples, the latter&#160;&#8212;&#160;distilling the relationship between maker and consumer&#160;&#8212;&#160;proved much more difficult. I touched on this topic in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html">my past</a> articles <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html">on Coin</a>, but have not actively sought to fully flesh out my thoughts on this topic until now.</p>

<p>I feel the best explanation of this relationship between maker and consumer<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, comes from looking to the social phenomenon that is Kickstarter. Every time an individual deigns to back a project, that decision gets made secure in a number of expectations. First, that in exchange for a set amount of money a product will come into existence. This is the most basic principle of Kickstarter: until funded&#160;&#8212;&#160;until a given project garners enough money to actually deliver on its promised products or service&#160;&#8212;&#160;no money changes hands. After that set and clearly defined point, however, backers can rest assured in the knowledge that for a generally nominal fee their chosen project will indeed come to fruition.</p>

<p>Second, and arguably just as important, is the social contract the backer and project manager enter in to once money changes hands. With my money in your bank account I now hold you responsible for the success or failure of this project. In addition to an expectation of communication throughout the process, born of my position as shareholder wondering as to my investment&#8217;s success, this process also lends itself to a strong sense of standing: I, as the one providing funding, understand that my place is not to dictate how the project attains success. The makers, on the other hand, as the ones building the product, understand that the onus is on them to build their promised device with the money I gave them because I gave it to them. They may well be the commander of this project, but I as the backer&#160;&#8212;&#160;the source of funding&#160;&#8212;&#160;am the master, the ultimate authority determining whether or not the commander may proceed past the idea stage.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is all a roundabout way to say that in each Kickstarter project there is some base level of trust between backer and project manager: trust that my funds will go towards ultimately making a theoretical device or service, and that one day I will receive a return on my investment; and trust that throughout the process I will receive occasional reports detailing progress, failure, or anything really. Coin eschewed every single one of those expectations and qualities. Their decision to operate outside of Kickstarter&#8217;s boundaries should have served as warning enough, but shoddy marketing tactics blindsided me&#160;&#8212;&#160;and many others, it would seem&#160;&#8212;&#160;to the implications of this decision and before I knew it my bank account had gone down $50. Currently I have no guarantee that I will ever see a return on that investment: if the pre-sale keeps extending, what about that vague ship date of summer 2014?</p>

<p>Whereas in a Kickstarter project backers benefit from so many niceties lending themselves to such a superb experience many come back to fund increasingly more projects after their first, Coin embodies every flipside Kickstarter was created to prevent.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;As a brief aside, I really dislike this word because especially next to &#8220;maker&#8221;, it seems particularly superficial and decidedly meaningless.</p>

<p>I feel a bit like a broken record at this point, what with having already talked about Coin <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html">twice</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html">before</a>, but the company&#8217;s latest stunt bears once again picking up my banner and going back off to war: earlier this evening, via their Twitter account, Coin posted a &#8220;BREAKING NEWS!&#8221; announcement that&#160;&#8212;&#160;you guessed it&#160;&#8212;&#160;extended the $50 off early adopter deal into the new year. Surprised? You should&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>Last week I spoke to the possibility of this happening in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bad-coin.html"><em>Bad Coin</em></a>. Given that I suspected Coin would pull a stunt like this back then, it really shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that they did, in fact, devalue their product once again while with the other hand slap all those who had shelled out a hard-earned $50 to get their product off the ground in the face. Because ultimately, that is exactly what they did: continuing to sell Coin at half it&#8217;s alleged price&#160;&#8212;&#160;but really, who actually believes it costs anywhere near $100 for each of these little devices anymore?&#160;&#8212;&#160;has cemented it&#8217;s value at $50. Coin is doing the freelancing equivalent of entering the market at a heavily discounted price in order to get customers in the door without actually telling those customers that they have received a sizable discount, and then continuing to charge that unsustainably low wage for the first dozen projects. Just as that hypothetical freelancer will have a very difficult time raising those prices to the industry standard after so many jobs at such a low wage, so too do I foresee Coin having a similarly hard time convincing anyone their product is worth anything more than $50 if this sale ever actually ends.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is the question of whether a Coin is actually worth $100, or if that too was a marketing gimmick designed to trick backers into pouring money into this project. At this point I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Coin&#8217;s price <em>lowered</em> after this imaginary pre-sale ended, citing some made up excuse for charging early adopters a premium. This goes back to the striking lack of even the most base respect Coin apparently has for the people who took a leap of faith to climb on board the Coin bandwagon and pledge their support for this neat little device. Coin shat all over that relationship by pantomiming urgency in its release and then reneging on that promise later; unsurprisingly, they have done it once again here. In a word, disappointing. Incredibly disappointing.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-12-11 19:30:21-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-12.html">12</a>/11 19:30:21 EST</time>
<p>After all the talk of <a href="http://castro.fm">Castro</a> in the last twenty-four hours since its release, and as an <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html">avid podcast listener myself</a>, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel obligated to weigh in. With articles from <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/12/castro/">John Moltz</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/castro-a-new-podcast-player-for-ios-does-two-things-well/">Cody Fink</a>, and <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/whats-new-noteworthy-world-apps-week/">Shawn Blanc</a> waiting unread in my Instapaper queue, I downloaded Castro earlier this evening expecting to burn the midnight oil to get this article out. It came as a great surprise, then, when I tried every one of Castro&#8217;s features and saw every screen within about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Obviously designed with iOS 7 in mind, Castro came to market without any carryovers from past versions unlike the industry&#8217;s current darlings Instacast and Pocketcasts, and it shows in an aesthetically pleasing user interface. In addition to an attractive departure from the norm with respect to its design though, Castro&#8217;s youth also appears to have manifested itself in the app&#8217;s unfortunately small feature set. However, whether this limited functionality came as a result of time constraints or an overbearing philosophy dictating extreme simplicity, I cannot say for sure. Outside the <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/12/castro/">apparently remarkable ability to download episodes in the background</a>, the much more venerable ability to <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/castro-a-new-podcast-player-for-ios-does-two-things-well/">quickly search for and find podcasts</a>, and the obviously praiseworthy design though, few have anything else to say about Castro because really, there isn&#8217;t all that much to this app.</p>

<p>Linked to <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnblanc/status/410457204450263040">by Shawn Blanc</a>, this is absolutely hilarious. Coincidentally Marco just posted an article titled <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/10/siri-accuracy-improving"><em>Siri Accuracy Continues to Improve</em></a>, where he complained about Siri&#8217;s frequent inability to process his requests. Since I finally upgraded to a 4S last month I have been using Siri daily, and with the exception of a few incorrect words it has worked both flawlessly and exceptionally quickly regardless of my cellular connection strength. I have yet to see see the, &#8220;Sorry, I can&#8217;t take requests right now&#8221; error message.</p>

<p>I have spent the last two or three months occasionally hearing Aaron Mahnke and Dave Caolo talk about an app capable of completely cutting a computer off from a certain set of domains as a means to increase productivity. By making it impossible for one to get distracted, the creators of the aptly-named SelfControl reason, productivity must increase accordingly. I downloaded SelfControl Sunday night, and even in my brief experience with it so far I can attest to its effectiveness.</p>

<p>After my <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/disavow-gaming.html">disavowal of gaming</a> I wanted an insurance policy, something I could fall back on if boredom struck and my resolve faded. Thanks to Dave and Aaron on <a href="http://5by5.tv/homework">Homework</a> it only took me a few minutes to find, download, and open SelfControl. An open-source app aiming to remove the greatest obstacle to productive work&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely, your own resolve&#160;&#8212;&#160;SelfControl works by allowing users to define a list of sites to block and then irrevocably preventing their computers from accessing those domains for a set period of time. No amount of <a href="https://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ#q-i-did-some-stuff-with-the-terminal-that-i-read-on-a-cool-tech-site-but-it-didnt-work-what-do-i-do-now">terminal work</a> can reverse this action, nor can <a href="https://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ#q-i-deleted-the-application-will-that-do-anything">deleting the app</a> or even restarting your computer; once SelfControl&#8217;s timer has begun its countdown, the specified domains might as well not exist.</p>

<p>Personally, this is exactly what I needed. Now I not only have my own resolve to lean on, but should all else fail I have no way of falling back on my unproductive ways; now I really have absolutely no excuse.</p>

<p>Sunday evening shortly after I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/disavow-gaming.html"><em>The One Where I Disavow Gaming</em></a>, as I scrolled through Zite looking for something to read, I happened across a headline that immediately caught my attention: <a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2013/12/iphone-6-release-date-apple/"><em>iPhone 6 Release Date And Recent Rumors</em></a>. Given that the article came from a site I had never heard of before and because the Apple sphere has remained relatively quiet with regards to iPhone 6 rumors as of late, I opened the article with low expectations. What could Value Walk know that John Gruber didn&#8217;t? Turns out, absolutely nothing. In fact, the extraordinary simplicity of these rumors and the fact that one would devote an entire section to speculating as to the iPhone 6&#8217;s release date were so absurd that it made me realize something rather profound.</p>

<p>As the old adage goes, it takes losing something to realize its true value. We&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I hesitantly include myself in this group&#160;&#8212;&#160;who write and talk about Apple and the broader topic of technology often criticize &#8220;the Apple rumor mill&#8221; for its willingness to jump on even the most absurd gossip in the hopes of further substantiation as time goes on. However, outside our small, well-read bubble an entire world exists full of people who have no idea Apple will make an iPhone 6, let alone whether it will come out in Fall or Spring, and that&#8217;s to say nothing of the latest hot topic speculating as to the plausibility of Apple&#8217;s next iPhone featuring sapphire glass; the vast majority smartphone users don&#8217;t even know what that is. Yet we are so quick to critique a writer who goes out on a limb to say, &#8220;Look, this could possibly happen and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; I do not mean to say that we are not justified in our criticisms, for some of the work these sites push out truly is utterly ridiculous, but just that we ought to keep in mind the incredibly high level of discourse we who frequent and work in the Apple-centric tech press enjoy.</p>

<p>As I write this I have wasted almost an entire weekend. I got home Friday afternoon and spent the evening collecting gift ideas for my family and playing a video game; Saturday I wrote the first draft of an essay and reviewed three months&#8217; worth of notes for an upcoming exam all before lunchtime, then proceeded to waste five hours playing that same game before cramming <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/missing-the-forest-for-the-trees.html">an article</a> in with one foot out the door as I prepared for my girlfriend&#8217;s choir concert that evening. After the concert we went to a party. Sunday morning I dragged myself out of bed for church, and then proceeded to spend the rest of my day playing video games once again. I have probably spent just as much time gaming this weekend as I have sleeping, and I really despise this about myself.</p>

<p>You see, this is by no means an isolated incident: every weekend for the past three weeks I have spent my time similarly. While the surrounding activities changed&#160;&#8212;&#160;I don&#8217;t vanity shop for gifts every Friday, nor does my girlfriend have a concert every weekend either&#160;&#8212;&#160;the inordinate amount of time I devoted to gaming remained constant. In between games I would briefly consider writing or even just fishing something out of a nearly five hundred line text file full of ideas and potential topics, but that never happened. Or maybe I could start that site revamp I&#8217;ve been thinking about lately, or spend some quality time tinkering with FirstCrack. And then there&#8217;s always the elephant in the room of learning iOS programming, which I started weeks ago with good intentions but as of yet have succeeded in nothing more spectacular than defining variables and printing them to the screen. But all those require so much <em>effort</em>, effort I apparently don&#8217;t possess.</p>

<p>Now, I can&#8217;t say those hours were a complete waste: while playing I also listen to podcasts, so this time has allowed me to plow through approximately forty episodes of Home Work and Systematic at 2x<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> since Friday evening. However, this certainly was not the best use of my weekend, and given the lengthy roster of projects on my someday-maybe list I would have much rathered spend such a long period working on them instead of wiling my time away at a pastime that could in no way positively impact my future at literally any point in time.</p>

<p>I say that I want to become a well-respected and popular blogger, yet I spend the days I have the most free time to devote to this professed dream doing anything but pursuing that goal; I think about a future wherein I get to spend my entire day at home with my wife writing while still in my twenties or early thirties, yet I regularly confound every effort that would bring me closer to that dream. I justify this behavior by calling it &#8220;relaxation&#8221; or by saying that after a full week of nine and twelve hour days I have earned some time doing nothing, but in actuality it is procrastination, plain and simple, and in reality I have not come anywhere close to earning an entire weekend mindlessly tapping the W, A, S, and D keys for hours on end. So this is me publicly disavowing gaming of all sorts, both on my computer and on iOS. No longer will I take the easy way out. I won&#8217;t cut all leisure from my life cold turkey, as they say, but instead of three hour stretches lost in faux-3D world I will spend thirty minutes watching an episode of Family Guy, or&#160;&#8212;&#160;at the most&#160;&#8212;&#160;an hour with an episode of The Sopranos. You may think it trite or a plea for attention, my decision to so publicly declare my faults and profess dedication to a resolution, but I see no other way; I obviously do not possess the willpower to do this on my own. Next weekend when I get home having finished the last of my semester exams and in the face of an entire month of free time, and I invariably start thinking about playing my favorite game for just a bit, I want to open my own website and see this public reminder of my commitment to doing something meaningful with my time. So here&#8217;s to an end of habitual procrastination, and the beginning of my dreams.</p>

Since I started listening to podcasts quite some time ago, I have steadily increased my tolerable playback speeds up to a point where I not only understand shows played back at double speed, but actually can&#8217;t listen to a program at anything less than true 1.5x (which, confusingly, would be labeled &#8220;2x&#8221; on iOS podcast apps. See Marco&#8217;s aforecited post for details.). Anything below that threshold actually has the opposite effect one might assume, where the incredibly fast pace of 2x forces me to pay attention while at 1x I have a hard time keeping my mind from wandering.</p>

<p>With the release of Tweetbot 3 Tapbots brought a complete user interface overhaul to the beloved Twitter app alongside a whole slew of other improvements and changes. One such change saw the removal of both Tweetbot&#8217;s double- and triple-tap functionality. Citing increased responsiveness as the app would no longer have to wait for iOS to discern whether the user intended multiple taps, Tapbots replaced this feature with a curious swipe gesture. Believing it would work similarly to Mailbox&#8217;s finicky yet workable gestures where swiping different distances invoked different actions, I looked forward to this improvement; however, in this regard Tweetbot 3 fell far short of excellence.</p>

<p>Currently swiping roughly 1/3 of the way from left to right pulls a retweet icon in from the side, indicating that if I lifted my finger Tweetbot would prompt me to either quote the selected tweet or retweet it to my followers. Swiping much further, at around halfway across the screen, a reply icon slides into view. Given that Tweetbot does not provide for its users to change the action associated with a long swipe, it obviously considers this the most important function one would wish to expedite. I could live with this if approximate distances I could eventually relegate to muscle memory were the only complications over simply tapping the screen multiple times, but unfortunately Tapbots decided to add a second criteria for determining the intent of my gestures. Ironically, they chose time. In fact, the time trigger&#160;&#8212;&#160;counterintuitively especially given its designation as a &#8220;Short Right Swipe&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;actually supersedes gesture length: if I swipe from left to right without coming anywhere near the screen&#8217;s halfway point but do so quickly, Tweetbot interprets that as a long swipe and fires the reply action. I find this annoying at times, and on occasion infuriating.</p>

<p>Unlike the vast, vast majority of Twitter users, I predominantly use the service as a consumption platform rather than a creation one. If you likened Twitter to Tumblr, I only created an account to follow other blogs rather than create my own. Granted I do tweet on occasion, but most of the time I sit back and let others do the talking. As a result, I retweet <em>a lot</em> and favorite as a means to save particular tweets or conversation threads should I ever wish to go back and reference a particular exchange. The likelihood of this aside, my primary use for Twitter lies in its ability to facilitate succinct conversations of which I can participate in a tertiary role with the option of greater involvement should the situation call for it. Given this use case Tapbots modifying the feature I used more often than any other impacted my daily workflow greatly, and in a negative way.</p>

<p>Previously, I could scroll through my timeline, absently triple-tap a tweet, and retweet it all without any conscious effort: consistent spacing allowed muscle memory to take over as soon as I found a noteworthy tweet; habit took care of the rest. In Tweetbot 3, however, I not only have to be sure not to exceed the requisite distance, I must also make a conscious effort to keep that gesture within the appropriate amount of time for a retweet instead of a reply. As I said earlier I find this incredibly frustrating especially when I fail in one regard or another, but particularly annoying because it now takes considerably longer to fulfill the one job I ask Tweetbot to do. Perhaps this change led to a net increase in Tweetbot&#8217;s speed, but at least for me I not only have to spend much more time executing basic commands, but I must also spend much more effort ensuring I get the result I intend. In my mind, this is no improvement&#160;&#8212;&#160;speed bump or not.</p>

<p>Every time I save an article to Instapaper I immediately open the app to make sure it actually went there. Although quite some time has passed since this proved a worthwhile exercise, my unfortunate habit stems from a fear derived of Instapaper&#8217;s past inability to parse <a href="http://freecabinporn.com">Cabin Porn</a> URLs. Because I once had faith in the system I happily sent every post I planned to write about over to Instapaper, intending to come back to those articles at a later date. However, this practice came back to bite me when Instapaper failed to accurately record the correct article URLs, much less successfully parse their contents, and I lost several weeks&#8217; worth of effort spent in aggregation. I seem to remember something similar happening with other sites around this time, but Cabin Porn is the sole site that Instapaper consistently failed to handle appropriately.</p>

<p>Instapaper has gotten a lot better server-side lately, with faster, more reliable syncing and fewer errors in parsing content, but in the end these improvements are all for naught because the original, rock-solid trust I once had in the app is gone. Trust once had and then lost is much more difficult to regain than gaining one&#8217;s trust at the onset. Something to keep in mind when developing anything that touches personal data.</p>

<p>Another unsurprisingly great article from Ben Brooks, and my favorite piece of his for quite some time. I absolutely love how he describes PandoDaily&#8217;s post: in a day and age where everyone pulls their punches for fear of offending someone by implying one thing while unconsciously omitting something else and finally ending the sentence with a period, Ben&#8217;s candid characterization is a breath of fresh air. Made all the more worthwhile by his ultimate point, I could not recommend that you go read Ben&#8217;s article and subscribe to his site more strongly. I have been <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/an-annoyance-driven-blog-post.html">critical</a> of his <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/goodbye-dropbox.html">views</a> in the past, but at the end of the day his site is consistently one of my favorites.</p>

<p>While neither a fan of DROdio&#8217;s website or the author&#8217;s writing style, <a href="http://danielodio.com/dissecting-coins-massively-successful-product-launch"><em>Dissecting Coin&#8217;s Massively Successful Product Launch</em></a> nevertheless gives me a way in to talk about Coin once again. Last month, shortly after Coin launched to great fanfare, I condensed some of my thoughts into a post titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/thoughts-regarding-coin.html"><em>Thoughts Regarding Coin</em></a>. I explained the device&#8217;s premise, areas I thought it would excel, and those in which I felt it would fail or needed improvement. I did not, however, go into some of my less tangible concerns with the product; specifically, I did not talk about any of my issues with its marketing and pre-launch strategy. Given that Daniel devoted a significant amount of time to this topic in his article though, I feel now is as good a time as any.</p>

<p>Daniel cites urgency and the sense of getting a deal as the third reason behind Coin&#8217;s impressive success; personally, I would place those two at the top of my list. After scrolling past a number of tweets about Coin, I finally opened the website. As soon as I did, I saw a banner explaining that early adopters had a very limited window in which to place an order before the price shot up to $100 and availability ceased until sometime in 2014. These two aspects served as the primary motivation behind my eventual purchase, even more so than Coin&#8217;s actual value proposition. I didn&#8217;t like that then and I like it even less now; it&#8217;s shady and dishonest. In search of an apt analogy, I decided this was not unlike actually setting something on fire during a fire drill just to motivate everyone to move faster, only to then reveal the faux emergency as a ploy to beat last month&#8217;s evacuation time. If you have a truly great product, don&#8217;t resort to questionable marketing tactics and instead let that product be its own marketing. I can&#8217;t argue against the effectiveness of this strategy, but I can criticize it nonetheless.</p>

<p>Shady tactics aside though, their tactics would have angered me much less if Coin had actually stuck to its promise. Part of the reason I purchased Coin after so little consideration was the specter of a ticking clock counting down the seconds until I would have missed my opportunity. Nearly a month later though, Coin still has a week left before it&#8217;s &#8220;early adopter&#8221; discount ends, and that&#8217;s assuming they actually stick to that date. All things considered, I have my doubts.</p>

<p>Speaking of dishonesty, that $50,000 startup goal&#160;&#8212;&#160;the supposed reason everyone&#8217;s credit cards were charged $50 immediately&#160;&#8212;&#160;also appears to have been a sham. At this point it shouldn&#8217;t surprise me anymore, but it does, and it annoys me greatly. Part of the appeal in helping fund a conceptual product like Coin is the feeling of having helped bring a product into existence by providing a form of venture capital. Although I cannot speak from experience, I would venture to guess that this is one of the primary reasons Kickstarter has grown so popular as of late. Incidentally, this was an ancillary motivation behind my decision to back Coin. However, Coin shat all over this as well. Shocker. I don&#8217;t mind that they continued to take more orders after reaching their goal, but some sort of acknowledgment would have been nice. A simple, &#8220;Wow, we fulfilled our initial goal in less than an hour. We&#8217;re amazed and humbled by your response to Coin! In order to bring Coin to even more people, we have expanded our initial plans to facilitate even <em>more</em> cards, so be sure to tell your friends!&#8221; Fine, that&#8217;s all well and good&#160;&#8212;&#160;great, actually; I can get behind this. But when the company says nothing and continues to rake in money hand over fist I have an increasingly harder time believing the entire strategy was designed as nothing more than an elaborate Pebble-esq fundraising ploy where we will not see any return on our investment for years to come.</p>

<p>In the end I don&#8217;t regret purchasing a Coin, but the entire affair leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. How about a little less time talking about preventative measures to make it impossible for waiters to change the card Coin charges for a meal and more time spent on those apparently difficult principles of honesty and communication? I&#8217;d back that.</p>

<p>&#8220;After 3 weeks, I&#8217;m actually leaning slightly more towards the mini if I had to pick one. Though I do work a lot from my iPad, the iPad is not my main work machine. I still spend most of my time at my desk working from my MacBook Air. And so, for the things I do use an iPad for, the iPad mini is better for about 80-percent of them and &#8216;good enough&#8217; for the other 20-percent. I plan to keep using both iPads, side by side, for at least another month or two, so I&#8217;ll check back in again soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>As an avid iPad user&#160;&#8212;&#160;although less so <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html">lately after purchasing my MacBook Pro</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have followed this discussion with great interest since the retina iPad Mini&#8217;s launch. Of all the articles I have seen so far, Shawn&#8217;s is one of the best.</p>

<p>I love overachievers in the world of cars much more than in person, hence my unbridled enthusiasm when <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/superhero-vehicles.html">I happened across</a> Mercedes&#8217; six-wheeled monster the G63 AMG and Ghe-O&#8217;s indomitable Rescue. Something about these <em>trucks</em>, for their rugged ability to tackle literally any terrain imaginable truly epitomizes the colloquial definition of the term<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, awakens a visceral desire to pack my backpack and spend a long weekend trekking through uninhabited back country with nothing but my thoughts to keep my company; they ignite within me a base midwestern American desire to go outside and spend time in nature. Unsurprisingly, then, Filson&#8217;s Jeep 4x4 was no exception. My only hesitation in pushing its limits on a narrow mountain trail would be that I tarnish its carefully crafted exterior and spoil the bespoke interior; once I got past that though, I have no doubt it could handle anything I decided to throw at it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to go on a rant, but as a brief aside I do not understand the appeal of such small trucks. I can see the place of cars, vans, SUVs, and F-150-esq trucks in the jobs consumers hire vehicles to do, but when it comes to these small &#8220;trucks&#8221; I am at a loss. Granted, their perpetuated existence indicates continued demand for such a form factor, but I can&#8217;t for the life of my understand its appeal. Perhaps this is the naivety of youth and machismo of a nineteen-year-old speaking, but if I had the need for a flat bed and an additional four miles to each gallon without the bulk of an F-150 or above&#160;&#8212;&#160;the only reasons I could see someone purchasing one of these vehicles&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would swallow my second and third criteria and buy a Ford F-series anyways.</p>

<p>Towards the end of <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/amazon-benefits-vision/"><em>Amazon and the Benefits of Vision</em></a> Ben Thompson explained the importance of vision&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the consequences of a deficiency in this department&#160;&#8212;&#160;using many of today&#8217;s top tech companies as examples. At that point not particularly interested in Amazon&#8217;s alleged plans slated for years down the road,, I found this all too brief examination much more fascinating than his actual topic. And then I read <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/12/amazon-drones-and-pre-lobbying.html">an article by Kevin Roose of the New York Magazine</a>, which John Gruber linked to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/03/amazon-drones-lobbying">on Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p>Up until I read Kevin Roose&#8217;s piece, most of the articles reporting on Amazon&#8217;s interesting plan to employ octocopter drones for delivering packages in thirty minute or less approached the topic from one of two directions: as an expose laying out the numerous benefits such a program could provide consumers, or from a more critical perspective as the writer sought to discredit Amazon&#8217;s strategy using the numerous barriers implementing such a system faces. Some naturally took the middle road, but most erred to one side or the other. Then John Gruber linked to Kevin Roose&#8217;s article, where Kevin glossed over the points others had devoted entire articles to and put forth a different explanation: that Jeff Bezos had used this announcement to influence legislators towards favorable regulation regarding drones at the risk of angering their constituents who&#160;&#8212;&#160;given the widespread adulation Amazon has received since unveiling this delivery plan&#160;&#8212;&#160;have taken quite a liking to these little aircrafts.</p>

<p>When Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post earlier this year, many speculated as to his motives. By far and away the most interesting reason I saw <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-06/bezos-washington-lobbying-creates-tricky-issues-for-post.html">some</a> put forth was in the regulatory influence this purchase would give Jeff Bezos and, by extension, his company Amazon. If true, the drone fanfare Bezos enabled makes for an especially interesting event given the influence he wields with the capital&#8217;s hometown newspaper, regardless of whether or not Amazon ultimately delivers on this project or not.</p>

<p>Many have said this before, but I will say it again: Jeff Bezos is a fascinating man. In the coming weeks and months as Jeff Bezos continues to navigate political channels and potentially exert greater influence in the political sector by making use of his station as owner of the world&#8217;s most popular retailer and The Washington Post both, I can&#8217;t wait to see what he decides to advocate. A unique combination for sure, and thus an intriguing one as well. Drones now, but what next? Bezos for President? This definitely won&#8217;t be the end of this topic: Amazon has a long and costly road ahead of it mired in legislation, to name just one obstacle barring its entrance into the market, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/03/ack-ack">and fickle emotions of the masses</a>. It is, however, inarguably an intriguing start, and perhaps indicative of Jeff Bezos&#8217;s future plans.</p>

<p>Starting with November month, I have decided to take a different approach to posting links to cabins I find inspiring, attractive, or otherwise worthy of note: rather than make an individual post each time I come upon such a structure, from here on out I will hold them for the end of the month when I can collect my favorite posts and pictures. This will not only reduce the volume of &#8220;Wow.&#8221; and &#8220;Beautiful.&#8221; one-word link posts I have made a habit of publishing since discovering the Cabin Porn Tumblr last year, but will also allow me to centralize these relevant thoughts into a single monthly post.</p>

<p>On November third, Cory Weidenbach posted a picture of a &#8220;<a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/65890726507/massive-treefort-in-the-catskills-of-new-york">massive treefort in the Catskills of New York</a>.&#8221; Growing up I would have <em>loved</em> a house like this. Honestly though, who am I kidding&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would still love to have a house like this.</p>

<p>On the topic of tree houses, I also really liked this one in <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/66276868941/treehouse-in-swanzey-new-hampshire-contributed">Swanzey, New Hampshire</a>. Much higher off the ground and slightly more modestly built, this would be more my style. Not that I would complain either way though, mind you.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn.html">Since I discovered</a> almost a year ago now it has shown me some amazing videos, like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/13641808772/this-must-be-the-place-by-lost-found-films-50"><em>This Must Be The Place</em></a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/48864768"><em>The Smokehouse</em></a>. On November twentieth the site&#8217;s editors once again found another great video, this time about a <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/67562876517/meet-jay-nelson-professional-fort-builder-on-the">professional fort builder</a>. I love these videos.</p>

<p>And finally, towards the end of November an <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/68058008660/ice-house-near-lake-placid-ny-contributed-by">ice house near Lake Placid, NY</a> popped up, and despite not technically a cabin I couldn&#8217;t help but include it here. I have always wanted to visit upstate New York to see this sort of beautiful natural scenery in a place only known for its bustling cities. Perhaps someday on my way to Maine.</p>

<p>Although I failed to post this on December 1st as I had originally planned, I see it as a way to leave room for improvement next month.</p>

<p>When news of a new currency dubbed &#8220;Bitcoin&#8221; first began circulating, I paid little attention: it seemed like a fad, something no one would remember in a month or two. Instead of fading away though, Bitcoin continued to gain popularity until not a day went by without someone writing an article either glorifying the currency for its upsides or crucifying it for any number of perceived downsides, whether real or not. An interesting parallel could be drawn between these fickle emotions and the manner in which many publications report on certain topics as of late, but I will let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

<p>Because I had no more than a passing interest in Bitcoin given my general distaste of the discussions surrounding it and those who participated in said forums, it came as a great surprise when late last month I inadvertently discovered that the internet&#8217;s favorite legal tender had peaked at over <a href="http://www.bitcoincharts.com/charts/anxhkUSD#rg60ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv">$1200</a>. Fortunes a long time in coming had been made overnight. I considered writing this article amidst the buzz after a &#8220;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/18/5119062/senate-committee-hearing-on-bitcoin">surprisingly friendly senate hearing</a>&#8221; on the subject, but this surprising surge and the <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/thoughts-on-bitcoin">articles</a> that came out of it finally prompted me to sit down and lay out some of my thoughts on this topic.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspects of Bitcoin lie in its dissimilarities to traditional coinage: whereas the United States Government highly regulates America&#8217;s currency, one of Bitcoin&#8217;s main draws is its decentralized and anonymous nature. Rather than <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/currency7.htm">faith</a> and <a href="http://wfhummel.cnchost.com/dollarstandard.html">fiat</a>, Bitcoin&#8217;s base worth stems from the much more tangible anonymity it affords, and its value from the economics of supply and demand facilitated by its cryptographic origin. This is an extremely important point, so I will return to it in a moment. The fact that theoretically anyone can make&#160;&#8212;&#160;or mine&#160;&#8212;&#160;it makes Bitcoin an even more interesting proposition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the plague of market instability overshadows these upsides almost to the point of making them irrelevant. Herein lies the greatest barrier to entry preventing widespread adoption of Bitcoin in any meaningful capacity: whereas the previously cited U.S. dollars derive their value from complex yet <a href="http://useconomy.about.com/od/inflationfaq/p/Value-Of-Money.htm">quantifiable sources</a>, Bitcoin&#8217;s value flows from intensely personal aspects like anonymity, and thus fluctuates quite literally with the whims of the market. Until those sentiments stabilize, then, the price of Bitcoins will remain in flux. As to whether that will ever happen, however, I have my doubts.</p>

<p>The guarantee of privacy makes Bitcoins worth some number more than $0. In other words, it makes them not worthless; anonymity gives Bitcoins a value proposition. Given the cryptocurrency&#8217;s popularity, a sizable contingent holds this offering in high esteem. Bitcoin&#8217;s value, on the other hand&#160;&#8212;&#160;as opposed to its worth, which I believe is a very important distinction to make&#160;&#8212;&#160;flows from two sources: a limited quantity in circulation, and a diminishing supply flowing into the market as the total number of Bitcoins <a href="http://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins">closes in on its ceiling of 21 million</a>. Interestingly, in either&#8217;s absence Bitcoin would inevitable fail: if an unlimited number of Bitcoins existed in the market, it would hold no monetary value given that anyone could obtain any number of Bitcoins at a moment&#8217;s notice without effecting the total supply available to others. Alternately, in the absence of a concrete ceiling and only hindered by its rate of production, Bitcoins would eventually saturate the market leaving us with the scenario I just described. Back to my point though, given that Bitcoin&#8217;s value is based on such a subjective notion as anonymity I have a hard time believing it will ever settle enough to serve as a viable currency.</p>

<p>In the volatility of Bitcoin we draw an interesting parallel to the stock market: just as when purchasing a stock, the only guarantee anyone will see any return from buying Bitcoins today is speculative at best. Worst case scenario, the price of Bitcoins has peaked and will only plummet from here, leaving those in possession of the currency with nothing more than useless 1s and 0s. Best case scenario, on the other hand, Bitcoins could continue their impressive climb in value and anyone lucky enough to have bought low will make significant returns on their investment. The exact same thing could be said for trading stock. As I said earlier, this instability is the primary reason for its modest uptake relative to the world&#8217;s population. One could argue that a general lack of willingness amongst vendors contributes to the issue of mediocre adoption, but in doing so we would be forced to come to terms with the proverbial chicken and egg conundrum: does widespread adoption beget widespread implementation, or is it the other way around? Personally, I subscribe to the former rather than latter theory. Unlike people, businesses are generally not opinionated: their sole goal is not to put forth any single methodology over another, but to take as much of your money as they can while keeping you reasonably satisfied; as to what form that money takes, businesses have no&#160;&#8212;&#160;or should have no&#160;&#8212;&#160;preference so long as it carries the appropriate value. If consumers genuinely wish to pay using Bitcoins, then, it would be foolish for businesses to oppose it. Consumers are not fervently advocating for the adoption of Bitcoins, however, because they are unsure of its future. Solve that single problem and everything else will fall in line.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-11-27 09:25:16-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-11.html">11</a>/27 09:25:16 EST</time>
<p>I love The Verge&#160;&#8212;&#160;I really do. Not long after posting <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>, where I took Josh Topolsky to task for his wholly inappropriate reaction to many justifiable criticisms regarding his publication&#8217;s device reviews, I subscribed to The Verge. Today it not only serves as my primary news source, but I also follow The Vergecast and tune in for their live coverage of Apple&#8217;s events. Lately, however, I have been increasingly disappointed with their work.</p>

<p>The Verge started out as a publication geared towards geeks, covering tech topics and providing device reviews; at its launch, the site marketed itself as&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least appeared to&#160;&#8212;&#160;the news source for those who had no interest in traditional channels. As such, it quickly gained great popularity amongst the tech elite and common folk alike. Recently though, I have watched The Verge slowly diverge<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> from its original path and branch out in an effort to become the very news outlet it sought to obviate at its inception.</p>

<p>Ernest Hemingway once said, &#8220;You go bankrupt in two ways: gradually, then suddenly.&#8221; The Verge&#8217;s journalism has declined in a similar way: earlier this month they posted their first ridiculously titled article, which I just <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/397344923705671680">couldn&#8217;t resist chiming in on</a>: &#8220;Helium-filled hard drives balloon storage space&#8221;.</p>

<p><em>Ugh</em>.</p>

<p>In my mind, this marked the beginning of that sudden phase Ernest Hemingway spoke of. From yesterday: <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/405430356037218305"><em>The CIA reportedly turned some Guantanamo Bay detainees into double agents to fight al-Qaeda</em></a>. <em>How</em> is this news? If Homeland<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> has taught us anything, <em>that&#8217;s the game</em>: you capture someone and turn them, simple as that. Absolutely no one should be surprised by this. And then from earlier today, <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/405642475043168257"><em>NSA spied on porn habits of Muslim &#8220;radicalizers&#8221; in efforts to discredit them</em></a>. If I had to list ten reasons the NSA could use to explain spying on a foreign national, discrediting a radical leader in the eyes of his followers would have been in the top five. These are <em>not</em> news stories; these are pleas for pageviews.</p>

<p>They say a country is not a democracy until the group in power peacefully hands the reigns over to the next as dictated by the populace&#8217;s wishes. This event occurred in American history with the rise of the Jeffersonians usurping Washington&#8217;s government in a landslide victory. I don&#8217;t think it would be altogether inappropriate to place a similar qualification on a website becoming something more than a glorified blog: you are not a true news outlet in the traditional sense of the word until you run a sensationally-titled article with no bearing on your original direction for no other reason than attracting pageviews; the corollary being that in order to stay the devolution into mass-market media outlet one must say no to publishing an article not in line with the publication&#8217;s original direction based on principle. Failing that, just as the peaceful transition of power in a government solidifies it as a functioning democracy, with a single piece you will have signaled the transition to a mainstream news outlet. In the last month in particular, The Verge has finally managed to cross that Rubicon. Unfortunately, they never intended to. They marketed themselves as something more&#160;&#8212;&#160;something different that the status quo. In the end, though, nothing really changed.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;I&#8217;m so, so sorry.</p>

<p id='fn2'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref2'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Please, I say that in obvious jest; to compare a television drama to real world espionage is a farcical comparison.</p>

<p>Back in May I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeons-experiment.html"><em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em></a> where I talked about the network&#8217;s hit animated series <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> and its sequel, <em>Avatar: The Legend of Korra</em>. Last week the latter&#8217;s show finished its second season with the final episode of &#8220;Book Two: Spirits&#8221;. In preparation for the third, I thought I would post a mid-series update. As with my last article on this topic, spoiler alert, I will give away big parts of the story in this piece; if you haven&#8217;t seen the excellence that is Nickelodeon&#8217;s Avatar franchise, read the next two paragraphs and then go watch it before continuing on.</p>

<p>Obviously I recommend starting with Avatar: The Last Airbender and watching from episode one. After that, however, the most advantageous path becomes much less clear: convention would suggest immediately moving to The Legend of Korra, but I have an alternate route to put forth: after Avatar: The Last Airbender&#160;&#8212;&#160;which I will henceforth refer to as &#8220;The Last Airbender&#8221; for both your sake and mine, although I must caution you <em>not</em> to confuse Nickelodeon&#8217;s animated series with the live action abomination that is Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Studios&#8217; joint venture <em>The Last Airbender</em> released in July of 2010&#160;&#8212;&#160;read <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Promise</em>, followed by <em>The Search</em>. Although not yet released as of this writing, their three-part sequel <em>The Rift</em> is slated for March fifth of 2013.</p>

<p>Despite seeming trivial when compared to the potential for far reaching global effects certain events in The Last Airbender have, you would be remiss to gloss over these graphic novels as fillers or merely as of negligible import. Historically indifferent to the comic book format myself I did not particularly look forward to reading them, but after spending an afternoon with both The Promise and The Search I now know a great deal more about the seventy year stretch between The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. Moreover, I greatly enjoyed both. After watching The Last Airbender, reading The Promise and The Search, and going through both Book One: Air and Book Two: Spirits, only then will you be ready to proceed.</p>

<p>Book Two: Spirits solidified my belief that The Legend of Korra in particular&#160;&#8212;&#160;and The Last Airbender as well although to a slightly lesser degree&#160;&#8212;&#160;merely appear geared towards children while in actuality would be much more appropriate for an older audience able to grasp the significant undertones present throughout the series. As I explained in <em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em>, these underlying threads include nationalism, government bureaucracy, war, terrorism, industrial expansion, inequality, and civil unrest, along with more germane issues like broken families, depression, and love. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time#Setting_and_mythology">Adventure Time</a>, Avatar&#8217;s creators nevertheless refused to beat their viewers over the head with each issue and instead left their discovery to some thought and imagination; an admirable strategy for sure. Take in tandem with unrivaled quality in America&#8217;s animation industry today, these aspects have lent themselves to The Legend of Korra&#8217;s perception as an anime. Interestingly, one could reasonably make that very case.</p>

<p>Studio Mir, a small animation house from Korea of which I could find precious little information on and whose only major project looks to be The Legend of Korra, animated the entirety of Book One: Air and half of Book Two: Spirits; the other seven episodes, however, fell to the much larger Studio Perrot known in America for its work on shows such as the Naruto and Bleach franchises, and <a href="http://youtu.be/8BomvCbXmL8">infamously amongst animation enthusiasts for its dubious quality</a>.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Giving Nickelodeon the benefit of the doubt and assuming their primary goal in choosing a production house for The Legend of Korra was to end up with a beautifully animated miniseries, they likely chose the small animation studio based on the promise of fulfilling that modest order. When the show&#8217;s popularity skyrocketed, however, and Nickelodeon queued an additional forty episodes, Studio Mir&#8217;s inability or unwillingness to fill this much larger request gave the Japanese animation house Studio Perrot the opening it needed to promise animation of equal quality&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least the perception of such given the target audience&#160;&#8212;&#160;at a similar or decreased rate, thereby allowing them to step in on a trial basis for The Legend of Korra&#8217;s second season. However, I have my doubts: given Nickelodeon&#8217;s animated atrocities I find this course of events altogether unlikely. Instead, I assume exceptional quality came as a happy accident to the main reason Nickelodeon chose Studio Mir&#160;&#8212;&#160;price, which as a small production house they could compete fiercely on&#160;&#8212;&#160;or as a tertiary consideration at best. With a forty episode extension imminent, Nickelodeon needed more bodies to throw at the problem and so they chose Studio Perrot, eager to attach themselves to such a successful project and likely willing to do so for less than Studio Mir while promising similar production values. Unfortunately, Studio Perrot could not hold up their end of the deal and so for The Legend of Korra&#8217;s third season Nickelodeon went back to Studio Mir.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that this is mere speculation, and the reasons behind this juggling of production studios could be much more germane: it could have come about simply as a result of the show going from a miniseries of just twelve episodes appropriate for a small outfit such as Studio Mir to a fifty-two episode monolith which Studio Perrot could handle with fewer complications. Alternately, budgetary restrictions before the show became wildly popular may have also played a role in these transitions. Based on my own observations and given that I could tell no difference between episodes Studio Mir produced and those from Studio Perrot, I suspect nothing more exciting than behind the scenes economics and politics. Most importantly though, regardless of the motivations the result remained constant throughout: The Legend of Korra continues to outdo every animated production on television today.</p>

<p>Although I suspect I am romanticizing The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra&#8217;s Book One: Air, Book Two: Spirits appears to err much farther towards the extremes of childish humor and great intensity. Throughout The Last Airbender the undertones I mentioned earlier remained just that: undertones rather than significant aspects of the story; with The Legend of Korra&#8217;s first season, however, those undertones became key plot elements and the Avatar franchise began to realize its subconscious growth from a children&#8217;s show to one geared towards older audiences. Rather than continuing that trend or performing an about-face, Book Two: Spirits spread out to either side of that third rail of easy fun and bouts of seriousness, osculating back and forth between each extremes often enough to make my head spin. Perhaps this explains the mediocre ending to this second season, whereas instead of <a href="http://youtu.be/1WyCrD_xGsA">an exploding speed boat</a> we saw a hopeful resolution reminiscent of Avatar Aang&#8217;s time. I now realize the impracticality of expecting each run to end in such a wonderfully spectacular, emotionally conflicted way&#160;&#8212;&#160;because seriously, how could you hope to top <em>that</em> ending?&#160;&#8212;&#160;but leading up to Unalaq&#8217;s defeat I nevertheless hoped for a similarly satisfying culmination. I would be wrong to fault its absence though, for whereas Tarlock&#8217;s stunning murder-suicide made for an amazing ending, it also made for a rough transition between seasons; the ending of Book Two: Spirits lends itself to a much smoother transition, which will hopefully pay off sometime in the future.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;While the creator apparently does not grasp even the simplest of mechanics driving the English language, his comments&#160;&#8212;&#160;if you can get past the terrible grammar and godawful punctuation&#160;&#8212;&#160;are quite funny and he does manage to make a number of good points. That said, in the last minutes of his video he posits that the upcoming Lilly the Witch children&#8217;s cartoon has better animation than Naruto Shippuden, and I have to strongly disagree: Lilly the Witch appears to be some strange amalgamation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel">cel animation</a>, faux 3D characters, and 2D drawings mashed together at an incredibly low budget because kids don&#8217;t know any better.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-11-23 09:36:58-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-11.html">11</a>/23 09:36:58 EST</time>
<p>Yesterday morning Brett Terpstra <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/11/22/casting-call-systematic-audition/">posted an article to his blog</a> calling for open auditions to guest on his podcast Systematic. Like many, many others I&#8217;m sure, I made a submission. I briefly introduced myself then, in typical Systematic fashion, went on to my top three picks for the &#8220;show&#8221;. Looking to increase my chances of getting the spot, I decided to make an extra effort by posting an article here in case Brett decides to look for further information on my website.</p>

<p>By his own criteria, Brett is looking for someone good at what they do, have interesting thoughts on technology in their work, amenable to rambling questions, between the ages of 9 and 103, and can make Skype calls between 8 am and 9 pm CST. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I nailed ever requirement in this extremely short five minute window, so let me elaborate on some of the points I made all too briefly:</p>

<p>As I said in my recording, I have been writing for the better part of seven years, albeit off and on at times. This post will mark the 420th article I have posted to my website since starting it less than a year ago shortly after Thanksgiving; that&#8217;s roughly 1.2 posts per day, for the mathematically inclined. So while I do not personally consider myself great at what I do, great at writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially when I read the work of Federico Viticci who cranks out 20,000 word reviews seemingly every day&#160;&#8212;&#160;by most metrics I am nevertheless competent, at the very least. As for having interesting thoughts on technology though, I am much more confident in this regard. Why write if not to say something interesting, after all? And my admittedly small readership seems to agree: for the month of October my site attracted 885 unique visitors, and although this month I have not posted a blockbuster article like <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html"><em>Podcasting State of the Union</em></a>, I am still on track to bring in a respectable number of unique visitors. I don&#8217;t mean to toot my own horn, but I given my track record and hard evidence I feel comfortable saying that I am both good at what I do and have interesting thoughts on technology.</p>

<p>Of his five requirements the third&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;are permissive to rambling questions&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;is perhaps the most difficult to prove. After some thought, it dawned on me: what better way to demonstrate my permissiveness of rambling questions than to demonstrate my own lack of singular focus? And what better way to show my deficiency of focus than to point out my own website, where I write about everything from <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/harry-marks-interviews-matt-alexander-on-need.html">fashion</a> to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/retrospectively-thankful.html">life experiences</a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/superhero-vehicles.html">everything</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/wolframalphas-new-data-about-pokemon.html">in</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup.html">between</a>. To say that I am not only permissive to rambling questions but prone to the sort of answers they often give rise to, then, would be a bit of an understatement.</p>

<p>The last two stipulations, that I must be between 9 and 103 and can make Skype calls between 8 am and 9 pm CST, I easily meet. So here&#8217;s to hoping that Brett decides to have me on Systematic at some point in the future. Hopefully you will all hear from me soon.</p>

<p>An interesting story made all the more absorbing by the model Amanda employed in stark contrast to the one nearly all writers in the circles I frequent employ. Whereas we hold the individual&#8217;s reputation on high&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-year-of-firsts.html">I read people, not websites</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;she takes the opposite approach in impersonally finding, occupying, and ultimately cashing out on an existing niche rather than create her own as I and many others are want to do. A thought-provoking approach, to say the least, and inarguably effective: I can&#8217;t argue with her results.</p>

<p>This year marked the first time I have taken any interest in reading long-form hardware and software reviews of any kind. Previously, as I described in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html"><em>Diary of a Convert</em></a>, I rarely made it past the first few pages; this time around, however, I not only plowed through John Siracusa&#8217;s twenty-four page epic, but many others&#8217; as well. I learned a great deal about Apple&#8217;s latest hardware and software offerings through this process, something I look to repeat from here on out. In preparation for next year, then, I paid great attention to reviewers and their work so that rather than shopping around for yet another iOS 8 review next fall, I can instead read the thoughts of a select few writers and in doing so enable myself to devote much more time and energy to my own work, which trends would indicate will increase once more after Tim Cook closes his keynote address.</p>

<p>The day after Apple&#8217;s October iPad event, I posted <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/an-amalgamation-of-reviews.html"><em>An Amalgamation of Reviews</em></a>. As the title suggests, I simply pulled together a list of my favorite reviews from the past twenty-four hours.

<p>For the most part, this list of nine<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> contains every site I plan on returning to next year. Unless another article garners a great deal of attention, I plan on sticking to these writers. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/11/16/gruber-retina-ipad-mini-review">Unlike Marco</a>, who reads none but John Siracusa for his thoughts on Apple&#8217;s latest operating system and John Gruber and Anand Lal Shimpi for device reviews, as of right now I rely on quite a few more sources to aid in forming my own opinions with regards to these annual products. And quite honestly, I&#8217;m fine with that: my life is not so busy as to prohibit a few hours over the course of a couple weeks to reading some independent writers share their opinions. I have not yet reached a place where I have to make a decision between reading great work and fulfilling an obligation, whether that obligation be to my family, a job, or something else. Until such a time when I can no longer read all these articles in good conscience, I will continue to await their yearly publication with great anticipation.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;The observant amongst you may notice that this list does not contain any major sites, save AnandTech: The Verge, TechCrunch, and none of the traditional news publications made the list. This is no mistake: I place much greater stock in the thoughts and opinions of these relatively small, mostly one-man shops than the massive conglomerates. Fortunately, I think many others do as well, and for good reason.</p>

<p>I think about my English classes almost every day when I sit down to write, and even some days when I don&#8217;t. I think about how much I hated them, how I dreaded each pointless class and similarly meaningless assignment, and then I think about the eternal debt of gratitude I owe those three teachers for seeing me through.</p>

<p>You see, by most metrics my behavior exemplified that of a great student: I turned my homework in early, earned excellent grades, and excelled in every possible way. However, that clever facade disguised a terrible pupil: I rarely paid attention in class, never willingly participated, and did the minimum amount of work for an A on my report card. I only put any meaningful amount of effort into the year&#8217;s first essay, which I wrote about Steve Jobs shortly after his passing; after that, I phoned everything else in. Nevertheless&#160;&#8212;&#160;as previously stated&#160;&#8212;&#160;I excelled in every way, relying on innate ability to carry me through the drudgery of English class rather than any semblance of hard work.</p>

<p>By far the exception, this behavior instead typified the rule: history, although enjoyable at different points throughout my high school career, invariably devolved into an exercise in staying awake; I stopped trying after a few weeks in literature. Although to a slightly lesser degree, German, Latin, Spanish, and Chinese all fell into a similar category in that while I could comprehend the importance of each, I still considered this discipline a tedious one.</p>

<p>Then, two years after my last real English class, the proverbial bus hit me as I raked leaves and caught up on Systematic&#8217;s back catalog. On the topic of learning to play the guitar, Dave Caolo made a revelatory remark during <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/15">episode fifteen</a>, around minute 30:43: &#8220;You can&#8217;t break the rules until you fully understand them.&#8221; All throughout my academic life I had approached every subject wanting to skip ahead and discard all the rules without taking any time to understand them. In English class this approach manifested itself in an unwillingness to spend time writing essays defining words and an aversion to diagramming sentences, and a desire to instead focus on writing the sprawling long-form articles I so admired. It took two years and a little help from Dave to realize that spending an entire essay defining a single word&#160;&#8212;&#160;mine was, ironically, &#8220;determination&#8221; at the time&#160;&#8212;&#160;taught me to value the significant nuances of one word over another, and diagramming sentences gave me a firm grasp of the mechanics driving the English language. More than a pointless exercise, introspective essays taught expository writing, and devoting an entire paper to my thoughts on the class provided a great avenue for exploring diplomatically critical essays as I tried to inoffensively convey my disdain for the vast majority of my teacher&#8217;s lessons. Our study of poetry, only rivaled in my unbridled hatred by sentence diagramming, still managed to teach me a great deal about rhythm and flow. More importantly though, studying, memorizing, and ultimately writing poetry put the craft into good writing by revealing it as more than simply depositing one&#8217;s thoughts onto a screen, but an art form I could actually respect.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s to say nothing of the language classes of my youth<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, German, Latin, Spanish, and Chinese. With the exception of Chinese which I still study today, I spent between one and two years learning each. Along with the universal benefits coming from exposure to another culture through its language&#160;&#8212;&#160;the primary upside of familiarizing myself with German, Spanish, and Chinese&#160;&#8212;&#160;acquainting myself with Latin has served me incredibly well as a writer: not only do many English words find their roots in Latin, its function as the building blocks atop of which many Western languages built themselves upon has made it an indispensable tool in my writer&#8217;s tool belt.</p>

<p>Although I could not see it at the time, these classes&#160;&#8212;&#160;these experiences&#160;&#8212;&#160;contributed significantly to making me the person I am today; specifically, to shaping me into the writer I am so happy to have grown in to. I still have a great deal of room for improvement, but without those hours in English class and without the years learning to say &#8220;Hello&#8221; over and over again, I would have much farther to go than I do today. Given the option to do it all over again, I would go right back to sitting in every one of those classes, albeit this time a bit more willingly.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-11-18 08:11:33-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-11.html">11</a>/18 08:11:33 EST</time>
<p>I feel like Gene Munster, where just as he perpetually beats upon his iTV drum so, too, do I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-ipad-pro.html">all</a> too <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/clocking-down-the-mini.html">frequently</a> return to the iPad Pro. Since Apple&#8217;s iPad event, after receiving my MacBook Pro, and all throughout the ensuing period during which I began to define the different roles this new device and my trusty iPad would fill, this topic and Tim Cook&#8217;s comment to that effect have occupied a great deal of my consciousness. Unfortunately, I could find no written record of Tim Cook referring to such a device despite numerous verbal accounts; however, when questioned before October&#8217;s iPad event as to whether Apple would release an iPad Pro, he responded (with a smile) in saying, &#8220;We already make one: the 11&#8243; MacBook Air.&#8221; I find this statement interesting for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>First, I cannot help but think Tim Cook considering Apple&#8217;s 11&#8220; MacBook Air compatible with the job consumers hire an iPad to do a very curious notion in that I believe it fatally flawed. As a tablet, consumers hire iPads to do radically different jobs than MacBook Airs of any size, including the 11&#8221;. Those wanting an iPad Pro do not merely desire a larger device with a keyboard; they want a larger <em>iPad</em> running iOS <em>instead</em> of the hacked-together iPad and Bluetooth keyboard pairing that has sufficed up until now. Even if Apple&#8217;s smallest Airs meet that first criterion, their qualifications do not extend beyond that.</p>

<p>If satisfactory in the first regard, why, then, do consumers reject it based solely upon the second? In other words, why do consumers consider MACOSX<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> such a negative experience as to inhibit the purchase of a device they so clearly desire? The answer to this question, I believe, lies in the iPad&#8217;s perception.</p>

<p>Since debuting a veritable war has raged between two factions arguing not whether iPads had the capability to serve as content creation tools in addition to their undisputed role as top-tier consumption devices, but whether one <em>could</em> create anything meaningful using Apple&#8217;s tablet platform. If this distinction sounds pedantic and nuanced, it is; perhaps therein lies the problem perpetuating this never-ending debate. Over time the likes of Federico Viticci and Horace Dediu began to come forward demonstrating an impressive ability to not only accomplish similar tasks using only an iPad, but to perform those tasks better than previously possible when employing a full-fledged computer. To many, the iPad has obviated the desktop computer for all but a small subset of rare tasks. This near-imperceptible shift soon saw Apple&#8217;s iPads held up as the epitome of productivity, lauded for their greatly simplified environments conducive to the work we as a community prize so highly. The iPad&#8217;s fame came in no small part due to the form factor, but by and large stemmed from the heavy-handed constraints iOS imposed and the ingenuity that it forced as a result. On the other hand, the Mac OS imposes very few such restrictions relative to those of iOS, and accordingly few consider it in as a complementary light.</p>

<p>Even more subtle than form factor and underlying operating system though is the perceptible paradigm shift between these two devices. In most people&#8217;s minds the Mac has become another portal for work; the novelty has worn off just as it did with the PC years earlier. Conversely, the iPad remains a bastion of delightful whimsy kept from going too far in the wrong direction by a strict adherence to the hard and fast&#160;&#8212;&#160;and praiseworthy&#160;&#8212;&#160;guiding principle of simplicity above (almost) all else. The desire for an iPad Pro is a cry for Apple to bring that source of happiness into their work life with an iPad capable of handling their work with ease, while also remaining true to their current perception of the device. I&#8217;d say Apple has their work cut out for them.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ipad-mini-and-ipad-air-first-impressions.html">When linking to</a> Shawn Blanc&#8217;s excellent iPad Mini and Air review I mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/theloop/statuses/400281801924427776">Jim and Marco&#8217;s altercation</a> on Twitter the day before in passing. Brought on when Marco criticized Jim&#8217;s lack of time spent with the Mini preluding an article titled &#8220;review&#8221;, I found the entire exchange humorous and representative of the pair&#8217;s similar personalities. I considered writing this article then at peak relevance, but instead pushed it into Drafts for another time. Four days and two posts later though, the fact that this topic remains at the front of my mind is a testament to the importance of a first impression.</p>

<p>As I said, the argument began with Marco expressing disbelief that Jim would publish an article presuming to call itself a review after &#8220;having it for an hour&#8221;. Jim responded surprisingly agitated, saying, &#8220;don&#8217;t read it, I don&#8217;t give a shit&#8221;. Coming from two incredibly opinionated writers, I thought the plausible criticism and off the cuff response made for an entertaining dialog over the next ten minutes until Daniel Jalkut (rightfully) <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/400285445327953921">put an end to the argument</a>. More interesting than their brief exchange though, I found Marco&#8217;s justifiable critique intriguing, especially after deeming it erroneous.</p>

<p>Whereas Marco devalues the significance of initial impressions, which he rightfully assumed Jim had used to form the entire basis upon which he wrote his article, I would argue that those opinions formed within the first few hours are not only important, but perhaps the most significant ones a user will ever form with regards to any given device. Just as every article I write is a reflection of every word I have read in the past, so, too, will users&#8217; interactions be shaped by the first time they pick up any device, the iPad Mini included. Jim wrote to that singular, incredibly formative experience, and for that I cannot say we should fault him. I do not mean to say that Marco&#8217;s opinion has no merit, for all too many &#8220;writers&#8221; these days post comprehensive, multi-page &#8220;reviews&#8221; after spending less time with a device than I did reading the aforecited Twitter thread, but I do mean to say that maybe, just maybe, there was more to Jim&#8217;s article than one would suppose based upon Marco&#8217;s commentary.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-11-15 10:37:34-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-11.html">11</a>/15 10:37:34 EST</time>
<p>Yesterday afternoon Benedict Evans <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/401038000353992704">had something interesting to say</a> regarding a new product-service pairing called Coin, questioning why anyone considered it anything more than a toy. Having never heard of the site, I continued scrolling until coming across <a href="https://twitter.com/codyfink/status/401039468821745664">Cody Fink&#8217;s referral link</a>, at which point my &#8220;when in doubt wait until more than one person talks about it before taking the bait&#8221; rule kicked in and I opened Coin&#8217;s website. Over the next 1:45 Adam Lisagor serenaded me in a promo video nothing short of beautiful<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that brought me&#160;&#8212;&#160;generally very averse to spending any significant amount of money&#160;&#8212;&#160;the closest I have ever come to impulse-buying anything, and especially something in the neighborhood of $50.</p>

<p>At its heart Coin aims to solve a very simple and base problem: an overabundance of credit card-like shims of plastic cluttering our wallets. Where others have failed though Coin looks to succeed: <a href="http://youtu.be/NLWsK1ZFunA?t=1m5s">by taking the world as it is rather than as we want it to be</a>, Coin accepts the cardholder&#8217;s inevitability by obviating the need to lug that multitude of cards around rather than thinking of a nuance manner in which to package them. In this respect I applaud Coin&#8217;s ingenuity: through the impressive combination of iOS app and physical device Coin enables a single card to serve the purpose of up to eight at any given moment with the simple tap of a button. And for those with more than eight cards, Coin&#8217;s iOS app possesses the capability to store an unlimited number it can then push to the Bluetooth-enabled card for near-instantaneous use.</p>

<p>Coin&#8217;s admirable promises belie a number of potential problems in its implementation details, however. For instance, Matt Gemmell cited one such obstacle yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgemmell/status/401115948155170816">on Twitter</a> where he pointed to a lack of identifying PIN number and an unfamiliar design as a possible hurdle barring social acceptance. Unfortunately, I have to agree: I find it unlikely that the fifty-year-old cashier in Walmart would readily accept this strange little card in lieu of a traditional Visa. Perhaps some explanation and a trial swipe might convince her otherwise, but I fear this problem could recur all too frequently in everyday use to the point where rather than simplifying my life, Coin would instead greatly complicate it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Coin&#8217;s problems do not end here. Going back to its core value proposition of obviating the need to carry around all those pesky cards, I have a hard time believing I could ever shake the nagging fear that one day, at the most inconvenient time possible and when I least expect it, my Coin will cease working. Perhaps the battery dies or the cashier simply refuses to take it; Coin could fail for any number of reasons, leaving me stranded unless I also carried the very cards Coin intends to replace on my person at a times, in which case Coin serves no purpose besides further compounding the initial problem by adding yet another card of dubious value.</p>

<p>Although given a prospective battery life of two years, lacking an obvious meter by which to measure remaining power and unequipped with the ability to recharge Coin could fail at any time, after all. Especially given the state of today&#8217;s battery technology, I have a particularly hard time taking this impressive two year lifespan claim based upon estimates rather than real-world usage at face value. Coin&#8217;s creators seemingly sought to market their product to those looking for the rush born of not knowing whether their credit card would work every time they swiped it. Personally, I have no such desire.</p>

<p>This leads me to the final point I have to make with regards to Coin&#8217;s power source, that of planned obsolescence. Coincidentally this notion and phrase have seen quite a bit of use in the last week or so in conjunction with Catherine Campbell&#8217;s NY Times piece <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/why-apple-wants-to-bust-your-iphone.html"><em>Cracking the Apple Trap</em></a>, which many&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cracking-my-iphone-4.html">myself included</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;chimed in on with wholly-justifiable objections. Given her article&#8217;s popularity I find it ironic that just two days later Coin launched explicitly employing the business model Catherine accused Apple of based on nothing more than anecdotal, touchy-feely evidence. Although a viable strategy whereby Coin generates additional revenue from an existing and presumably growing customer base every two years at the rate of $100 assuming the price does not fluctuate in one direction or the other, I can&#8217;t make it sit right with me. I know I can count on my car for somewhere in the neighborhood of ten years; I expect my computer to have become outdated in two or three years, and my iPhone in just one. However, I also know those devices will remain functional for an additional two at the very least, and my car for as long as I deign to keep it serviced. With Coin, however, there is a relatively hard end date after which the device will become utterly useless and devoid of any possible future use, and that model doesn&#8217;t quite sit right with me. Granted, paying such a negligible amount as $25 in its pre-order phase and $50 regularly per year in exchange for the service Coin could hypothetically provide is by any measure an acceptable exchange, but this largely foreign idea of planned obsolescence makes me uncomfortable as I&#8217;m sure it will make many others, putting up yet another barrier to widespread use.</p>

<p>Speaking of business models and aspects of this product that make me uncomfortable, Coin&#8217;s pre-launch strategy continues to confuse me. In service of raising $50,000 to begin production, Coin sells the promise of a future device for $50 immediately withdrawn from the customer&#8217;s account. I can&#8217;t help but question why Coin decided against Kickstarter&#160;&#8212;&#160;or Indiegogo for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;with such a model that would seem to fit so well within either service&#8217;s core competency. And while I cannot pretend to understand the intricate workings of these crowdfunding platforms, upon cursory inspection their rules do not appear to place any provisions which would restrict a device such as Coin from taking advantage of their services. Why, then, did Coin deign to roll their own &#8220;seed round&#8221;, if you will, rather than go with an established and proven platform? Perhaps for convenience, an unwillingness to forfeit a service fee, a desire to fill orders even if they do not reach the requisite funding amount, or due to a conflict in Kickstarter&#8217;s rules and Coin&#8217;s proposed operational model; we may never know. The cynical side of me, however, tends to err on the less-gracious spectrum.</p>

<p>In the end, nearly all my questions and misgivings regarding Coin come down to one single issue: a deficiency of faith. I lack faith that Coin will work everywhere I need it to, and that even if it did work everywhere I worry few locations will accept it; I lack faith that I will one day swipe my card and find its battery to have died in the night; I lack faith in Coin&#8217;s business model reliant on concurrent $100 purchases every two years. The single most pressing problem, then, the base requirement barring Coin&#8217;s success is that of establishing strong faith and trust in their platform. Solve that problem, my friends, and your road to success will be paved in gold and the shredded remnants of cast aside credit cards.</p>

<p>There are a few other improvements I would be remiss to suggest a this point though, purposely aligning with the misgivings I have regarding this service. Unsurprisingly, the first deals with power: Coin would appear much more attractive with an inductively-charged battery. As this would effectively destroy their model for recurring revenue though, I also have a suggestion there, where one route could see Coin charge separately for said charging station. Those wanting the ability to charge their cards and thus extend its battery life past two years need only purchase a special charing station at, say, $50 a pop. A far cry from the $100 each successive card would generate every two years though, I also recommend taking advantage of a subscription model through Coin&#8217;s iOS counterpart. Relying on constant communication between the card and said app&#160;&#8212;&#160;Adam even demoed the feature in Coin&#8217;s promo video where he walked away from his card, &#8220;like a dummy&#8221;, and it called him back&#160;&#8212;&#160;one alternative business model could entail paying a negligible monthly fee&#160;&#8212;&#160;say, $5&#160;&#8212;&#160;for continued use of Coin; failure to comply would immediately deactivate the card. This would actually generate more revenue than buying a new card every two years&#160;&#8212;&#160;$120 versus $100&#160;&#8212;&#160;while simultaneously cutting down on production costs as Coin must manufacture fewer cards each year and lending itself to an improved user experience as each Coin could, potentially, last much longer than originally planned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both these changes would require an entire overhaul of Coin&#8217;s inner workings given their predication on a rechargeable battery&#160;&#8212;&#160;the first for obvious reasons as an induction charger without a capable battery would serve little use, and the second because a subscription model designed to perpetuate Coin&#8217;s usage in the face of a hard end of life makes equally little sense. Since these suggestions would effect a second iteration then, let me go out on a limb and&#160;&#8212;&#160;blue-sky solutioneering here&#160;&#8212;&#160;suggest a small e-ink display for displaying bar codes. Shopping, library, and even some gift cards rely on these little black lines rather than magnetic strips, making Coin in its current for useless for these applications.</p>

<p>All said and done, despite my misgivings, I have great faith in Coin&#8217;s success: it pushes the boundaries of an established industry with an amazing product that&#160;&#8212;&#160;for all the nitpicky &#8220;flaws&#8221; I pointed out&#160;&#8212;&#160;is incredibly polished on day one, and will only get better. Further, most will not see the absence of an inductive charging system as a downside or look at Coin&#8217;s launch strategy with curiosity born of cynicism; most will see a delightfully attractive black card capable of simplifying their lives replacing the source of their back problems, and for that I believe Coin will succeed. <a href="https://onlycoin.com/?referral=J7uJRc25">I backed it</a>, after all, in anticipation of the day where I can replace every single card in my wallet with One Coin, and to do so indefinitely.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Upon watching Sandwich Video&#8217;s introductory production, questions immediately sprang forth uncalled. Perhaps most important of which, if I held a Coin and flicked my wrist upwards would all my associated cards pop out? For all their cinematographic magic, Sandwich Video did a poor job answering that question.</p>

<p>Shortly after Ole Zorn released Editorial for iPad I adopted a workflow heavily reliant on this and his other&#160;&#8212;&#160;some would say companion&#160;&#8212;&#160;app Pythonista. Employing Editorial for all my writing needs and Pythonista to run a retrofitted version of FirstCrack thus enabling me to post on the go, I read, wrote, and updated my website almost exclusively on my iPad. Although recent months have seen a reversal of that shift in conjunction with my purchase of a new MacBook Pro, certain circumstances still make me thankful for the ability to not only consume but also produce content on such a portable device. Pythonista 1.4 brings a whole host of exciting changes to this already excellent app; perhaps even more exciting, though, is what these changes indicate for the future of Editorial.</p>

<p>Yesterday Jason Snell <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/400363769005486080">made an interesting tweet</a> regarding Apple&#8217;s A7 SoC, presumably after reading the MacRumors article <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/12/retina-ipad-mini-has-1-3-ghz-a7-processor-with-5x-better-performance-than-original-mini/"><em>Retina iPad Mini Has 1.3 GHz A7 Processor With 5X the Performance of the Original Mini</em></a>: &#8220;The iPad Air&#8217;s processor is running at 1.39GHz; the iPad mini&#8217;s is clocked down to 1.27GHz.&#8221; Amidst nearly every discussion surrounding the iPad Mini, especially building up to its release earlier today, much of that discourse has lauded synonymous computing power between both devices as enabling those wishing to buy an iPad to make their decision based purely on form factor rather than performance. Today, however, we find that despite possessing identical processors, the Air will outperform the Mini as many suspected it would leading up to last month&#8217;s event.</p>

<p>Although we may never know the real reason behind this decision, assuming it did not come about in order to extend battery life necessitated by the Mini&#8217;s significantly smaller form factor&#160;&#8212;&#160;my favorite culprit&#160;&#8212;&#160;or reduce problematic heat the device must dissipate over a much smaller area&#160;&#8212;&#160;another viable possibility&#160;&#8212;&#160;leads us to ask some interesting and thought-provoking questions. Given that both tablets shipped with A7s, why not enable them to run at analogous speeds? Equipped with identical screen resolutions and near-identical components the Mini imposes no lesser requirements upon its hardware than its larger sibling demands, so placing this seemingly arbitrary throttle on its processing speed makes little sense unless in service of some future goal. Specifically, I believe that future goal to be an iPad Pro.</p>

<p>Shortly after Apple&#8217;s iPad event last month I wrote and published an article explaining the logic behind an impending iPad Pro, unimaginatively titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-ipad-pro.html"><em>The iPad Pro</em></a>. Using the iPad Air&#8217;s name as the obvious jumping-off point, I pointed to it and the curious absence of an A7X SoC as indicative of Apple&#8217;s future plans in this space. Operating under the impression that more than physical dimensions and price Apple&#8217;s tablet offerings must also differentiate themselves on computing power, I reasoned that in order to launch a third tablet Apple needed a third processor in addition to its two traditional An and AnX chips, and that the A7X&#8217;s truancy preluded a lineup slated for next fall in which the iPad Mini shipped with a &#8220;new&#8221; A7X, the iPad Air with an A8, and the iPad Pro with an A8X. The Mini and Air shipping with identical chipsets and thus indistinguishable performance threw a major wrench into my thought process. Just over two weeks later though, the gaping hole in my theory did an about-face and became a supporting pillar: while clocking the Mini&#8217;s performance down .12GHz does not explain the lack of an A7X, it does lend credence to my notion that Apple feels it must differentiate the iPad line on more than price and form factor. And if Apple is willing to place an artificial restriction upon a device in pursuit of that goal, I have a hard time believing it would not take a step in the other direction by providing a device of intentionally superior computing power than any of its existing offerings. Specifically, I have a hard time believing Apple will not create and release an iPad Pro.</p>

<p>The whole debacle surrounding New York Times writer Catherine Rampell&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/why-apple-wants-to-bust-your-iphone.html"><em>Cracking the Apple Trap</em></a> holds almost no interest to me. However, after <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/60/">yesterday&#8217;s The Talk Show</a> during which John X. Gruber and very special guest Paul X. Kafasis devoted a fair amount of time to ridiculing the entire enterprise, I feel it at least merits some attention.</p>

<p>I have had an iPhone 4 since shortly after the 4S came out; it was a hand-me-down from my mom when she upgraded. For the most part, I have remained very happy with the phone. As time went on though, it began to show its age: through a combination of hard use&#160;&#8212;&#160;I took it on a week-long, 184.5 mile bike trip from Maryland to Pennsylvania equipped with naught but a simple shell case&#160;&#8212;&#160;and age&#160;&#8212;&#160;already two years old at the time of that trip, and more than three now&#160;&#8212;&#160;the lock button has virtually ceased to function, one of the two speakers at bottom no longer works, and I have a sneaking suspicion the battery is no longer what it used to be. Nevertheless, I still enjoy the phone greatly: of all the computing devices I own I easily use it the most. I listen to podcasts, peruse Twitter, and browse RSS feeds exclusively on this almost-four-year-old device despite these faults, and despite the perception of decreased computing power over the years.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t pick apart Catherine&#8217;s article point by malformed point&#160;&#8212;&#160;John and Paul did that well enough on The Talk Show, Gizmodo did an even better job in <a href="http://gizmodo.com/no-apples-not-trying-to-bust-your-phone-1453999009"><em>There&#8217;s No Such Thing As an &#8220;Apple Trap&#8221;</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/10/31/new-york-times-article-laughably-argues-that-apples-iphone-is-d/">TUAW followed suit</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I will, however, speak to my own expectations regarding technology, evidently wildly divergent from hers. Unlike Catherine, I have no expectation that the best device I buy today will remain at the top of the line for even a year, much less three or more. The new MacBook Pro I shelled out a hefty sum for just three weeks ago, I expect it to remain best in class for a year until Apple releases the next generation; any longer than that is an added bonus. And even if Apple does wait eighteen months to update its Pro laptop line, even then I know after that first year my computer is already woefully out of date.</p>

<p>This unrealistic expectation that Apple not only should but could ship technology capable of contending with the latest and greatest devices three years down the road is not only preposterous, but indicative of the light in which many see the world&#8217;s move valuable company. A carryover from the days when Steve Jobs could stand on stage and proclaim that his new phone was five years ahead of the competition, Apple (arguably) cannot still lay claim to such an extraordinary designation. At least, not in this market: with the reasonably adept competitors Catherine cites like Samsung and HTC, the march of progress only allows Apple to remain so far in the lead&#160;&#8212;&#160;and certainly not five years ahead, much less three. Perhaps Apple will be able to once again make a similar claim in the future, but only in another, as of yet untouched by Apple industry where it can come in and blindside the incumbents, catching them with their pants down. It took the mobile phone industry&#8217;s incumbents five years to pull their pants up and start running after Apple, which left us in the situation we find ourselves now where Apple is inarguably the most technologically-advanced phone maker in the world. Until Apple does what it did to the phone industry to another though, Catherine will continue to be disappointed by not only Apple, but every device she ever uses.</p>

<p>Poor Catherine.</p>

<p>In the wake of iOS 7&#8217;s release very few developers skipped the godsend of an opportunity to update their apps and charge once more in the process. Unfortunately, interspersed amongst the Tapbots of Apple&#8217;s ecosystem who shipped a product rebuilt from the ground up, others instead chose a shallow strategy Ben Brooks quantified quite well in the title of his article linking to Chris&#8217;s piece, <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/11/lets-make-it-2-0-so-we-can-charge-for-it-again/"><em>Let&#8217;s make it 2.0 so we can charge for it again.</em></a> Like Chris, I had no problem paying for Tweetbot 3; I happily bought Instacast 4 when it came out too. But by and large those two were the exceptions, not the rule.</p>

<p>Amidst all the hubbub that invariably follows every Apple event as embargoes lift and reviews flood the internet, as writers formulate, present, and respond to thoughts and opinions regarding Apple&#8217;s latest moves, it&#8217;s easy to lose a diamond in the rough. The problem is further compounded when amongst other diamonds, to continue stretching this metaphor, such as John Siracusa&#8217;s famous <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/">Mavericks review</a>. Such was the case when Stephen Hackett posted his own article reviewing OS X 10.9, which I just now got around to reading more than two weeks after its publication. While it will not replace John&#8217;s in-depth analysis and historical perspective I enjoy so much, Stephen&#8217;s much quicker pace and more jovial approach did earn his annual review a spot among those I will look out for and read every year from here on out.</p>

<p>I realize I have come late to the party, but after just two weeks that does not change the relevancy of John Gruber&#8217;s article written in the wake of Apple&#8217;s October iPad event. Many wrote about a single aspect: Marco <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/24/off">chimed in on the presentation itself</a>, and I devoted an entire article to the notion of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-ipad-pro.html">an upcoming iPad Pro</a>; others, <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/10/22/thoughts-on-the-apple-event/">such as Jim Dalrymple</a>, attempted the more monumental task of tackling the entire event; still others put forth more opinion-based pieces, such as Shawn Blanc&#8217;s <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/10/best-in-class-built-to-last/"><em>Best in Class, Built to Last</em></a>. None, however, did such a good job as John in not only conveying his thoughts and observations regarding the event, but presenting both those ideas and Apple&#8217;s announcements in context born from years of experience in this industry.</p>

<p>This is why John Gruber is so famous amongst the generation of writers, and why so many respect him; this is why I read Daring Fireball, for these impressively insightful pieces that inspire me to become a better writer myself. John gives me a bar to strive for, and one that I someday hope to reach.</p>

<p>This completely blindsided me. I had the lack of foresight to uninstall the betas after Instapaper 5 hit the market, so I had no idea a revamped iPad app was in the works until coming across the announcement in my Twitter feed late yesterday evening. Thanks iOS 7&#8217;s automatic update feature, I got to experience Betaworks&#8217; latest revision firsthand as soon as I opened the app; and as I said <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/statuses/398276792198238209">on Twitter</a>, I really like the new design. The folks over at Betaworks also implemented the much-acclaimed sorting and filtering abilities Instapaper 5 for iPhone shipped with three months ago, along with some other, more minor tweaks and updates.

Those original motifs I pushed to the wayside still clamored for attention though, attention that I will grant them in this follow-up piece.</p>

<p>At the onset I began the article that evolved into <em>Need, Fashion, and Matt Alexander</em> as not just a link post, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;more importantly, in my mind&#160;&#8212;&#160;a commentary regarding Harry Marks&#8217; interesting presentation of his interview I found very reminiscent of the best traits print publications had to offer. Namely, in stark contrast to the all-too common laundry list of questions posed and then answered in rapid and brief succession characteristic of interviews posted online, Harry peppered just five throughout his nearly 1700-word article. This great question-to-elaboration ratio did two wonderful things: first, it forced Harry to put a lot of forethought into his queries; with just five available, he was forced to&#160;&#8212;&#160;and did so splendidly&#160;&#8212;&#160;pose only the most pertinent and interesting questions. Equally important, this also allowed Matt Alexander to expound upon his answers in enough detail that I seldom wished for more information. Combined these two aspects lent themselves to a much more fulfilling interview than I see most internet publications squeeze out these days.</p>

<p>As much as I may wish it were so, I did not finish <em>Interview with Matt Alexander of Need</em> and sit back to reflect upon Harry&#8217;s lack of incessant interrogation and an absence of disappointingly brief quips on Matt&#8217;s part. Rather, I scrolled back through the article looking at Harry&#8217;s unique presentation of that content. Complete with well-placed and relevant section headers that served the dual purpose of presenting Harry&#8217;s questions and defining the following paragraphs&#8217; topic interspersed with strategically placed germane and interesting excerpts, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry&#8217;s take on the tried and true interview model.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-11-06 18:56:23-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-11.html">11</a>/06 18:56:23 EST</time>
<p>In the works for <a href="http://mykehurley.net/blog/need">nearly a year</a>, Matt Alexander&#8217;s new startup Need addresses a fascinating deficiency of not just fashion, but any degree of concern with respect to one&#8217;s physical appearance all too prevalent in today&#8217;s society, especially amongst young people. At nineteen a young person myself, I speak from first-hand experience: you would not believe the things I see my peers wearing, especially on a college campus. I am not wholly exempt in this respect&#160;&#8212;&#160;I have worn my fair share of tattered jeans and undershirts in public&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I also have enough sense to realize my shortcomings in this area. And acceptance is the first step towards recovery, right?</p>

<p>Myke Hurley, Matt&#8217;s co-host on the popular <a href="http://tearawaytrousers.com">Bionic</a> podcast, often teases his compadre by calling Need a <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke/statuses/397447870422728705">&#8220;pigeon-scarf&#8221; startup</a>. Unfortunately, and Matt touched on this point all too briefly in <a href="http://www.curiousrat.com/interview-with-needs-matt-alexander">Harry Marks&#8217; launch interview</a>, many consider the idea of the male gender concerned with such a loaded term as &#8220;fashion&#8221; or the semi-obscure notion of style not only strange, but cause for&#160;&#8212;&#160;in some cases&#160;&#8212;&#160;ridicule. Although not directed towards me personally, I have witnessed this very stigmatization in my own life. Understanding where that reaction comes from is the key to mitigating and, eventually, removing it altogether though, and thus a very important step towards the goal Matt set out for Need.</p>

<p>At its core, I believe this widespread aversion to both fashion and style amongst members of the male gender came about as a result of a marked decline in inherent functionality fashion provided in service of a much more subjective aesthetic goal. All hyperbole aside, I believe this transition from utilitarian to far less practical menswear came about thanks in no small part to the covert feminization of the fashion industry as a whole, where over the years feminine undertones have reached across the gender divide and influenced menswear products to a significant degree. Take scarves, for example: while certainly not an accessory exclusively for females, I have a hard time believing a working man woke up one day and decided to wear a colorful affectation around his neck on a whim. In skinny jeans we find yet another prime example of a trend born by crossing the streams, so to speak; one more data point in an industry regression no longer focused on imbued usability and instead geared towards superficial presentation. As a whole males have unsurprisingly witnessed these effects as net negatives, and rather than attempt to remedy the problem abandoned this venture entirely. And so we entered this dark age, or sorts, where it has become socially acceptable to wear nearly anything in public so long as one&#8217;s personal effects remain reasonably concealed.</p>

<p>After such a bout of profoundity, lest Need&#8217;s&#160;&#8212;&#160;and by extension, Matt&#8217;s&#160;&#8212;&#160;newfound devotees jump on poor Myke for his characterization made in jest, let me stress a very important point<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: Myke&#8217;s comment was, in fact, a long-standing joke between the two. And a quite humorous one at that. Getting back to the core issue though, with Need Matt has taken a step towards combating that base aversion to fashion and style amongst men by showcasing not only attractive products, but inarguably useful ones as well. Consider the Style No. 9111 Round Toe Boot from Red Wing Shoes, for example, or Fjallraven&#8217;s Rucksack No. 21: undeniably attractive, these two items also fulfill the duties requisite of their designation as boots and rucksacks. Quite splendidly, I might add. By no means swinging too far in the opposite direction, Need also offers products for the sole sake of satisfying those seeking to differentiate their footwear, such as hook + ALBERT&#8217;s Fire Bootlace.</p>

<p>More important than any number of implicit endorsements though is the impact Need&#8217;s offerings had on me, one who to a fault wears the most casual clothes possible. Although a factor, a lack of interest in fashion is not the whole reason I have disregarded it over the years; rather, more so a lack of interest in expending the requisite energy in order to effect a meaningful change has precluded me from this endeavor, a requirement Matt obviates with Need by selecting none but the best of the best for discerning and aspirational dressers. Therein lies the appeal of his startup, and why I have such high hopes for it; if Need appeals to me, after all, he must be doing something right.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks and months I will definitely keep my eye on both Matt and his startup; I might even buy something on occasion. And who knows: I may start dressing nicely as well.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;The mere fact that I felt any compulsion to do so sickens me, that we would live in <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgemmell/status/397038195093024768">such a society</a> where <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/11/03/tea-sachets">even the slightest misstep</a> might incur the high-brow wrath of uppity armchair activists and that, as a result, creatives would go out of their way to mitigate this potentially damning happenstance in the same way I have just done. But, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html">again</a>, I digress.</p>

<p>Following Apple&#8217;s event last week and after I ordered a top of the line 15&#8220; Retina MacBook Pro, I sat down to read John Siracusa&#8217;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/">famous Mavericks review</a>. I started last year&#8217;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/">Lion review</a> with good intentions, but without any incentive to finish I only read a few pages. This year though, with a shiny new Mac already on its way from China, I finally had more of a reason to persevere than simply to say that I had. Surprisingly, that gray &#8221;24&#8220; page marker&#160;&#8212;&#160;for I read it on Ars just as <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/10/22/mavericks">John suggested</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;turned up much faster than I expected it to after more than 24,000 words; unsurprisingly, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/30/siracusa-mavericks">I enjoyed every minute of John&#8217;s epic</a>. Less than a week later, I received a FedEx email whose subject line told me everything I needed to know: &#8221;FedEx shipment delivered".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to toss my backpack aside and spend the next twenty-four hours playing with this new machine, life stepped in and managed to keep me away for all but the occasional hour once or twice a day. Spread out over Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, despite an extremely short time period I nevertheless managed to form a few general impressions that I believe will successfully extrapolate into future use, which I have laid out here in a semi-orderly fashion.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the MacBook Pro&#8217;s exceptional battery life impressed me early on. Although claiming &#8220;up to 8 hours&#8221; on a single charge, I routinely check the battery status indicator and find much longer than that left on the clock. Right now, for example, having just unplugged my computer at 100<code> capacity, the indicator reads &#8220;9:48 remaining&#8221;; another time, at <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/statuses/395969689395818496">95</code> it claimed 11:08 left</a>. Especially coming from a DELL INSPIRON 15 that rarely got fours hours even just after I bought it<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, this incredible battery life continues to amaze me.</p>

<p>In addition to battery life portability also ranked near the top of my priority list, and the MacBook Pro did not disappoint: not only did I consistently see nearly ten hours with each charge, its slim form factor and high build quality lent themselves to a very solid device I immediately felt comfortable sliding into my backpack without worrying about it getting damaged. My plastic DELL had handled such treatment for five years, after all; this aluminum&#160;&#8212;&#160;or aluminium, as you say&#160;&#8212;&#160;case would have no problem in such an environment, and would occupy considerably less space to boot.</p>

<p>On the topic of space, I have found myself deferring to the MacBook Pro instead of my iPad, which many hold up as the epitome of portability, increasingly often since receiving it. In fact, over the past week I have taken my iPad out but twice to fulfill its previous main draw as a writing machine, whereas its main function has devolved into a note-taking device during class. With comparable battery life and much greater computing power, the Pro is slowly obviating my need for the iPad in almost every capacity save as a device I can watch Family Guy reruns on, and even in that respect it has begun to encroach upon the iPad&#8217;s territory: over the weekend I watched episodes of both Downton Abbey and Homeland on my computer, something I would have never done on my old DELL. Although perhaps insignificant on the face of it, this use case marks a distinct change in the job I employ my computer to do, and is therefore one worth noting.</p>

<p>As for weight, my initial reaction upon pulling the Pro out of its box was that of surprise: it felt heavier than my old computer despite a greatly reduced form factor. Although a quick trip over to Apple&#8217;s website and an Amazon page that still, strangely, sells a near-identical version of my laptop five years past its prime proved my theory wrong, my perception of the Pro as a heavier device persisted likely due to its solid and dense build. Not that half a pound made much of a difference, though: every time I read an article proclaiming the significance of an x-gram delta between two devices or listen to a certain popular podcast host complain about the iPad Air&#8217;s weight versus the ever-so-light iPad Mini, I can&#8217;t help but find humor in the pedantry of it all. Spend five minutes in a gym with a dumbbell whose gradations come in 5-pound increments&#160;&#8212;&#160;2267.96 grams, for those keeping track&#160;&#8212;&#160;and then come back and complain about the 137 gram difference between the Mini and the Air. In fact, go to your cupboard and pick out seven slices of bread; that&#8217;s roughly the weight difference we&#8217;re talking about here. But I digress.</p>

<p>At this point in my article I would be remiss to gloss over this glaring, high-resolution elephant in the room: the Pro&#8217;s retina display. My notes for this section simply read &#8220;Beautiful retina display&#8221;, but while I would be foolish to argue the value of such an attractive screen&#160;&#8212;&#160;because I do love how it makes everything so much crisper&#160;&#8212;&#160;the more I tried to write something along those lines the more I came to realize that I cannot, in good conscience, hold this feature up as the greatest thing since those slices of bread you held earlier. While I certainly appreciate greater clarity, and the display makes a number of my favorite websites look especially clear and polished, unlike phenomenal battery life 220 pixels per inch is not a spec I consciously make note of every single time I open my computer; I do, however, notice its effects every time I open the lid.</p>

<p>Over the years I have moved from a gigantic 17&#8220; laptop to a much more reasonable 15.6&#8221; in my latest computer, where I imagined I would stay as a good compromise between vast screen real estate and portability. Capable of housing similar components, the ability to coherently and effectively display a greater volume of content has remained the primary draw of a larger form factor versus a more portable, smaller one. With the advent of the retina display, however, physical dimension ceased to be the only way to increase available screen space. Herein lies the greatest advantage of this technology: rather than merely a way to make the internet look almost universally terrible, utilizing high resolutions in service of enabling small screens to display great amounts of information clearly obviates the need for larger displays. Some use cases will undoubtedly still require 15&#8220; or even 17&#8221; form factors, but the more I use my 15" Retina MacBook Pro the more I become convinced that mine no longer does.</p>

<p>Facilitating much of the multi-touch interactivity Apple&#8217;s iOS devices have pioneered and then become famous for over the years, the MacBook&#8217;s trackpad combines much of Apple&#8217;s touch and desktop computing paradigms to interesting effect. A huge fan of the iPad&#8217;s gestures myself, I was quite happy to find many similarities between the MacBook&#8217;s gestures and that of its iOS counterparts. Of the entire machine, this trackpad has proved both one of the most useful tools and the most confounding.</p>

<p>Back in my days as a die-hard PC fanboy&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I say that with no hyperbole, for I epitomized the derogatory aspects of the term&#160;&#8212;&#160;I used a mouse constantly; wherever I had my laptop, I also had my mouse. I did not go so far as some of my friends, who bought mice with tens of buttons in addition to the traditional left, right, and scroll wheel, but I avoided the trackpad like a plague. I found it especially interesting, then, to discover that after just a day or two with Apple&#8217;s implementation of the tried and true trackpad, I preferred it over my old squeeze for every task save gaming. I also found this interesting when considered as the continuation of a trend towards centralization of resources. A vague phrase to be sure, let me elaborate:</p>

<p>At some point a year or so ago, I reached peak accessorization in my setup: atop my desk I had the central hub&#160;&#8212;&#160;my laptop&#160;&#8212;&#160;attached to a CyberPower seven port USB extender, to which I kept an external hard drive and at least one USB flash drive connected at all times, along with my iPod and iPad. For science. I had attached so many devices, in fact, that I had to power the extender independently. On the other side, I had a Westinghouse ~18" external monitor and a Logitech mouse, plus an array of knick-knacks. In various states of disarray, I also kept two sets of headphones available at all times, with an optional third in a drawer close by. Who knew when I might need a microphone or if I would tire of my go-to in-ear Apple earbuds? I sure didn&#8217;t. Obviously. Then one day I did an about-face and began gradually moving in the opposite direction: the USB extender went first, followed closely by the external hard drives and my extra monitor. An iPhone replaced my iPod, and my iPad still resides off to the side, but those two devices and my mouse are the last vestiges of a dark and cluttered time. As I began using my MacBook Pro increasingly often, I took one step further in that direction by removing my mouse from the equation for all but a few specific tasks.</p>

<p>I only mention this because John Siracusa did so on episode thirty-seven of ATP, <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/37-a-3000-word-digression"><em>A 30,000 Word Digression</em></a>, where he briefly took the Mac OS to task for its unintuitive approach to installing third-party applications. No surprise given that Apple obviously prefers users to install software through its Mac App Store, the process is nevertheless very un-Apple like. Whereas Windows simply requires users to obtain an installer and navigate disgusting offers to install some scourge of a toolbar and change your homepage to a porn site before running new applications, OS X makes its users download a DMG, mount the disk image, and remember to move the application from the mounted disk to your Applications folder before launch. Forgetting that, suppose someone launched an application directly from the DMG and unmounted it later only to find that next time he or she tried to open Sublime Text, the application did not exist. I did this twice before realizing that I needed to change the application&#8217;s location. And although some apps include links to the Applications directory and a readme, few&#160;&#8212;&#160;including Apple&#160;&#8212;&#160;make the requisite steps obvious. As if to further complicate the issue users will also occasionally encounter unsigned apps, for which OS X provides no apparent alternative to abandonment unless you happen to remember the right-click-to-open workaround. Again, granted given the push for developers to adopt the Mac App Store over the last two years Apple has almost no incentive to improve this experience, but at the same time this is a process many users will likely undertake during their tenure as a Mac user, and a poor one at that. To paraphrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Apple_Inc.#Microsoft_deal">Steve Jobs&#8217; famous line</a>, we must let go of this notion that for the Mac App Store to win, third-party apps must lose, and instead focus on improving the platform as a whole.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the app installation process is not the only source of friction in an operating system that has gained widespread renown for its polish. On a far more pedantic note, a small bug in Mission Control continues to annoy me: every time I perform a four finger upwards swipe to access this view, I place my mouse where I know the application I wish to launch will appear in an effort at opening it as quickly as possible. And every time I perform this gesture, my efforts are stymied when my clicks yield no results until I move the cursor, at which point the OS selects my desired app and allows me to click it. Until that time, however, I am left tapping my trackpad, <em>like an animal.</em></p>

<p>In an effort to stay my fall into <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nitpickery">nitpickery</a> I will conclude on that note. If I have failed to make it obvious thus far, on the whole I love my new computer: not only is it extremely fast and powerful, it is also light, portable, and has an excellent battery. That&#8217;s to say nothing for Mavericks which, despite my concluding criticisms, I have grown to like over the past few days. All in all I am very satisfied with this purchase, computer, operating system, and all. Well done, Apple: you have made me a convert.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Four hours being the optimistic number achievable only through restricting web browsing to the occasional foray and sticking mostly to a text editor at all other times. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that my old laptop managed to hold that charge throughout the course of its life: I can still get nearly the same battery life today as I could five years ago just after I bought it.</p>

<p>I hesitate to pass judgement just yet, but after the first I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m all too hopeful for a sequel. Taking a more adult approach in production will certainly help, but then again the first film didn&#8217;t exactly set a high bar.</p>

<p>In my last article, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-ipad-pro.html"><em>The iPad Pro</em></a>, I promised to write about Apple&#8217;s perpetuation of its second-generation tablet. I actually set out to discuss both the iPad 2 and a hypothetical Pro model in that piece, but long-windedness got the better of me and I had to push it off until now. Given that these points have already been made in parts elsewhere, I will keep this brief.</p>

<p>As the guys over at ATP explained in <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/36-a-weird-one">their latest episode</a>, now entering its fourth year of production Apple must make insane margins on the iPad 2&#160;&#8212;&#160;somewhere in the ballpark of 70<code>, they guessed. Contrast that with the <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/where-is-the-bad-news/">45</code> margin</a> Apple traditionally sees on its products and you begin to get a feel for how impressive that is at a $399 price point. Analysts praise Apple&#8217;s brilliance in employing a similar strategy with respect to its iPhone line by keeping previous models around, thereby taking advantage of economies of scale, decreased production costs each year as materials become cheaper, and lengthening the amount of time before Apple must retool its entire supply chain. Typically it takes Apple&#8217;s phones three years to run this gamut; the iPad 2 has ran it for three years now, and shows no signs of stopping.</p>

<p>After all, as Tim Cook said when asked at last Tuesday&#8217;s iPad event: there still exists a market for the iPad 2. Although cursory research yielded nothing substantive, anecdotal and second-hand evidence indicates that this market consists of educational institutions&#160;&#8212;&#160;buying them in <em>droves</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;and parents looking to give their young children a tablet.</p>

<p>Furthermore, not as if this would play a significant role in Apple&#8217;s decision though, continuing to manufacture the iPad 2 does not place any added constraints upon developers given that it imposes the same technical restrictions supporting the only recently-outdated first-generation iPad Mini does. Both devices have the same components, after all. As long as the Mini remains for sale, which could be for another two years at the long end of its potential lifecycle, and so long as schools and parents don&#8217;t demand too much from this device, I see no reason for Apple to discontinue this the iPad 2. They have a good thing going here; why stop now?</p>

<p>Shortly after Apple&#8217;s keynote earlier this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/apollozac/status/392726531560443904">Zac Hall made an interesting and thought-provoking quip</a> on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad ___.</p>
<p>Fill in the blank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, as I scrolled through my RSS reader catching up on pre- and post-event news, I came across <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/22/4865110/apple-ipad-air-hands-on">another interesting observationn</a> along the same lines, this time from The Verge&#8217;s David Pierce:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Where we&#8217;re perhaps most confused about the [iPad] Air is its naming. There was a palpable tension in the room in San Francisco when the name change was revealed, as if an iPad Pro were imminent&#160;&#8212;&#160;and though Tim Cook and others spent time bashing the strategies of Microsoft and Apple&#8217;s other competitors, it seems like a natural progression from the current lineup. Also confusing is the fact that the iPad 2 remains on sale for $399, despite woefully outdated hardware. Apple&#8217;s known for knocking $100 off the price of its current model as it introduces the next one, but it changed the strategy significantly here. And when the 7.9-inch iPad mini comes with incredibly similar internals for $100 less, how does Apple differentiate its two products other than simply screen size?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Set aside Apple&#8217;s perpetuation of the iPad 2 for a moment, for a will discuss that topic in a future article, and instead focus on the idea of an iPad Pro. As soon as Phil Schiller revealed the iPad<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Air, my mind immediately made the logical jump to an impending iPad Pro. It only made sense, after all, that Apple would address two very different use-cases with its tablets in the same manner it did by offering both a MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Even thousands of miles away, I felt the same tension David described above as I waited for Phil Schiller to expand the iPad line. Alas, it was not to be: he moved on first to the iPad Mini, then handed the stage back to Tim Cook who closed the event. Apple had no iPad Pro to unveil, nothing to fill the gaping hole it had just dug in its tablet line.</p>

<p>Leading up to the event <a href="http://pxlnv.com/blog/spitballing-apples-october-event/">many suspected</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nick-heers-predictions-for-apples-october-event.html">I hoped</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;that Apple would release an iPad 5 featuring both Touch ID and a new A7X processor<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Some also speculated that Apple would release a larger iPad, but few placed much stock in those rumors. Apple had no need for such a device, after all; its portfolio left as much room in the iPad line for a larger version as the MacBook line left for a 17&#8220; laptop. Eager for the considerable performance boost an A7X would provide over the 3&#8217;s A5X, I even considered purchasing a new iPad in addition to my preexisting plan to buy an updated MacBook Pro. More than simply an additional excuse to blow $599 though, I hoped Apple would also use this opportunity to reaffirm the iPad 5&#8217;s position above its smaller sibling by virtue of superior components. Especially given all the hype surrounding the iPad Mini, some part of me hoped to see Apple&#8217;s full-size tablet regain its rightful position atop the value pyramid. Unfortunately, Apple had other plans: instead of solidifying the iPad 5 as its premiere tablet offering, it shipped both the Mini and a new, rebranded version of its 9.7&#8221; iPad, the iPad Air, with almost indistinguishable components. Identical except for form factor and price, Apple removed any other traits that could have served as differentiating factors between the two devices.</p>

<p>Whereas retaining the iPad 4&#8217;s screen resolution made sense, as did moving to retina in the Mini, Apple&#8217;s refusal to differentiate its tablets by processing power confused me. Although I went in to the event with nothing more than unsubstantiated hope for the future of Apple&#8217;s iPad, if pressed I would have hedged my bets in predicting that Apple adopt a similar strategy with regards to its tablets as governs its laptop line. Just as consumers hire MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros to do very different jobs, so, too, did I think Apple would position its Mini and full-size iPads: the Mini as an ultra-portable device trading raw power for portability and extreme battery life, and the iPad 5 as a slightly larger, more powerful tablet geared towards creators necessitating greater horsepower in such a form factor. Shipping the Mini with an A7 processor and retina display, however, and the new iPad Air with near-identical technical specifications, flew directly in the face of that idea. Given Apple&#8217;s impressive track record of using its full-size iPad to push the boundaries of what it could feasibly offer consumers in such a device<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, this move took me by surprise. Rather than indicative of a shift in focus from the 9.7&#8220; iPad to its lauded 7.9&#8221; counterpart though, Apple&#8217;s decision not to continue pushing those boundaries instead served to create an opening for an iPad Pro and indicate the direction Apple plans to take such a device in the future.</p>

<p>In a race you can either work extremely hard to gradually move forward, or slam on the brakes until everyone has nearly lapped you before speeding up again. Either way you will have secured a spot in front, even if dishonorably in the latter case. Apple had a similar choice to make when setting a timeline for the iPad Pro&#8217;s internals. By unveiling new A6 and A6X <a href="http://bit.ly/AppleSOCWikipedia">SoCs</a> in such close proximity last year, Apple started what many considered the beginning of a trend by which new An and AnX chips shipped alongside the latest iPhones and iPads, respectively, in a strict yearly cycle rather than alternating each year as had previously gave rise to its A5 in March of 2011 and then A5X chipsets twelve months later. Although based on only one data point, the Mini&#8217;s debut with a second-generation A5 indicated that it would operate on the same cycle as the iPhones, thus spreading Apple&#8217;s two chips between three devices<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. In order to both increase performance throughout its existing roster year over year and simultaneously facilitate the advent of a pro-level tablet presumably in possession of greater processing power than Apple&#8217;s other, similar offerings, Tim Cook had no choice but to expand the number of available chipsets. Far easier said than done, Apple had two ways of accomplishing this: either by drastically pushing its development schedule forward, thereby enabling them to unveil the A7, A7X, A8, and A8X all at once, or by holding the latest generation of its current chipset from use; both would have the end result of increasing the number of chipsets available for a future release featuring the iPad Pro. Rather than the former, which would have proved much more difficult to accomplish, Apple instead opted for the latter course of action; next fall, alongside the A8 and A8X history tells us to expect, Apple will also have an unreleased A7X to utilize in some fashion. If I had to guess, I would say the Mini will ship with the A7X, the Air with the A8, and the Pro with the A8X.</p>

<p>There are, certainly, some problems with this strategy, perhaps most obvious of which could prove the perception of Apple&#8217;s Mini as recipient of outdated components. Although still an upgrade from its current A7, Apple shipping the Mini with an A7X next fall when the Air comes standard with an A8 and the iPad Pro with a new A8X could adversely effect sales if consumers do not take kindly to this shift. Especially given recent positioning of the Mini and Air as equal implied by their employment of similar chipsets due to almost identical hardware requirements, turning around and giving the Air a superior SoC next year could send a confusing message. Assuming Apple only released its Air equipped with the traditionally iPhone-bound An series to stay its hand in preparation for an iPad Pro launch though, confusing message or not Apple will have no problem spinning the Air&#8217;s jump from A7 to A8 as unequivocally positive.</p>

<p>Regardless of which system-on-a-chip Apple unveils the next generation of iPads with though, its move to employ the An family in a line traditionally necessitating high-performance AnX variants caught me by surprise. With the A7, Apple showed a huge vote of confidence in considering the chip capable of powering not only its iPhones, but its iPad line as well. Given that the A7 could drive both iPad Minis and Airs though, I have to wonder why Apple did not ship an iPad Pro sporting the A7X. If history tells us anything Apple had already created the chip, so why not put it to good use in the upcoming holiday buying season? Unfortunately, I have no good answer.</p>

<p>If Apple wanted to differentiate its tablets on more than processing speed and, potentially, form factor in producing a physically larger iPad Pro through the inclusion Touch ID, for example, supply constraints could have played a major role in keeping a pro-level offering from market. Some have attributed a lack of Touch ID in the Mini and Air models to such a cause, which I consider plausible. However, I find Touch ID functioning as a feature with which to segment Apple&#8217;s tablets unlikely: although tempting, I have a hard time believing Apple would predicate a device&#8217;s security on price tier. When Touch ID finally does make it to the iPads, it will come to every model.</p>

<p>Sadly, unless Apple holds a very special event sometime in the very near future, we will have no choice but to wait a whole year for an iPad Pro or even Touch ID integration, for that matter. WWDC 2014 could hold some clues, but neither creating a new product segment or incorporating Touch ID qualify as minor, incremental updates we will likely to see before a dedicated iPad event next October in 2014.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;&#8220;The iPad&#8221;? Just &#8220;iPad&#8221;? I only noticed this after going back to re-watch Phil Schiller announce the iPad Air: none of Apple&#8217;s executives place an article before their tablets, nor do any of their marketing materials. Perhaps this, like Apple&#8217;s insistence on a lowercase &#8220;S&#8221; despite functioning as an <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">initialism</a>, is another curious stylistic choice Apple made for obscure marketing reasons.</p>

<p id='fn2'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref2'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Interestingly, M7 integration went largely unreported. Either deemed a given or of too little importance with all the other devices and upgrades rumored to take place at the event, I cannot recall a single article spending any time discussing the M7 in any capacity, or what Apple might use it for in the larger iPads.</p>

<p id='fn3'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref3'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;For proof of this one need only look to the transition from iPad 2 to 3 where Apple began shipping its tablet with a retina display: although the iPad 3 brought with it increased computing power as had become traditional with each successive iPad generation, the move to retina effectively canceled out any performance advantages between the second and third generation given that the device now needed to drive four times as many pixels as its predecessor.</p>

<p>Although a very impressive technical feat, I have a hard time believing Steve Jobs was happy with this turn of events. Given the choice, I suspect he would have opted to ship the iPad 3 with the A6X&#160;&#8212;&#160;not to reach the market until six months later&#160;&#8212;&#160;rather than the A5X in order to achieve both retina resolution and increase device performance in a single move. However, given that this was the fist time Apple had two new processors available simultaneously&#160;&#8212;&#160;previously Apple&#8217;s processors released on a yearly cycle, whereas both the second-generation A5 and the A5X both shipped on the same day&#160;&#8212;&#160;such a feat proved technically unfeasible, and so Jobs accepted the trade-off as a necessary evil.</p>

<p id='fn4'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref4'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Incidentally, the Mini&#8217;s update to an A7 rather than A6X or A7X supports this theory. Complicating the issue, however, is the Air&#8217;s shipment with the A7 rather than the A7X, proving once again that no rule is set in stone.</p>

<p>Ever since reading Craig Hockenberry&#8217;s article <a href="http://furbo.org/2013/09/11/sonderklasse/"><em>Sonderklasse</em></a>, an article ostensibly about the iPhone 5S, I have waited for an opportunity to write about something I came across in the process of reading that piece: the Mercedes G63 AMG.</p>

<p>Just when you thought it couldn&#8217;t get any cooler, the latest addition to Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s elite G-class, the G63, is a departure from the traditional box-like SUV form factor characteristic of the line. A six-by-six monster with a cab for four and a truck bed on back, the G63 is both massive and, equipped with a 536-horsepower engine, quite the formidable machine. Unfortunately, as Jacob Brown of Automotive.com points out in <a href="http://blogs.automotive.com/mercedes-benz-g63-amg-6x6-going-on-sale-for-more-than-500000-151181.html">the successor to</a> his introductory article aptly titled <a href="http://blogs.automotive.com/mother-of-god-mercedes-benz-unleashes-g63-amg-6x6-on-the-world-video-129601.html"><em>Mother of God! Mercedes-Benz Unleashes G63 AMG 6x6 on the World</em></a>, the G63 will not be available in the United States. As if that were the only problem I would have faced in acquiring one, at $510,000 a pop.</p>

<p>If you, like me, simply cannot get enough of this vehicle, here&#8217;s a list of articles I found interesting, insightful, and all-around great complete with details, observations, and galleries:</p>

</ul>

<p>Far from the only vehicle I intend to cover in this piece, Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s latest G-class is just the first of three. As I drove down the freeway the other day, I came up behind an interesting truck I found very reminiscent of the G63: the Hummer H3T. Already out in the wild though, I leave searching for pictures and reviews to you.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps even more impressive in some regards than Mercedes&#8217; G63, the Romanian company Ghe-O Motors has created a beast of a vehicle in the <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/10/ghe-o-rescue/">Rescue</a>. Weighing in at 3.2 tons and equipped with a 500 horsepower engine versus the G63 which weighs in at approximately four and a half tons with a 536 horsepower engine, the Rescue puts this extra power and weight savings to good use in its ability to climb and drive across nearly any surface, including water. The only thing the Rescue cannot do (yet) is fly. Wired calls Ghe-O&#8217;s Rescue a cross between the original Hummer and Batman&#8217;s Tumbler (Tumblr?), and I couldn&#8217;t think of a better way to put it.</p>

<p>With the exception of the H3T, these are not cars everyday people own. In reality, they are more like superhero vehicles than anything else.</p>

<p>Last week Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/open-source-apps/"><em>Open Source Apps</em></a>, where he explained the &#8220;inevitable&#8221; shift from paid-up-front to free apps monetized through other means. From his article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit late to the most recent flareup around app store pricing - it&#8217;s been a busy week of traveling - but it&#8217;s worth noting that the trend towards free is basically inevitable and the expected result in a functioning market. To put it another way, apps want to be free just like apples want to fall to the ground - it&#8217;s natural and takes truly impressive efforts to work against the gravitational pull.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I unfortunately have no evidence with which to argue the widespread notion that the paid app market is dying, I still take great issue with those who present the impending shift to a free and free with in-app purchase model as beneficial, the natural progression of healthy markets, or both. Rather than continuing to operate under the sustainable, paid model Apple&#8217;s App Store currently functions in, recent months have seen that model begin to undergo a disappointing process of reverse-evolution in devolving towards the models employed by marketplaces in their infancy, such as Google&#8217;s Play Store and, although I cannot speak from direct experience, anecdotal evidence would indicate Amazon&#8217;s Appstore as well.</p>

<p>A young space relative to Apple&#8217;s established one, the vast majority of apps on the Play Store are free and, famously, of extremely dubious quality and value. Although I could devote an entire article to the discussion of whether a nonexistent price point begets a lack of quality or if a lack of quality begets a nonexistent price point, the root cause does not change the end result: as the proliferation of low-quality entrants chip away at any faith Android&#8217;s users have in the store to provide quality apps in exchange for a nominal fee, an increasingly small subset of developers will achieve any meaningful success focusing on this platform. Nevertheless Android has continued to entice developers, due in large part to its vast user base and continued platform growth. It is worth noting, however, that the only reason Android and, by extension, its app market has sustained growth up to this point is not due to any inherent superiority, but because more people enter the ecosystem each quarter than lose faith in it. This will change both dramatically and abruptly once the smartphone market reaches saturation and Android&#8217;s growth ceases though, which Horace Dediu <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/07/when-will-the-us-reach-smartphone-saturation/">predicts will occur between 2015 and 2020 in the U.S.</a> and <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/16/when-will-the-european-union-five-reach-smartphone-saturation/">a similar time frame for the European Union</a>. For those developers who threw their hat in with Android, this adage will prove painfully applicable: you lose your fortune in two ways: gradually, and then suddenly. So, too, will Android&#8217;s marketplace begin to lose users after the platform reaches saturation: slowly, and then very, very quickly.</p>

<p>As a brief and hopefully succinct aside, the same could be said for not only its app marketplace, but the Android platform as a whole as well. Although I did find some potentially useful figures detailing <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/22/apples_iphone_has_89_retention_rate_next_nearest_hardware_is_htc_at_39">both Apple and Android&#8217;s retention rates</a>, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/03/11/where-are-the-android-users/">Android&#8217;s growth rate</a>, and <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2010/08/12/the-iphone-growth-rate/">the iPhone&#8217;s growth rate</a>, I am not Horace Dediu; making sense of those numbers, percentages, and trends in service of the point I intended to make on a whim would prove much more difficult than I have both time and energy for at the moment. Therefore, I picked arbitrary numbers to illustrate this point: suppose Android loses 5<code> of its existing user base each quarter. Over the same period, however, that same user base grows by 20</code> due to new user adoption; thus, it experiences a net gain of 15<code>. Setting aside the complexities of a decreased growth rate Horace illustrated in his graphs as the smartphone market approaches saturation, at some point Android&#8217;s quarterly growth will decrease from 20</code> to 0. However, it will likely continue to lose that 5% steadily.</p>

<p>Unlikely to move back down market to an antiquated flip phone or purchase another Android phone&#160;&#8212;&#160;see the aforementioned retention rates for more on this&#160;&#8212;&#160;the logical third option for Android users dissatisfied with the platform is to move upmarket. Specifically, to purchase an iPhone. All hyperbole aside, the general populace considers the iPhone the gold standard. Right or wrong, this is the reality of the industry we live in today. Given its phenomenal retention rate, the iPhone would likely be their last stop. Although one could paint a similarly dystopian picture in regards to the iPhone&#8217;s future, a stronger retention rate combined with its position as the industry&#8217;s highest-end offering make both steady user loss and a downgrade back to Android infeasible for the same reasons the dissatisfied Android customer would not go back to a flip phone.</p>

<p>With that aside out of the way, back to app stores. Before embarking on that tangent, I had outlined many of the issues Android&#8217;s app market faces. Namely, unsustainable pricing; unstable growth; and undefined identity, by which I mean whereas Apple&#8217;s App Store fostered a reputation for apps of the highest quality, the Play Store has not only failed to do that but also has yet to develop any sort of reputable status quo. These are not characteristics of a developed and mature store, yet it is the direction we seem to be marching with grim solidarity. To say that this transition, then, that this farcical goal we are slowly moving towards is in any way beneficial boggles my mind. Further, as evidenced by Android&#8217;s eventual implosion, the free(mium) model is not only the wrong goal to strive for, but a fatally unsustainable one as well.</p>

<p>Buckle up, folks; you&#8217;re almost done.</p>

<p>Like all of its products, Apple designed the App Store and its associated business model in an incredibly opinionated manner. Clearly a result of the company&#8217;s overarching design philosophy, even Apple&#8217;s detractors cannot argue against the App Store&#8217;s phenomenal success, nor could they make a valid case refuting the exceptional quality present in most of its offerings. Apple built its entire mobile platform atop a reputation for excellence, after all, and that prestige continues to serve as a key reason many continue embracing Apple&#8217;s ecosystem. Rather than the natural progression of healthy markets then, as Ben Thompson portrays this devolution towards the largely unsuccessful models Google and Amazon implemented in their respective stores, this shift is instead wholly the product of shoddy entrants diluting app categories and eroding the App Store&#8217;s overall quality. By no means a new phenomenon, crude apps have always held the potential to devalue Apple&#8217;s platform; in fact, since day one they have. Until now though, exceptional quality and polish put forth by hallmarks of the ecosystem have collectively slowed and masked this glacial depreciation of value. Recent weeks, however, have finally seen those adverse effects become widely perceptible as the number of mediocre apps began to outpace the cumulative merits of the App Store&#8217;s elites. Unfortunately, it will take truly momentous efforts to right the scales: not only will developers need to perpetuate the high status-quo of quality, they must simultaneously raise that bar to counteract the current state of Apple&#8217;s App Store in order to assure its longevity as a viable platform in the future.</p>

<p>Sadly, I have my doubts. I fear we may have already moved too far in the wrong direction to do an about-face, much less regain lost ground. Talk about a sign of the times when Marco Arment, famously opinionated especially when it came to the creation and marketing of his apps and services, <a href="http://nextmarket.co/blogs/conversations/9635499-a-conversation-with-marco-arment">considers releasing his next app for free</a>. That does not, however, mean that all is lost. Even Ben Thompson alluded to some shred of hope as evidenced by his concluding line in the aforecited paragraph: &#8220;[it] takes truly impressive efforts to work against the gravitational pull.&#8221; Just as with significant effort one can overcome gravity&#8217;s overwhelming force, so, too, could developers beat back the seemingly irresistible pull towards a free app market with some old-fashioned hard work and a bit of elbow grease. For both their sake and for the continued growth of Apple&#8217;s app ecosystem, I sincerely hope they do.</p>

<p>Shawn Blanc on Nick Heer&#8217;s predictions for Apple&#8217;s event next week: &#8220;From my armchair, I say Nick is probably pretty close to the money here.&#8221; I really hope so: I have been holding out for a new MacBook Pro since before Apple unveiled the new Airs; it would be a huge disappointment if I had to continue waiting until January.</p>

<p>On the tablet front, I may also consider purchasing a new iPad along with a MacBook Pro and a new iPhone. Widely rumored to ship with Apple&#8217;s new Touch ID functionality, this upgrade in conjunction with the A7X processor Nick expects the iPad 5 to ship with might just be enough to entice me to buy a new one Especially coming from an iPad 3 with the A6X, the speed boost would be a welcome one.</p>

<p>Film School Rejects&#8217; Inkoo Kang has been posting fantastic reviews of each new Homeland episode shortly after their premiere. Now at three articles, one whole review for each of the three episodes out to date, I have been thoroughly enjoying her examination of the plot lines, undertones, direction, and parallels present in this show almost as much as I enjoy watching each episode.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t ever seen Homeland, or haven&#8217;t caught up to the latest season yet, I cannot emphasize this point strongly enough: do <em>not</em> read her reviews; it would be a disservice to both her and the show should you read them having not seen every single show preluding it, and without a firm grasp of the show&#8217;s plot and undertones. If you have followed the show religiously though since its debut, I can&#8217;t recommend Kang&#8217;s articles strongly enough.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen a great proliferation of linkblogs, by far and away the most popular topic of which is technology and, specifically, Apple. Nevertheless the likes of John Gruber&#160;&#8212;&#160;who did not, despite many erroneous beliefs, invent either the format or topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Shawn Blanc have made their mark as entrants to a space established long before their arrival. This not only happens in the blogging space, but the podcasting industry as well where interview shows like Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s <em>Bitsplitting</em> came in and <em>sherlocked</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;ugh&#160;&#8212;&#160;the existing space, which already had <em>plenty</em> of interview programs, with a really great show.</p>

<p>Over the past three weeks much has been said about the podcasting industry. <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/09/because-podcasts-awesome/">Stephen Hacket</a>, <a href="http://unretrofied.com/blog/2013/9/26/ios-7-and-the-state-of-podcast-apps">Chris Gonzales</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/ios-7-and-podcast-apps/">Federico Viticci</a>, and <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/10/hurley-podcasting/">Myke Hurley</a> all wrote articles on this topic, but that didn&#8217;t change the fact that I had something to say, and so I contributed <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html">my two-cents as well</a>. On one level I sherlocked<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> all those other posts, and it worked fine: many loved my article, much to my delight, because I had something interesting and unique to say. Similarly, so many loved <em>Bitsplitting</em> because Daniel Jalkut took a different approach to the tried-and-true interview show format; he, too, had something interesting and unique to contribute to the overarching narrative.</p>

<p>Need I continue?</p>

<p>Just because an app has cornered a particular market niche, or because that market is saturated, is by no means a valid excuse not to enter it. If we applied that logic outside the realm of apps, no one would ever write anything; no new podcasts would hit the market; no one would create another blog. But that&#8217;s oversimplifying the problem, as Marco said in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/08/sherlocking-myself"><em>Sherlocking Myself Just Fine Over Here</em></a>: everyone brings their own nuance to bear in creation. All Apple blogs are not the same; no two to-do list apps are the same. Whether through a hundred minute design decisions or the phrasing of a paragraph, every creative product is unique in some way. The challenge, then, should not be whether to enter a market or not, but how your entrant will differentiate itself from the incumbents.</p>

<p>The question of whether Clark Kent as Superman should or should not kill is an extremely interesting one, and one I have spent quite a bit of time thinking about since seeing <em>Man of Steel</em> a few weeks ago. For the uninitiated, the controversy sprang up when Superman killed General Zod to save a family after destroying the whole of Metropolis throughout the course of their battle.</p>

<p>On September 24th, David Goyer wrote <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/david-goyer-defends-decision-to-let-superman-kill-says-man-of-steel-is-basically-superman-begins-20130924">an article defending his decision to let Superman kill in <em>Man of Steel</em></a>"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We wanted him to have had that experience of having taken a life and carry that through onto the next films.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they portray Batman as the same character in the past Christopher Nolan films, which I sincerely hope they do, I could foresee some friction between Batman and Superman over this event. Batman is, for better or worse, highly idealistic after all, and would almost certainly look down on Superman for killing Zod. Batman refused to kill the Joker, after all. This could make for an interesting dynamic as the very human Batman looks down on the god-like Superman for making a very human choice.</p>

<p>Interesting dynamic or not though, this hypothetical does not answer the question of whether Superman made the right choice in killing Zod<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In order to answer this, I believe we must clearly define both who and what Superman is. Rob Bricken of io9 in <a href="http://io9.com/why-letting-superman-kill-kills- superman-1440140313"><em>Why Letting Superman Kill Kills Superman</em></a> did this very well, albeit in the process of making the opposite point I intend to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Superman is especially the character that is supposed to inspire us to aspire to something greater. That&#8217;s his whole damn point. He is supposed to represent humanity at its best. He&#8217;s supposed make the right decision even when they doesn&#8217;t seem to be one. When faced with two impossible choices  like, say, killing Zod or letting an innocent family die  he&#8217;s supposed to somehow figure out a third option, so he wins without compromising his principles. That&#8217;s his greatest superpower  to always do the right thing.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with Rob: Superman should make the right decision even when it seems impossible; he should always find that third option so he wins without compromising both his principles and our faith in him. I do not, however, think that any of those qualities necessary rule out the ultimate penalty though: just like in <em>The Legend of Korra</em>, which I wrote about in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeons-experiment.html"><em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em></a>, where the creators went out of their way to avoid even the implication of death, they did not completely rule the possibility out. From my aforementioned article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the complex subjects of war, classism, and civil unrest, the writers of the Avatar series also dealt with a number of other controversial topics in a novel way, including death: rather than something to avoid at all costs, it became a key plot element. Death&#8217;s general absence from the series made the few episodes in which it did appear remarkably impactful, especially in <em>The Legend of Korra</em>. After Tarlock used false charges to imprison Avatar Korra&#8217;s friends, she demanded their release; he refused, and a particularly fierce battle broke out in which Korra quickly gained the upper hand. In order to save himself, Tarlock revealed his ability to bloodbend in a desperate last-ditch maneuver to stay Korra&#8217;s deadly onslaught. Implicitly emphasized in this scene, Tarlock&#8217;s brief brush with death proved his last. Later in the series, after Korra revealed Amon&#8217;s true identity as a waterbender, he lost all support from the Equalist party. With no other options left, Amon freed his brother Tarlock and the pair made their escape on a speed boat. Feeling great remorse over both his and his brother&#8217;s actions though, Tarlock used one of Amon&#8217;s own weapons to ignite the boat&#8217;s gas tanks in a stunning murder-suicide off the coast of Republic City. The one and only barefaced encounter with death in the entire season, this was one of the strongest scenes in The Legend of Korra and possibly the entire Avatar series.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as <em>The Legend of Korra</em>&#8216;s creators used the almost comical avoidance of death as an extremely effective plot intensifier, so too did <em>Man of Steel</em>&#8217;s creators with violence: all throughout the movie Clark either refused to use his powers or his parents forbade him from using them. Sometimes for good reason, but at other times I couldn&#8217;t help but wish he would knock that drunk guy from the bar through a wall. Irregardless of the motivations behind his aversion to violence though, the movie pushed this theme for an inordinately long amount of time&#160;&#8212;&#160;much longer than justifiable for a minor plot element anyway, which brings me to go so far as to say it was the single focus of the movie, building up to a single, key moment: when General Zod threatened the lives of a small family. Clark had to make a choice then: the fundamental rules he had been brought up with, the ones that had been drilled into us over and over again throughout the movie, or this family&#8217;s lives. And he snapped: he just broke, and then he snapped Zod&#8217;s neck. It was easily the most impactful scene I have seen in a movie for quite some time.</p>

<p>Clark will not walk away from this emotionally unscathed. As I said earlier, I hope to see his execution of Zod come up in future movies. But as to the question of whether or not he was right in killing General Zod, I think that answer is the easiest of all: anything less would have been more of a betrayal of that faith Rob Bricken talks about in his article than actually killing Zod. Had Superman let Zod go, what would that have said about humanity, which Rob holds up as analogous to Superman? That we must hold on to our high-minded ideals no matter what? That nothing is worth killing for? Both of these statements are just as wrong as Clark letting Zod murder that family would have been.</p>

<p>A few days ago I watched a strange article from The Verge titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/7/4811508/lg-flexible-oled-mass-production-announcement"><em>LG starts producing curved displays to cure dull phone design</em></a> scroll by in my RSS reader, but paid it little attention. Then, last night, another item caught my eye: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4817564/samsung-curved-smartphone-leaked-image"><em>Is this Samsung&#8217;s curved smartphone?</em></a> Although still unconvinced as to the form factor&#8217;s upsides, I nevertheless opened the article. Shortly thereafter, to my delight, the last piece confirmed the rumor: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4818572/samsung-galaxy-round-curved-oled-smartphone-official"><em>Samsung announces the Galaxy Round, a smartphone with a curved OLED display</em></a>. From Sam Byford&#8217;s article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The potential benefit of this screen technology isn&#8217;t quite clear yet,...&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly the author has never <em>experienced</em> this device. The phrase, &#8220;Once you go Curve, you can never go back&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exist for nothing, after all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;...but Samsung is touting a new feature called &#8216;Round Interaction,&#8217; which allows you to look at information such as missed calls, battery life, and the date and time when you tilt it on a flat surface with the screen off....&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating. Not only can I check for missed calls, I can also roll my phone around the table to see battery life, the date, and time as well. Excellent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;...Samsung also claims that switching between home screens will feel like one continuous transition,...&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Samsung thankfully tackling the hard problems like a champ. At least someone in this space realizes the actual issues facing today&#8217;s smartphone consumers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;...and has worked on new tilt-based interactions for the music and photos apps.&#8221;</p>

<p>All things considered, if I had to choose a single word to describe this device I would say &#8220;unashamedly curved.&#8221;</p>

<p>I see great potential for the Galaxy Round in the market of people who must carry marbles great distances without touching them. Traditionally done with PVC pipes during teamwork activities at children&#8217;s camps, Samsung has brought its synergistic nature and creativity to bare in an unprecedented level by effectively destroying the sliced PVC for teamwork activities at children&#8217;s camps market with a single, stunning entrant. Some may criticize the device&#8217;s lack of four edges thereby greatly complicating the process of marble transportation, but at just $1013 I don&#8217;t see why anyone wouldn&#8217;t simply buy two. And to anyone complaining about the price, that&#8217;s just 1013 of those over-priced Apple apps, or about <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/387644371535134720">ten days playing a game with in-app purchases</a>.</p>

<p>The only downside I see to this phone is that, given its curvature, it will likely prove a sub-par doorstop. However, for those Apple fanboys who keep holding this minor design oversight up as indicative of Samsung&#8217;s pending doom, <em>turn the phone upside down.</em> Problem solved.</p>

<p>As a huge fan of the medium myself, over the last two weeks I have followed a burgeoning discussion on the podcasting industry with great interest. Across the board, the discourse has remained almost universally positive: <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/09/because-podcasts-awesome/">Stephen Hacket</a>, <a href="http://unretrofied.com/blog/2013/9/26/ios-7-and-the-state-of-podcast-apps">Chris Gonzales</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/ios-7-and-podcast-apps/">Federico Viticci</a>, and <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/10/hurley-podcasting/">Myke Hurley</a> have all expressed considerable enthusiasm for the changes iOS 7 in particular signals for this space, and great hope for its future. Unsurprisingly, not all share these positive sentiments.</p>

<p>A few days ago Myke Hurley, formerly of 70 Decibels and now a host at 5by5, made a guest post on 512 Pixels broadly titled <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/10/hurley-podcasting/"><em>What is Podcasting?</em></a>. Throughout the article Myke talked about his growth as a podcaster, the medium itself, and his thoughts on the direction this industry is headed. Although never explicitly stated, Myke also seemed to write in response to Harry Marks&#8217; <a href="http://curiousrat.com/the-state-of-podcasting-2013"><em>The State of Podcasting: 2013</em></a>. Unlike Myke and many others of late, Harry Marks spoke much more critically of the podcasting industry and offered a number of suggestions I&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Myke, I wager&#160;&#8212;&#160;strongly disagree with. Before I get to those differences though I would like to&#160;&#8212;&#160;in Harry Marks-fashion&#160;&#8212;&#160;briefly list the podcasts I currently listen to, for those who may be curious:</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Technology">Technology<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Technology">#</a></span></h3>

<li>Amplified</li>
<li>AsmyCAR</li>

<li>The Distraction</li>
<li>The Frequency</li>
<li>Kalzumeus Software</li>

<ul>
<li>Bitsplitting</li>
<li>Matterful.co</li>
<li>Roderick on the Line</li>
<li>Screen Time</li>
<li>5by5 at the Movies</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, some of those shows do not broadcast weekly: Horace Dediu and Jim Zellmer only record one episode of <em>AsymCAR</em> each month, and <em>The Crossover</em> has not seen a new episode since March of 2012. I nevertheless currently subscribe and actively listen to each and every one of those podcasts though; moreover, that list does not include any retired shows like <em>Hypercritical</em> or <em>You Look Nice Today</em>, which no longer air regularly or at all.</p>

<p>Like Harry Marks, once upon a time I listened to many more podcasts than I do even today: not too long ago I subscribed to every show on 5by5, along with a few other &#8220;indie&#8221; productions. Unlike Harry, however, who became bored and burned out with (tech) podcasts, I simply ran out of hours in the day and thus had no choice but to take a number of them out to the chopping block. In stark contrast to Harry&#8217;s reasons for cutting down on his audio consumption, many of those very reasons drew me to the medium.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="60MinutesorLess">"60 Minutes or Less"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#60MinutesorLess">#</a></span></h2>

<p>In his first suggestion for improving podcasts at large, Harry proposes adhering to a strict runtime of sixty minutes. Positing that any longer reflects poorly not only on the host but their guest and co-hosts as well, Harry pushes this time limit at the cost of both content and quality in his next section. Of the seven sections in his article, my disagreement with this philosophy is second to but one.</p>

<p>Back in the days of <em>Hypercritical</em>, nothing made me happier than downloading a new episode, hitting play, hearing John declare the beginning of a short show, and looking down at the scrubber to see two hours left. I understand the appeal of short episodes, but the format has its place and should not, in any way, pervade the podcasting industry as a whole. To use a more recent example, I could listen to Myke Hurley and Matt Alexander make innuendos and veiled sexual references for <em>hours</em>. A forty-eight or fifty-two minute episode just doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>

<p>Some shows do overstay their welcome, I will not deny that; many, however, and especially the great works of this day and age&#160;&#8212;&#160;think <em>Roderic on the Line</em>, <em>QUIT!</em>, and <em>Accidental Tech Podcast</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;understay that welcome, if anything. Never have I downloaded any of these podcasts&#8217;s latest episodes and dreaded a ninety minute runtime; usually, it makes my day.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="EditEditEdit">"Edit, Edit, Edit"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#EditEditEdit">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Perhaps the most controversial section in his article and easily the one I find most ridiculous, Harry Marks advocates editing for content in pursuit of that golden sixty minute runtime in &#8220;Edit, Edit, Edit&#8221;. I believe Myke put his issue with this philosophy best <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/10/hurley-podcasting/#fn:1">in a footnote to his aforementioned article</a>, <em>What is Podcasting</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Whilst we&#8217;re talking about editing, let me tell you my philosophy. I personally believe that heavy content editing is a bad thing. &#8216;We don&#8217;t edit for content,&#8217; Dan Benjamin says, and I&#8217;m a believer. It disrupts the natural flow of conversation and I shy away from it as much as possible. Let your podcast be a living and breathing thing. If it lasts 90 minutes, then so be it. There was a reason you recorded for that long, you just need to decide if that&#8217;s the show you want to do. If you want it to be thirty minutes, find a way to make your conversations that length. Don&#8217;t arbitrarily construct a 30 minute podcast from a 90 minute conversation. Don&#8217;t make your editing application a slaughterhouse.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, don&#8217;t make your editing application a slaughterhouse. Cutting out part of an interview in pursuit of an artificial time limit is absolutely ludicrous; who benefited from those subtractions? Surely not the listener, who had to settle for a portion rather than the full interview. How, then, could the producer have derived any benefit from removing even a small amount of content, justified with some asinine responsibility to stick with a self-imposed time restriction?</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="PickaLittleTalkaLittle">"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PickaLittleTalkaLittle">#</a></span></h2>

<p>From Harry&#8217;s article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A listener should never hear, &#8216;So, anything else we should talk about?&#8217; It&#8217;s insulting and shows a lack of forethought from the host(s). Topics for a show should be set in advance and, more importantly, should be discussed for an appropriate length of time before moving on to the next.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;So many shows ramble on with nary a care to the clock and the result is a podcast that comes off as sloppy and unprofessional. Having a casual conversation about a topic or idea is great and hosts/guests with great rapport are necessary for a show to thrive, but a good host knows when to move on and nudge everyone onto the next topic. A 45-minute rathole before you approach the first talking point is not a sign of quality.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Standing opposite the picture Harry Marks holds up as the ideal broadcast, John Roderick and Merlin Mann&#8217;s <em>Roderick on the Line</em> defies nearly every criteria Harry lies out for a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;professional&#8221; podcast. If you think John&#160;&#8212;&#160;or Merlin, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;ever prepared a list of topics ahead of time or discussed said topics &#8220;for an appropriate length of time before moving on to the next&#8221;, if you think this lack of stringent and traditional preparation makes <em>Roderick on the Line</em> sloppy or unprofessional, you have obviously never listened to an episode of this excellent program. Similarly, in <em>Back to Work</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;although to a slightly lesser degree&#160;&#8212;&#160;we find another great example of a show antithetical to Harry&#8217;s idealisms, yet wildly popular and inarguably excellent despite the invariable forty-five minutes of shucking and jiving Dan and Merlin famously engage in before approaching their first talking point.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="TistheSeason">"'Tis the Season"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TistheSeason">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Unlike the preceding sections, I found myself agreeing wholeheartedly with Harry Marks in this one. Merlin and Dan have often, albeit jokingly, referred to various episodes of <em>Back to Work</em> as &#8220;S1E7&#8221;, for example, and Daniel Jalkut has put his interview podcast <em>Bitsplitting</em> on hiatus with the intent of bringing it back for a second season sometime in the near future. With those minor exceptions, however, the podcasting industry has almost universally rejected the idea of splitting shows into seasons. Quite unfortunately, I might add: dividing a show into seasons would have a great number of benefits not only to the listener, but to the show&#8217;s producer as well.</p>

<p>In the past an inability to find and download a podcast&#8217;s first episodes has ultimately prevented me from listening to that show at all. To quote Myke once again, &#8220;I believe that podcasts are conversations; they have a natural flow to them. They have a start, a middle and an end. Any point that is made has been influenced and guided by everything said before it.&#8221; I feel that Myke did not only say this in reference to single episodes, but the entire run of a show as well: just as individual episodes have a start, middle, and end, so too do entire shows; and just as tampering with that natural flow disrupts and takes away from the listening experience, so too does jumping into a show halfway.</p>

<p>If I had skipped the first fifty episodes of <em>Roderick on the Line</em>, for example, I would not understand &#8220;ping-pong&#8221; and why it has spread outside of Merlin&#8217;s podcasts; had I not listened to every episode of <em>Hypercritical</em> I would not get the joke when, two years later, someone teases John Siracusa about a toaster; if I had come late to the party and never listened to <em>You Look Nice Today</em>, I would have missed out on a huge part of internet culture; in an alternate universe where I did not go back and listen to <em>Bionic</em> from the beginning, I wouldn&#8217;t understand Myke&#8217;s feigned dismay at what the show has turned in to.</p>

<p>I would have missed out on all these things had I deigned not to invest extra time into listening to the back catalog before picking the show up on its most recent episodes; unfortunately, as time passes and more episodes come out, the likelihood of anyone following the same course of action decreases significantly mainly because most podcast producers arbitrarily cap their RSS feeds to the most recent thirty to fifty episodes and thus lock out anyone wishing to download and listen to the first installments of a promising, just-discovered podcast. While making every episode in existence available via RSS would help alleviate this problem, putting four hundred and twenty-five episodes of <em>This Week in Tech</em> in Instacast is neither an elegant solution, nor the best by any measure. Instead, one possible solution could see podcast producers release their shows in seasons of twelve, twenty-five, or fifty episodes, with each season distributed as its own, standalone podcast. In addition to solving the problem of timeframe availability, wherein certain episodes are only available for a narrow window of time before newer episodes push them out of the feed, this model would also allow hosts to shift gears into other topics much more easily than is possible today.</p>

<p>Marco Arment, John Siracusa, and Casey Liss&#8217;s casual car podcast <em>Neutral</em> got so much attention not only because it had so many big names in the tech community attached to it, but also because all throughout <em>Hypercritical</em> and <em>Build &#38; Analyze</em> listeners fantasized about John and Marco discussing other topics outside of technology. With the advent of <em>Neutral</em>, those masses suddenly found a venue where not only John and Marco talked about a topic traditionally of great interest to the same audience <em>Hypercritical</em> and <em>Build &#38; Analyze</em> appealed to, but a podcast on which they discussed this subject together. In other words, perhaps just as important as the topic Marco, John, and Casey chose, the roster played an almost equal role in the show&#8217;s success. Whereas this shift in topic required the creation of an entirely new podcast, a seasonal model could conceivably obviate that need by allowing hosts to choose entirely different topics for each season.</p>

<p>Horace Dediu&#8217;s podcast <em>AsymCAR</em> is a prime example of a situation in which this seasonal model could have been implemented to great success: with the automobile industry a recurring topic on his podcast <em>The Critical Path</em>, Horace started <em>AsymCAR</em> as a means to pursue the subject in greater depth. At four episodes as of this writing <em>AsymCAR</em> could have easily functioned as a spinoff series rather than its own entity and benefited from <em>The Critical Path</em>&#8217;s existing listenership, and gained greater exposure because of it.</p>

<p>Of course, this approach does present a number of problems: frequently changing topics does not lend itself to a stable and loyal listenership. Just as the importance of maintaining a consistent release schedule cannot be understated in fostering a loyal and engaged following, so too is maintaining a consistent thread throughout the life of the show. There are, as in any field, exceptions: take <em>Bionic</em>, for example: a show that once focused on the &#8220;analysis of competing technological and media ecosystems&#8221;, is has evolved into a hilarious dialogue with a dash of tech thrown in for flavor. By and large though, a topic of interest to one person could hold none for another and vice-versa, and a seasonal podcasting model in which the topic of focus changed each season would greatly complicate the challenge of identifying and occupying a specific market segment.</p>

<p>As with any rule, there are exceptions: if tomorrow Marco decided to start a home improvement podcast, I would give it a try; if John started an art podcast, despite having no interest in art whatsoever, I would listen. And if they created some amalgamation of those two shows together, I would love the result. The condition for liking a podcast has nearly ceased to be a question of topic in my mind, having gradually shifted to instead become a question of hosts, production values, personality, and intelligence of discourse. I recognize that I am the outlier though, and that for the most part people choose podcasts based on topic. As such, a model where hosts change topics abruptly every twenty-five episodes could find great difficulty gaining traction, and for that reason the model, while an interesting exercise, will likely remain only that for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Much less polarizing than shifting topics, the seasonal model could more easily facilitate various podcasting models instead, to much less controversy. Today, podcasts generally fall in to one of three different formats: talk shows, interviews, and panels. <em>Hypercritical</em> where Dan and John discussed topics as co-hosts conformed to the first; <em>CMD+SPACE</em>, as an interview show, fits the second; and <em>Accidental Tech Podcast</em> approximates the third form. Although other podcasts like <em>The Menu Bar</em> and <em>The Distraction</em> blur those lines as they go between a talk show, interview, and panel discussion depending on the episode, sticking to a single form is by far the most common practice for a number of valid reasons. For instance, after going through all the trouble to build a compelling roster of future guests, it makes little sense to also plan on discussing topics with a regular co-host on the same show. In the same vein, putting three or four competing personalities, each with something unique and interesting to say, on a discussion panel simply for the sake of hosting such a dialogue has time and time again proved far from the best way to hold an engaging and informative conversation.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I do not mean to say panel discussions cannot be done well, merely that a show intended to conform to the interview style should not bootstrap itself into something it is not.</p>

<p>Apparently, Horace Dediu feels the same way: since June of 2011, Horace has conducted <em>The Critical Path</em> as a talk show bordering on the interview style. While recently the show has gradually returned to its roots, for quite some time it fit much more closely into the interview format where Dan and, later, Moiss would occasionally interject in an otherwise informative monologue by Horace characteristic of long form interviews. Still framed as a talk show though, Horace started another podcast, <em>High Density</em>, to serve the purpose of an interview show where he could invite guests to discuss various topics not covered on <em>The Critical Path</em>. The seasonal model could, perhaps, have solved Horace&#8217;s problem without the need to create an entirely new podcast.</p>

<p>Finally, the seasonal model could also help producers capture additional revenue from existing, loyal fans in the form of post-show monetization. Similar to the manner many television networks perpetuate revenue from shows like <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> and <em>House</em> by releasing box sets after each season, in the event that podcasters adopt the seasonal model they, too, could release &#8220;box sets&#8221; after each season featuring high-quality audio versions bundled with additional extras like extra footage should any have been cut out in editing and transcripts. This would not only be a great way to attain additional revenue from a property that would have otherwise existed only to sap bandwidth each month, but also a great way to give listeners a way to archive and preserve their favorite programs in high-fidelity.</p>

<p>Obviously it would take a very popular show to fully realize the advantages of a seasonal model, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;like the linkblog&#160;&#8212;&#160;poor and inappropriate implementations of it would cheapen its existence at some point in time. Its many advantages, however, likely outweigh some of the inconveniences this hastily thought-out implementation presents, inconveniences that would undoubtedly fade or altogether vanish with time and experience.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="CommercialAppeal">"Commercial Appeal"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#CommercialAppeal">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Unlike its predecessors, and especially &#8220;&#8217;Tis the Season&#8221;, I have little to say regarding this section: if Dan and Merlin decide to spend five minutes describing Squarespace, I have no problem with that; they obviously use the service and enjoy it immensely, and I take great pleasure in listening to the pair go back and forth about something so inspiring. If, conversely, they feel ambivalent towards the sponsor, that invariably comes through in a noticeably less-enthusiastic ad read and often leads to a shorter spot. And in the rare case that they do go on to talk about a product obviously of little interest to them in great detail, I can at least rest assured in the knowledge that they received a handsome compensation for their time.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="ShowNotes">"Show Notes"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ShowNotes">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Again, I have little to say about this section as well given that, for the most part, I agree with Harry in this regard: most shows do get this aspect, at the very least, right. Even his suggestion that producers break the notes into categories, while slightly pedantic, would not necessarily be a bad one did I not expect show notes to appear in the order they were discussed, as I am sure many others do as well. Any other presentation, however logical in the abstract, would ultimately prove much more cumbersome to the vast majority of listeners who look for that one calendar app next to the ad spot because that is where it occurred in the discussion.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="TheFuture">"The Future"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheFuture">#</a></span></h2>

<p>I cannot condemn Harry&#8217;s advice as categorically bad for the vast majority of podcasts recorded and released from a bedroom on nights and weekends, nor can I promote it as superb advice that will make such shows &#8220;stand above the rest.&#8221; In fact, Harry&#8217;s suggestions would go a long way in improving really <em>bad</em> podcasts, and at that level perhaps his advice would serve to differentiate such podcasts from the rest. I can, however, almost universally condemn Harry&#8217;s suggestions in regards to the really <em>great</em> podcasts.</p>

<p>Applying a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach to such a diverse industry would simultaneously crush its best aspects and commoditize the market in one fell swoop. A vast diversity in runtime, production models, and topics gives this space a unique aspect absent in nearly all mainstream media outlets. If we crush that uniqueness here and now, before podcasts become mainstream, what then would we find ourselves left with but terrestrial radio?</p>

<p>The coming months hold both great change and growth for this industry, of this I am sure. In the end, the sixty-minute, heavily-edited shows that traditional media outlets eek out as an afterthought will not have been the shows we look back upon as instigators of a revolution, but the stogy vestiges of a bygone era. Rather, those that transcend this growth will be the shows known for continually pushing the traditional boundaries of what it means to call something a podcast, and drawing flak for it in the process. Not unlike a certain technology company we all like to write about, in fact, but I will leave those parallels for you to draw on your own.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;The various <em>5by5 Specials</em> episodes recorded after Apple&#8217;s iPhone events are prime examples of the shortcomings this format suffers from. In particular, throughout <a href="http://5by5.tv/specials/22">episode twenty-two</a> I felt none of the show&#8217;s impressive list of hosts&#160;&#8212;&#160;including Horace Dediu, Benedict Evans, and Christina Warren&#160;&#8212;&#160;had ample room to talk around each other and share their intriguing insights. <em>The Changelog</em>, in my brief encounters with the show, suffers from a similar problem of hosts tripping over each other while attempting to speak, compounded with what I can only characterize as a confounding lack of desire to speak. During the few episodes I listened to before abandoning <em>The Changelog</em>, both the guest and co-hosts had to prompt each other to pick up the conversation after an awkward period of silence.</p>

<p>Exactly a week ago today Chris Gonzales of Unretrofied wrote an article called <a href="http://unretrofied.com/blog/2013/9/26/ios-7-and-the-state-of-podcast-apps"><em>iOS 7 and the State of Podcast Apps</em></a>, a rather presumptuous title given the article&#8217;s actual contents, that I initially did not plan on linking to or writing anything about. At the very bottom of his article though, Chris tacked on a bracket-thetical that gave me pause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[Writing Unretrofied full-time is a dream of mine. It would mean the world to me if you&#8217;d consider supporting this site by becoming a member, which only costs a cup of coffee per month. If you sign up before Sunday, October 20th 2013, then you&#8217;ll be entered into a drawing for some really cool prizes.]&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even I, both a consumer of and contributor to a community where independent writing is not only unremarkable but common, sometimes forget that behind my favorite websites, working diligently on my favorite apps, sits a single writer or developer whose livelihood depends on my fickle whims. Who, in return for a negligible amount of money, creates content I enjoy each and every day or improves upon an app I rely on constantly. Occasionally even I forget this; and yet we expect the masses to come upon this realization themselves, and decry its absence with increasing vocality every day? This is absurd; asinine, one might go so far as to say. Yet it has become the rallying cry lately, the banner behind which all gather to ask for more money in exchange for their wares.</p>

<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong: I absolutely agree with the overarching sentiment that through various mechanisms the masses have grown accustomed to assigning inordinately and undeservedly-low monetary values to content and services; that much I would be foolish to argue against. The problem I have with the discussion surrounding this issue, however, instead lies in the mixture of bafflement, indignation, and confusion creators feel towards those who do not fully understand the value proposition laid out before them, for therein lies the problem: they don&#8217;t understand that writing Untretrofied is Chris Gonzales&#8217;s dream, or that Shawn Blanc quit his job and supports his growing family with his site alone. That connection has not been made clear to them, and until it is obviated we will continue down this path in a race to the bottom.</p>

<p>There is a larger, more salient point to be made here about App Store pricing and the like, but it&#8217;s late to make the connection and I&#8217;m tired, much as that topic is.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, as I scrolled through my RSS reader and came across a particularly interesting or attractive cabin, I would send the page to Instapaper. Unfortunately, most of those cabins got lost in translation, so to speak, and never made it to this site for one reason or another. I&#8217;m not here to assign blame though, but instead to show off some really great cabins.</p>

<p>Initially, I considered starting at the beginning as I did upon discovering <a href="http://cabinporn.com">the Cabin Porn Tumblr</a> last winter; having grown to 111 pages as of this writing, however, such a feat proved too daunting a task to attempt on nights and weekends. Instead, I began roughly where I had left off:</p>

<ul>
<li>Atop the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/48760380209/yurt-across-from-mt-elbert-at-14-400-feet-the">a yurt</a>. Alternative structures such as this <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/frameless-geodesic-dome.html">have</a> always <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/53954765056/diogene-cabin-concept-by-renzo-piano-and-rpbw-for">interested</a> me, whether a simple tent or something much larger like this yurt.</li>
<li>Bridging the gap between tents, yurts, and the more solid cabins, I found this <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/49215690963/hybrid-shelter-at-fforest-camp-near-cardigan">hybrid shelter</a> at Fforest Camp near Cardigan, Wales, a very interesting idea. With a permanent structure in place presumably for those amenities tents and the like generally have difficulty offering, this shelter combined the best aspects of both types by using tents to greatly expand the available living space. What a great idea.</li>
<li>Brining this back to full-on cabins, I sat and thought about this next one&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/49272499740/abandoned-cabin-in-germany-near-the-austrian">a small, abandoned cabin</a> in Germany near the Austrian border&#160;&#8212;&#160;for a while, trying to decide what I wanted to say about it. A while passed and I still could not quite put to words the curious feeling this image brought up in me, almost a sense of deja vu as if I had been there before despite its place nearly halfway across the world. Coincidentally, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/50606001366/abandoned-cabin-in-bavarian-alps-near-unterwossen">this abandoned cabin in the Bavarian Alps</a> looks almost identical in both structural design and its surrounding landscape.</li>
<li>I had no trouble with <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/49360714600/chisepo-hut-on-mt-mulanje-malawi-photograph-by">these two &#8220;huts&#8221; on Mt. Mulanje, Malawi</a>, on the other hand: more so than actual huts, however, the landscape in which they were set reminded me of many a mountainside I drove by and hiked upon while in South Africa almost two years ago now. They bring back some great memories.</li>
<li>To break my four-post streak, lest it seem as if I had decided to link every single submission this next cabin, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/49437377426/fishing-hut-on-isla-del-sol-in-lake-titicaca">a small fishing hut</a>, comes straight from Lake Titicaca, Bolivia. Like many of my favorite cabins, more so than the actual structure I love the landscape surrounding it: those mountains look like something taken out of a movie. And with the picturesque lake to the front and a nice copse of trees opposite the mountainside, I would have a hard time thinking of a more beautiful place to live in.</li>
<li>This <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/50012211418/stone-cellar-in-elliston-newfoundland">stone cellar in Elliston, Newfoundland</a>, reminds me of the shelter the U.S. military exiled Lieutenant John Dunbar to during most of one of my favorite films of all time, <em>Dances with Wolves</em>. <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/50913927775/tipi-in-the-alaskan-woods-contributed-by">This tipi</a>, similarly, and its location in the snowy pines of Alaska looks just like the tribe&#8217;s winter encampment at the end of the movie.</li>
<li>I love <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/50430113236/dwelling-on-the-drina-river-near-the-town-of">this little cabin</a> built atop a small island in the middle of a river in Serbia.</li>
<li>I seriously doubt I would be able to tear myself away from its view if I ever came across <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/51512909202/privy-on-red-top-mountain-wenatchee-national">this privy on Red Top Mountain in Washington</a>. Absolutely beautiful.</li>
<li>A bit of perspective in <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/52015172703/reindeer-herding-cabin-at-the-foot-of">a reindeer herding cabin in North Sweden</a> and this <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/52161928868/alpine-cabin-near-djupvatnet-norway">alpine cabin in Norway</a>.</li>
<li>I linked to <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/52879884360/exceptional-adirondack-lean-to-with-field-stone">this adirondack</a> in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/another-cabin-porn-update.html"><em>Another Cabin Porn Update</em></a>. From that article: &#8220;I slept in this very adirondack one cold and rainy weekend a few years ago, and have spent many a night in an adirondack since then. Wonderful little buildings and a great way to spend the night.&#8221;</li>
<li>A <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/53772442672/pod-house-in-flims-switzerland">pod house in Switzerland</a>. Surrounded by feet of snow and dense trees on all sides, this looks like a great way to spend the cold winter months.</li>
<li>This <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/57536545665/shingled-cabin-on-the-island-of-islesboro-maine">shingled cabin in Maine</a> makes me want to travel there even more. Perhaps someday.</li>
<li>I love this <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/62755162360/tree-house-outside-aarhus-denmark-contributed">treehouse in Denmark</a>. Having always wanted to build one of these myself, I can only imagine what it would be like to both build and have this treehouse in my own back yard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Until next time the Cabin Porn tumblr is updated, then, I present my favorites cabins going all the way back to April.</p>

<p>Number ten, Tonya Lavel&#8217;s, and the eleventh, David Pepper&#8217;s, were reasonably good. With those two exceptions though, these were almost universally both terrible and utterly hilarious.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-26 12:52:33-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/26 12:52:33 EST</time>
<p>An excerpt from the Popular Science article in which they laid out their reasoning behind turning comments off. As <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/09/24/popsci-comments">John Gruber said</a>, it&#8217;s hard to believe it took them this long.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A politically motivated, decades-long war on expertise has eroded the popular consensus on a wide variety of scientifically validated topics. Everything, from evolution to the origins of climate change, is mistakenly up for grabs again. Scientific certainty is just another thing for two people to &#8216;debate&#8217; on television. And because comments sections tend to be a grotesque reflection of the media culture surrounding them, the cynical work of undermining bedrock scientific doctrine is now being done beneath our own stories, within a website devoted to championing science.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the point where I pick up my weary banner and resume railing against faux-feminists, for I see a strong resemblance in the difficulty Popular Science faces in maintaining intelligent discourse and the apparent inability for the vast majority of those wanting to challenge misogynistic behavior to do so either appropriately or intelligently, much less both. Popular Science faces a highly politicized discussion in a field that should, ideally, operate without such ponderous constraints, much like the discussions around misogyny has devolved into an unproductive, highly-emotional flame war. Popular Science could turn off its comments and at the very least curb this behavior in their small corner of the internet; unfortunately, we have no such remedy for the writings of faux-feminists.</p>

<p>I absolutely love podcasts. Much to my girlfriend&#8217;s confusion, I might add. After Marco Arment sold Instapaper in April, after Yahoo! bought Tumblr.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in May, and after he sold The Magazine shortly thereafter, only in my wildest dreams did I hope his elusive next venture would lead Marco to create a podcast client. Then, last Sunday at XOXO, my dream came true.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s putting it slightly melodramatically, but to say that I&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the collective internet as well&#160;&#8212;&#160;am extremely excited for Overcast would be an understatement of gargantuan proportions. I can&#8217;t wait for Overcast to come out; I plan on purchasing it on day one, as I&#8217;m sure many others will as well. Despite Marco&#8217;s modest expectations for Overcast, I would be surprised if it <em>didn&#8217;t</em> take the podcast client market by storm: the same design sensibilities that made Instapaper and The Magazine so popular&#160;&#8212;&#160;one need only look to <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/09/23/overcast-coming-soon">the announcement Marco posted</a> for an idea as to those proven ideals&#160;&#8212;&#160;will almost undoubtedly make Overcast similarly popular and, hopefully, a smashing success.</p>

<p>Good luck to you, Marco; we await Overcast&#8217;s release in eager anticipation.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;I can&#8217;t help but think of Ben Brooks&#8217; article <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/05/tumblr-yahoo/"><em>Yahoo! + Tumblr. = !!</em></a> on the topic every time I think about this acquisition.</p>

<p>Another great article by Ben Thompson, this time on Clay Christensen&#8217;s interesting disruption theories and Apple&#8217;s approach in making products that both defy them and motivate people to purchase en masse. Come for the insights into Apple, and stay for his dissection of Christensen&#8217;s widely-regarded theory; this article is well worth the read.</p>

<p>I realize in my last two articles, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/instapaper-5.html"><em>Instapaper 5</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in which I made a number of proposals for Instapaper 5&#160;&#8212;&#160;and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/betaworks-releases-instapaper-5.html"><em>Betaworks Releases Instapaper 5</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in which I conveyed my mostly positive feelings on the new release&#160;&#8212;&#160;I likely appeared very critical of Betaworks and their continued work on Instapaper. This is not the case: while I do feel a better launch strategy entailing a service-wide design overhaul and one in which they added a larger set of new features to Instapaper would have greatly helped the platform, I am not of the opinion that Betaworks did not improve the app in Instapaper 5; the impressive new InstaRank feature is a prime example of this.</p>

<p>That said though, I cannot help but feel that this feature, too, would have benefited from some additional development time. I may&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the blog post linked earlier confirms this suspicion&#160;&#8212;&#160;be an outlier in that I prefer to keep my Instapaper queue small, in the four to eight article range, and read in chronological order. This is a roundabout way to say that I will find little use in Instapaper&#8217;s new Popularity sorting algorithm, but not that I could not at some point in the future: a section similar to The Feature&#160;&#8212;&#160;available under &#8220;Browse&#8221; on the iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;populated with articles ranked using the InstaRank algorithm through which I could find and save articles to my queue for consumption at a later date would be very useful indeed.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-25 16:40:15-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/25 16:40:15 EST</time>
<p>&#8220;Looking again at that chart, and with the realities of these three markets in mind, it&#8217;s not so much that the iPhone has saturated the American-style and European-style markets, and ought to focus on the Asian-style one; rather, the iPhone has saturated the high end in all three markets  the high end just varies in accessibility ($200 for American-style, $650 for Asian-style). And, if you accept that the iPhone is in roughly the same competitive position in all three markets  that the difference in market share is due to inherent structure of the market  then it&#8217;s not at all obvious Apple should focus on the SE Asia-style market. In fact, it&#8217;s obvious they shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>A characteristically fascinating article by Ben Thompson explaining the logic behind Apple&#8217;s refusal to enter the low-end market as many predicted it would with a C model, and why Apple chose to position the 5C where it did in the iPhone line. His work is quickly becoming some of my favorite writing to read, alongside that of Horace Dediu and Benedict Evans.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-25 12:52:40-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/25 12:52:40 EST</time>
<p>By now I realize this issue has largely fallen to the wayside, as its various permutations invariably do seemingly momentarily after gaining any significant traction, despite the condemnation many so readily metered out. Regardless of its fall from the collective&#8217;s fickle favor though, the event and ensuing discussions nevertheless merit some examination.</p>

<p>Early Monday afternoon, various parties on Twitter began calling attention to a FAQ entry for the UK charity and conference event organizer Entangled Bank. It came to my attention via Matt Gemmel, who <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgemmell/status/382117765059846145">posted a screenshot of the page</a> before Entangled Bank pulled it down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is what the FAQ entry said before @entangledbank deleted it. http://t.co/J7T5rwMvUr&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entry in question read as follows, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I am a fanatical, misdirected &#8216;feminist&#8217;. May I drone on about the lack of women in the line-up and despatch abusive, bigoted, mis-spelt, ungrammatical missives to the organizers and presenters?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;No. Please save your talents for Twitter and Facebook, that is what they are for.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<em>We&#8217;re actually very disappointed that none of our female invitees accepted</em>, but that is just how it was. <em>As scientists we have no choice but to accept reality</em>. Wanting something to be otherwise does not make it so.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I retweeted Matt Gemmell&#8217;s tweet not because I agreed with him whatsoever, but because I found Entangled Bank&#8217;s entry an extremely accurate, if not the most accurate, characterization of the dumbed-down, omni-present, poorly-formed, mutated feminist vitriol every public-facing individual or company must operate in fear of these days.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, responding to another twitter user Mike Lee, Matt indirectly <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgemmell/status/382119729303138304">commented on the affair</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;@bmf Cruel little boys have to be punished in order to learn. I hope some of the speakers cancel.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the life of me I cannot discern why Matt Gemmell and the multitude of other armchair activists jumped on Entangled Bank&#8217;s FAQ entry; they did everything humanly possible, and in the end, when none of the female presenters accepted the invitation to speak at the conference accepted, had to work with what they got. Short of putting signs up on the sidewalk looking for token women presenters, I cannot see any way Entangled Bank could have diversified its lineup. And at that point, does not such a course of action defeat the purpose? Or perhaps they took issue with Entangled Banks&#8217; characterization of the self-proclaimed faux-feminists they knew would take issue with the unavoidable lack of women on the panels, to which I would say at least they learned to spell.</p>

<p>I found the whole affair quite puzzling; another example of the utterly ridiculous lengths individuals will go to in the tired name of protecting women&#8217;s rights. Unfortunately, it will not be the last case, nor even the most trivial. The tendency to blow such events massively out of proportion or fabricate offenses in completely innocuous places has infected the common narrative like a cancerous cell, spreading to touch almost every single conversation in varying degrees. Someday I hope to see this flamewar evolve into an intelligent conversation through which we as a community can make a measurable amount of progress. Unfortunately, I do not see that happening in the near future.</p>

<p>Every so often I like to take a break from the whole technology gamut and read something else. Preferably, something exceptional like <em>Coronado High</em> from The Atavist. Telling the fascinating origin story of what grew from a few California kids running drugs to a multi-million dollar narcotics empire, <em>Coronado High</em> is much more than a fantastically-written, gripping tale of a bygone era. I wouldn&#8217;t dream of spoiling it for you though: this is one of those articles you just can&#8217;t afford to miss.</p>

<p>Last week I acquired access to the Instapaper beta prior to its launch alongside iOS 7. I chronicled that story in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/i-finally-understand-bias.html"><em>I Finally Understand Bias</em></a>. Since then, I have put off writing about the beta for a number of reasons: as a beta, the onus would have been on me to explain every single aspect of the new design or include numerous screenshots. Unlike the Federico Viticcis of the world, I did not find that prospect particularly appealing. More importantly though, I did not&#160;&#8212;&#160;do not&#160;&#8212;&#160;consider the app ready for widespread use, and at the very least not worthy of a version increment. iOS 7 or not, I am of the opinion that Betaworks should have forgone releasing Instapaper 5 quite so soon.</p>

<p>As many have <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/instapaper-5-0-sorting-and-filtering-options-tweaked-interface-for-ios-7/">already</a> pointed <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/61609255324">out</a>, Instapaper 5 is little more than a facelift instead of the complete rewrite so many other app makers have chosen to undertake in preparation for iOS 7&#8217;s release. With the exception of new sorting options, a few additional gestures, and the ability to filter articles based on supposed reading time, Instapaper 5 is, for the most part, the same app Marco Arment sold Betaworks roughly four months ago. Sure, Betaworks revamped the interface and refreshed the icon, and both are welcome and very attractive improvements, but look any deeper than these superficial changes and Instapaper remains, for better or worse, the same app we all know and love.</p>

<p>Earlier today, I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrock/status/380135298946306048">a tweet Jeff Rock made just before iOS 7 dropped</a>, which Marco Arment retweeted: &#8220;I&#8217;d rather see your iOS 7 redesign in November than see your half-assed reskin in September.&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to call Instapaper&#8217;s redesign a &#8220;half-assed reskin&#8221;, but I can agree with the sentiment he expresses. Tapbots, at the opposite end of the spectrum, chose <a href="https://twitter.com/tapbots/status/380345858300317696">a completely different route</a>: &#8220;Our iOS 7 versions are running a bit late, but we promise they&#8217;ll be worth the wait.&#8221; I would have much rather waited until November for a version of Instapaper that could blow me away than have Instapaper 5 as-is just because Apple released iOS 7, and I&#8217;m sure the vast majority of Instapaper&#8217;s user base would agree with that sentiment.</p>

<p>I understand the desire to have a new, revamped iteration of Instapaper available as soon as iOS 7 hits the market, and the potential disadvantage passing up on this opportunity could bring. As Marco said in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/11/fertile-ground"><em>Fertile Ground</em></a>, iOS 7 presents an excellent opportunity for newcomers to challenge incumbents in the app space and gain significant market share. I also understand, however, that Betaworks made the conscious decision to release a product before it&#8217;s time because of an artificial deadline. Unfortunately for Betaworks, I believe many others will come to this same conclusion.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-19 06:02:39-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/19 06:02:39 EST</time>
<p>Last week, amidst the frenzy preluding Apple&#8217;s impending iPhone event, I posted an article titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/intapaper-5.html"><em>Instapaper 5</em></a>. I did not have early access to a beta or any insight as to the direction Betaworks planned on taking the service; instead, I merely wished to put forth a possible launch strategy for the upcoming update and outline a number of improvements I had been considering. I posted the article with minor expectations, thinking it would attract the usual eight to twelve pageviews; what came next took me completely by surprise.</p>

<p>Four days later, completely out of the blue, I unlocked my phone to find that I had an unread Twitter mention. Someone named Brian Donohue had read and enjoyed my article, it seemed; I was flattered. Later, when I remembered to open Tweetbot and actually read the message, I was surprised to see that he wished to speak with me. On the phone. Who does that anymore? But his request had piqued my interest, and I agreed.</p>

<p>We set up a call for Sunday afternoon. When the time came to finally dial Brian&#8217;s number, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel slightly apprehensive. I had climbed atop a lofty pedestal and presumed to tell this large software company all the ways in which they had failed, after all; who was I to speak with any authority? I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, so when Brian nonchalantly answered the phone after a few rings I did my best to present a calm and collected facade.</p>

<p>Ironically, just then the call dropped.</p>

<p>After reestablishing the connection, Brian picked right back up where we had left off. Over the next half hour we talked about Instapaper, its website, and the iOS app; about my article, how much he had enjoyed it, and how the &#8220;higher-ups at Betaworks&#8221; found it interesting as well; and most importantly, we talked about the direction Betaworks had Instapaper heading in: design decisions, where the company&#8217;s focus lies, and the avenues Instapaper&#8217;s developers were actively exploring. And then, as if all this&#160;&#8212;&#160;details and anecdotes<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I would have expected out of an Instapaper tell-all book that will never get written&#160;&#8212;&#160;was not enough, Brian offered me access to the beta.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t say &#8220;Yes&#8221; fast enough.</p>

<p>The entire interaction&#160;&#8212;&#160;some of which I have chronicled above, and some of which I have left out; the more significant portion, however, I have refrained from sharing just yet&#160;&#8212;&#160;gave me an incredible feeling of gratitude towards Brian in particular as the one who had reached out to me, but Betaworks as well for giving him the green-light to bring me into the loop. Brian could have left it at that: after taking the time to talk about Instapaper and then giving me access to the beta, I could not have asked for more. A few minutes after our call ended though, I got a cheery email from Brian with credentials to the beta and then, at the end, an offer I still have a hard time believing: citing two particular lines of my blog post, Brian offered to add a feature to Instapaper for me. In my response, I struggled against the urge to proclaim my eternal gratitude should he choose to implement it.</p>

<p>After all this, how could I not feel indebted to Brian and, by extension, Betaworks? He had gone above and beyond the call of duty in offering to add a feature to one of my favorite apps, and asked for nothing in return. After all this, I wanted to do something in return. Specifically, I wanted to show my gratitude by doing the thing I do best: write, and write positive things about Betaworks and its products. And just as that thought went through my mind, it finally clicked: I finally understood why people accuse John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple of coloring their opinions concerning Apple. When a seemingly faceless corporation reaches out, it&#8217;s hard not to feel indebted to them, just as I felt a great debt of gratitude towards Brian and Betaworks as I imagine so, too, did Jim Dalrymple and John Gruber once upon a time. Experience and time allowed them to temper that emotion, however, as I must now temper the same sentiment in my own writing concerning Instapaper in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-19 05:57:48-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/19 05:57:48 EST</time>
<p>Yesterday, Apple lifted the press embargo on both iPhone and iOS 7 reviews in conjunction with the operating system&#8217;s release to the general public. Like most of the internet, I got little to no work done once the reviews and new apps started rolling out. I did, however, succeed in pulling together this list and brief overview of the best reviews I came across throughout the day, for your reading pleasure.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="JohnGruber">John Gruber: [*The iPhone 5S and 5C*](http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c)<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JohnGruber">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Right off the bat, John opened with a four paragraph-long footnote presenting the logical argument against Apple&#8217;s new naming convention. I particularly enjoyed this portion of the review. With the stylistic issues out of the way, John began the article by explaining the reality of the iPhone 5C as a repackaged and rebranded iPhone 5, a topic <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-new-kid-on-the-block.html">I</a> and others have beaten to death over the past week. Despite the opinion&#8217;s prevalence now, I drew some satisfaction seeing it come from John as well. Then he tackled the notion that Apple can no longer innovate under Tim Cook. This topic obviously bothers him, and it showed through in his writing before he moved on to talk specific aspects of the new devices.</p>

<p>First, he explained the logic behind Apple&#8217;s move to a 64bit architecture. I still can&#8217;t quite say I fully understand the reasons behind this transition, but after reading John&#8217;s explanation I at least have some idea and enough knowledge to recognize the move as a very forward-thinking one. This topic conveniently transitioned in to a discussion of the 5S&#8217;s speed&#160;&#8212;&#160;unsurprisingly, a massive increase: on par with John&#8217;s 2008 MacBook Pro, in fact&#160;&#8212;&#160;and battery life which, despite the significant performance jump, still managed to increase ever so slightly over the 5. John then moved on to talk about Touch ID and the camera before closing his article and putting the final nail in the &#8220;Apple can&#8217;t innovate&#8221; argument.</p>

<p>Shawn Blanc said it best when <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/gruber-iphone-5s/">he linked</a> to John Gruber&#8217;s review of the new iPhones: &#8220;This is Daring Fireball at its best&#160;&#8212;&#160;technical, thoughtful, and fun.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t agree more; it was for this kind of article that I subscribed to John Gruber&#8217;s blog, and he did not disappoint.</p>

<p>If you only read one device review today, let it be this one.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="JimDalrymple">Jim Dalrymple: [*Review: iPhone 5c and 5s*](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/17/review-iphone-5c-and-iphone-5s/)<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JimDalrymple">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Whereas John approached his review from a more technical standpoint and peppered the piece with personal anecdotes, Jim took the opposite route and wrote entirely based on his own experience with the devices. Personally, I prefer the former to the latter. That&#8217;s not to say, though, that there is no merit to Jim&#8217;s review: unlike John Gruber, who chose to talk about the 5S to the exclusion of the 5C as a technically similar device to the 5, Jim gave the 5C a fair amount of thought and &#8220;airtime&#8221;, if you will. Jim also devoted a portion of his article to iOS 7, a topic John Gruber has yet to write about in this capacity.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="FedericoViticci">Federico Viticci: [*Living with iOS 7*](http://www.macstories.net/stories/living-with-ios-7/)<span>&nbsp;<a href="#FedericoViticci">#</a></span></h3>

<p>If you read John&#8217;s article reviewing the iPhone 5S and 5C but met its end with disappointment at no mention of iOS 7, or wanted more detail than Jim put forth in his review, Federico Viticci wrote a fantastic(ally long) piece wholly devoted to the latest iteration of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system in which he discussed, in exhaustive detail, every app, screen, desntion, convention, and paradigm present throughout iOS 7, all the way down to the reasons Apple&#8217;s designers made the choices they did. In particular, I found Federico&#8217;s penultimate section, &#8220;Stability, Polish, and iPad&#8221;, especially interesting given his thoughts regarding the suitability of iOS 7 on an iPhone versus an iPad, only rivaled in his conclusion during which Federico looked forward to the future of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system and app ecosystem alike. Unsurprisingly, Federico&#8217;s piece is one of the best articles about iOS 7 on the internet.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReneRitchie">Rene Ritchie: [*iOS 7 review*](http://www.imore.com/ios-7-review)<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReneRitchie">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Right alongside Federico&#8217;s article, however, we have Rene Ritchie of iMore with his review of iOS 7. Essentially, Rene&#8217;s article is to Federico&#8217;s what John Gruber&#8217;s iPhone 5S review is to Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s: whereas John took a quantitative approach, choosing to base his review on the technical details supplemented by his own opinions and trademark whit, Jim wrote from a more qualitative standpoint in chronicling his personal experiences with the new iPhones. In the context of these two iOS 7 reviews Federico&#8217;s, which certainly covered every important aspect, also focused heavily on his own opinions, whereas Rene based his in cold, hard facts supplemented with his own thoughts. So while both pieces are inarguably excellent, they are, nevertheless, geared towards two different audiences much as John and Jim&#8217;s reviews are.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rene made no mention of stability&#160;&#8212;&#160;or lack thereof&#160;&#8212;&#160;in iOS 7 on either the iPhone or the iPad.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="AnandTechsLalShimpi">AnandTech's Lal Shimpi: [*The iPhone 5s Review*](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7335/the-iphone-5s-review)<span>&nbsp;<a href="#AnandTechsLalShimpi">#</a></span></h3>

<p>After seeing both John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple link to this review, I went in to it with high expectations. Thirteen pages later, Lal Shimpi did not disappoint. While I did appreciate its depth, leaving quite literally nothing regarding the iPhone 5S untouched, it was <em>extremely</em> long, and much too long to read in a single sitting.</p>

<p>A great resource if you are looking for specific and highly-detailed information contained within one or two sections, but altogether overwhelming&#160;&#8212;&#160;to say the least&#160;&#8212;&#160;for anyone casually curious about Apple&#8217;s latest offering.</p>

<p>Now, having read every major review of both iOS 7 and the new iPhones, I feel I have appropriately prepared myself for what comes next: iOS 7 on my own devices, and a brand-new, &#8220;Space Gray&#8221; iPhone 5S in the coming weeks. I go into this fully expecting <em>not</em> to write any sort of review for either product. After all, in the face of these excellent articles, what else could I possibly say?</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-18 23:14:02-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/18 23:14:02 EST</time>
<p>Early yesterday evening I saw co-editors Alexia Tsotsis and Eric Eldon post an apology for an alleged inappropriate presentation made at TechCrunch Disrupt. Dismissing the short article as a response to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/pycon-2013-sexism-dongle-richards">yet another activist blowing an innocuous joke way out of proportion</a> though, I paid it little attention until coming across <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/techcrunch-disrupt-kicks-off-with-titstare-app-and-fa-1274394925">Gawker&#8217;s coverage</a> of the event later that evening. Like an article taken directly from The Onion&#8217;s homepage, I read about and subsequently watched two incredibly inappropriate presentations with varying degrees of disbelief throughout. More than the actual presentations though, because God only knows enough will be written about them in the coming days, I would like to focus on my original sentiment when I came across TechCrunch&#8217;s apology for failing to screen the exhibitions.</p>

<p>As I said, upon coming across TechCrunch&#8217;s article I completely disregarded the whole affair. Granted, at that point I had not seen the actual presentations, but the mere fact that I possessed absolutely no interest in the cause behind such a large and generally respected publication posting such an apology is, I believe, indicative of a systemic problem within the tech community especially.</p>

<p>A few years ago, before the linkblog format had gained widespread traction and prior to Apple&#8217;s climb to fame, the community of commentators surround Apple consisted of a relatively small subset of bloggers dedicated to writing about the company they loved so dearly. Today, that group has grown out of its designation as a &#8220;community&#8221;: with more and more linkblogs appearing every day, the once close-knit community has become both massive and fragmented as increasingly more people jump on the Apple bandwagon in an attempt at grabbing some of the attention surround the world&#8217;s largest tech company. The group&#8217;s growth in popularity has unearthed a number of excellent writers with very interesting opinions to share, such as Shawn Blanc. Inspired by John Gruber&#8217;s blog Daring Fireball, Shawn Blanc launched his own site in 2007. For all the notable writers this revolution brought about, however, it led to a net decline in the quality of content this once-elite group produced as more and more writers both without anything meaningful to say and dispossessing the ability to say it well sought to make a name for themselves.</p>

<p>Today, years later, we see the same thing happening again in another segment of the tech industry: those discussing the issue of gender inequality amongst our ranks. A long time ago, in a galaxy not too far away, the thought of chronicling one&#8217;s encounters with gender discrimination and offensive behavior would have been pointless. Who would have listened? Who would have cared? Thankfully, we advanced from those dark ages and for a time, those discussing these issues made progress and effected some degree of change within their microcosms. But eventually this, too, went the way of the linkblog and exploded in popularity. Seemingly overnight it shifted from a topic of constructive discourse to the latest buzzword, and the internet exploded with story after story, article after article, piece after piece decrying women&#8217;s suffrage in this industry. In accordance with its growth in popularity, the intelligence of the surrounding discussions moved in the opposite direction much like that of the Apple commentary pre- and post-Apple becoming the world&#8217;s premiere tech company.</p>

<p>Now, misogyny has devolved to an umbrella term for any action from which a member of the female gender could, in some circumstance and with a good stretch of the imagination, find some offensive aspect. As the collective has trivialized this term, we have become Increasingly desensitized. Every time someone stands up and unnecessarily cries &#8220;sexist&#8221;, each and every time someone&#8217;s overly-feministic article goes viral, our perception of each term and what it means to act sexist or identify with feminists degrades ever so slightly. The justified accounts shore that decay, but with such a low signal-to-noise ratio they only delay the inevitable.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t deny the existence of sexism and misogyny; I live in the real world just like everyone else. I do, however, strongly disagree with how frivolous the terms have become, bandied about like iPhone rumors in every single article I read. It not only degrades the seriousness of the issue, but the surrounding conversation as well. I&#8217;m talking to you, armchair activist: your anecdotes&#160;&#8212;&#160;your exaggerated, imagined offenses and self-righteous anger&#160;&#8212;&#160;do not help the cause you so readily profess to support. In the end, those articles weaken and dilute the discussion. Because when someone does actually encounter sexist behavior or misogynistic tendencies whether in the workplace, at a conference, or anywhere else, all I hear is your story about the time you overheard two guys say something out of context while walking down the street, and how it infuriated you on behalf of the entire female gender. Because you aren&#8217;t a woman, after all, but you do have a friend who just so happens to fall into the feminine category and this gives you the authority&#160;&#8212;&#160;nay, the audacity to write as if you ever, for a single day in your life, experienced any disadvantage because of your gender.</p>

<p>Craig Hockenberry making a very apropos comparison between the Mercedes-Benz S-Class line and Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5S. Perhaps just as interesting as his thoughts on the iPhone, however, were his thoughts on this particular vehicular product line, however brief.</p>

<p>I always find a writer traditionally steeped in technology taking a step in to the world of cars disproportionately fascinating. That meticulous nature, attention to detail, and, most important of all, the ability to take in to account the intangibles&#160;&#8212;&#160;aspects of a car that don&#8217;t appear on a feature checklist&#160;&#8212;&#160;make for an invariably interesting read.</p>

<p>The interesting trend, I think, as I work through my Instapaper queue from last week reading various writers&#8217; opinions, is everyone recognizing Apple&#8217;s strategy with the 5C as exactly what it is: a marketing gimmick designed to give them cause to market both this year&#8217;s top model and last year&#8217;s hardware.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-15 12:56:44-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/15 12:56:44 EST</time>
<p>In the first in a wonderful series of articles, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/09/11/c-is-for-cognitive-illusion/"><em>C is for Cognitive Illusion</em></a>, Horace discussed the positioning of the iPhone 5C, how it differed from past years&#8217; portrayal of the &#8220;n-1&#8221; product, and what this means for the iPhone line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This [the iPhone 5C] is where there might be a shift happening. Under the old model the n-1 variant was meant to be a modest volume contributor to the portfolio, being essentially a cognitive illusion which encouraged buyers to stick with iPhone n at the expense of competitors. However, the new n-1 product (the 5C) has a distinct positioning that makes it seem fresh and not a lesser, stale version of the flagship. It is designed to appeal as a legitimate upgrade for iPhone 4/4S users. It is, in other words, not meant as an illusion, and not focusing attention on the flagship<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Rather, it is meant to be a genuine, core product.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the best part of the entire article, though, comes shortly after when Horace explains the implications of this shift in positioning, before he seals the article with a very interesting conclusion.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon Horace posted the next article in the sequence, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/09/11/s-is-for-service/"><em>S is for Service</em></a>. Having discussed positioning in his last article, Horace went on to tackle the ever-present question of why the iPhone costs so much and, in doing so, explain why Apple has refused to enter emerging markets and indirectly answer the question of when Apple will create the &#8220;low end&#8221; offering so many expected the 5C to be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The iPhone could thus be finally understood as a complex service business. It captures value through the phone bill but delivers value through a screen. A misdirection magic trick which many have tried to pull off. It&#8217;s essentially tapping into the $1.3 trillion communications market, skimming profits by delivering the &#8216;content&#8217; which lights up the wires.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s great except it does not work everywhere. Not yet at least. The complexity of services means that they are usually found in more advanced so-called service economies and rare in less developed so-called goods economies.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then in the current final post of his series, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/09/13/m-is-for-mystery/"><em>M is for Mystery</em></a>, Horace conjectured as to the purpose of the M7 motion coprocessor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Hence the question of what is the M7&#8217;s job to be done. As part of an iPhone, it does not seem to have one. Saving a bit of battery life is not a job, and certainly not one that needs to have billing in a media special event. The answer must be that the M7 was developed for some other, as yet unstated reason.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That &#8220;other, as yet unstated reason&#8221;, many have proposed, is the elusive iWatch. That still does not explain the M7&#8217;s existence in the iPhone, however. Fortunately, I do not believe we will have to wait too long to discover its true purpose.</p>

<p>Horace&#8217;s article series has spawned a great deal of intelligent discussion since he published <em>C is for Cognitive Illusion</em> last Wednesday. Most recently, Greg Cox of Expletive Inserted responded to <em>M is for Mystery</em> with an article of his own: <a href="http://expletiveinserted.com/2013/09/13/faith-in-the-job-unknown/"><em>Faith in the Job Unknown</em></a>. Throughout his piece Greg worked to counter the notion that a lack of definition in the jobs to be done of a smart watch in particular, but ultimately any new device, should not&#160;&#8212;&#160;and possibly will not&#160;&#8212;&#160;prevent a company from building such a product.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to spend an hour or two reading this afternoon and want to better understand the tech community&#8217;s continued fascination with Apple, these four articles are a great place to start.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-15 10:09:38-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/15 10:09:38 EST</time>
<p>Far be it from me to step on Horace Dedeiu or Benedict Evan&#8217;s toes in my &#8220;analysis&#8221;, if you could call it that, of this graph Horace posted yesterday, but I do believe it tells us something interesting about how successful Apple believes the iPhone 5C will be.</p>

<p>In previous quarters, as Horace&#8217;s trend shows, the iPhone grew at an increasing rate with each successive launch. That is, Apple&#8217;s device sales did not increase linearly with each new phone, but increased in growth rate upon each release giving a nice, curved ramp in cumulative devices sold. At the far right of this trend we have Tim Cook&#8217;s claim that iPhone shipments will reach 700 million by October, indicating a sharp uptake in iPhone sales from the norm.</p>

<p>The interesting question here is why he expects this jump. Every other year when Apple introduced revolutionary phones, the company forecasted no such spike. So given this, we cannot attribute such a jump to the 5S no matter how great a device. The credit, instead, must go to the 5C, which marked a distinct change in Apple&#8217;s product marketing; no other significant change occurred to which we can attribute this increase.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see the level of faith Tim Cook has in this new device line. Whether that faith will bbe justified, however, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Since its debut yesterday virtually everyone has lauded Apple for introducing the iPhone 5C. (I refuse to acknowledge Apple&#8217;s ridiculous naming convention; 5c? Please. If I wanted to look like a five year old I could forget to proofread my articles on my own. And I&#8217;m not the only one miffed at Apple&#8217;s new standard: Lex Friedman, in a tweet yesterday: &#8220;If Apple is lowercasing the S and C..., I&#8217;m going to start capitalizing the &#8221;i&#8220;: IPhone 5s. That&#8217;s better.&#8221;) Hailed as the elusive midrange offering from a traditionally high-end company, Apple received great praise over a move many see as a way to increase device sales by capturing the low end. I have a number of issues with that sentiment.</p>

<p>In an article from June titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/apples-wildcard.html"><em>Apple&#8217;s Wildcard</em></a>, I questioned the existence of a market Apple could address with a budget iPhone. I reasoned that between latest model, last year&#8217;s offering, and the iPod Touch, no middle ground existed which a cheaper iPhone could occupy. After nearly three more weeks of 5C rumors though, I tempered my initial thoughts in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-halfway-phone.html"><em>The Halfway Phone</em></a>, where instead of denying the existence of such a market, I put forth the hope that Apple would avoid it. Two months later, as I followed along with The Verge&#8217;s live stream of the press event, I was not disappointed when Apple released a marketing gimmick called the IPhone 5c.</p>

<p>Throughout its life in the Apple rumor mill, speculators tried to strike a balance between predicting a phone cheap enough to attract a low end somehow not addressed by Apple&#8217;s existing strategy and imagining a device too expensive to justify its existence alongside the flagship offering. With Apple&#8217;s current portfolio placing the newest model at $650 unsubsidized and $199 on a two-year contract, last year&#8217;s option at $550 and $99 respectively, and the previous year&#8217;s offering on sale for $450 and $0, Apple had two options: price a phone at or around $350 unsubsidized, thereby creating the budget iPhone necessary to enter markets the other models&#8217; price points prohibited, or replace one of its existing tiers. Apple chose the latter route, deigning to give its existing customer base a &#8220;new&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use the word lightly here&#160;&#8212;&#160;option to consider rather than trying to compete on the low-end.</p>

<p>Rather than follow the established trend, wherein Apple shifts its mobile lineup to contain the latest model on top, last year&#8217;s device in the middle, and the year prior&#8217;s phone at the &#8220;low-end&#8221;, Apple chose to make a slight addendum in the form of the 5C. With the 5S marketed as Apple&#8217;s premium offering and the 4S now free with contract, instead of placing the 5 as the midrange offering Apple took that device&#8217;s components, repackaged them in a brightly-colored case, and turned the resulting device into a new category: the &#8220;iPhone 5c [sic]&#8221;. From a technical perspective, the actual product line changed almost imperceptibly with the advent of the &#8220;new&#8221; offering; had Apple forgone the 5C, it would have sold the same three devices, albeit with slightly less color. Not only the same phones from a technical standpoint, but from a pricing one as well: as always, the latest model retails for $649 unsubsidized, and $199 on a two-year contract. The iPhone 5C, replacing the iPhone 5, sells for $549 and $99, respectively, while the 4S comes in at $449 and $0. This should sound familiar; Apple follows this pattern every year, and this year brought no surprises.</p>

<p>Many explain the advent of the 5C as Apple combatting stigma against old phones. As of September twentieth, those purchasing an iPhone but unwilling to pay a premium do not have to settle for last year&#8217;s technology. Or so the reasoning goes, but I can&#8217;t help but consider this, too, a flawed strategy. The first data point in what will likely become a trend shows that with each new model, last year&#8217;s high-end components get repackaged in to that year&#8217;s version of the 5C. Next year, when Apple announces the iPhone 6, the 6C will likely be nothing more interesting than the 5S&#8217;s internals ported to those colorful shells. Some may argue that the 6C will contain lesser versions of the 6&#8217;s components, but that is the very function Apple&#8217;s existing strategy serves. Further, shifting the product line with each successive iPhone launch gives manufacturing setups increased longevity and thus yield greater profits, a benefit this approach would destroy as with each release Apple would be forced to modify its manufacturing process yet again.</p>

<p>If not as a technical boon, a strategy to capture the low end, or a manner through which to combat a perceived stigma against older devices, why did Apple launch the 5C as a new brand? I believe Benedict Evans said it best in <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/377855886594953216">a tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Posit: yesterday Apple cut the price of the iPhone by $100, at same margin, and made it cooler. Also launched entirely new high-end phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Benedict made his point very clear, but for the <a href="http://curiousrat.com/apples-low-cost-fairytale">dimwits</a> I will elaborate. Essentially, and I hinted at this earlier, the 5C is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. After bumping the 5 down a price tier as was expected, Apple simultaneously raised its margins on the device and made it massively more appealing to the mass market. The company will go on to sell <em>droves</em> of this model, and with even greater margins than before, it will make a <em>ton</em> of money.  Therein lies the genius of this approach, and the reason Apple went to all the trouble to create this additional product category. The people who will buy a 5S knew they wanted that phone as soon as Tim Cook announced it; the 5C is decidedly not for them. For everyone else though, those deciding between a 5, 4S, or an Android phone, Apple took away any lingering uncertainty with the 5C.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just before I finished this article, I came across Tom Warren&#8217;s piece on The Verge titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4716286/iphone-5c-not-a-cheap-iphone-just-colorful"><em>The iPhone 5c isn&#8217;t a cheap iPhone, it&#8217;s just a colorful one</em></a> in which he makes most of the same points I did here and a few others to boot. If you found this post at all interesting, I strongly recommend checking his out as well.</p>

<p>In an excellent article posted to The Verge earlier this afternoon Casey Newton made the point I intended to discuss this evening almost as an aside near the end of his article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Apple could also let users log in to other apps and services using a fingerprints, providing secure authentication into apps and websites with a couple of taps. If biometric solutions become widely adopted, the tech industry could begin to phase out&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least augment&#160;&#8212;&#160;the flawed, familiar password.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the advent of Passbook in iOS 6, Apple began handling important personal information such as credit card numbers, boarding passes, and gift cards. A few months ago in June, when  the company announced iCloud Keychain, it expanded that domain to include passwords, but only on the Mac platform. Before too long&#160;&#8212;&#160;hopefully prior to iOS 8&#160;&#8212;&#160;I foresee Apple marrying these two technologies with Touch ID on iOS to give users the ability to not only unlock their phone with a fingerprint, but login to websites and apps with that same technology.</p>

<p>Touch ID in its current form is a technology in its infancy; it will take time before we see the full potential of the groundbreaking feature, and perhaps even longer before we realize it.</p>

<p>With just hours left until the iPhone event today it&#8217;s a little late to speculate on pricing, but I just couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>

<p>Called it. I never believed Apple would create a significantly inexpensive phone, as doing so <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/relegated-to-a-lookalike.html">would segment the market</a> and introduce <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-halfway-phone.html">hallmarks of the Android and Windows worlds</a>. Ben Thompson, speculating on pricing for the iPhone 5S and 5C in his article <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/thinking-about-iphone-pricing/"><em>Thinking about iPhone Pricing</em></a>, backs up my theory:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Given the high bar Apple has set (iPhone 5 technology), I (now) expect the iPhone 5C&#8217;s price to be on the high end of estimates, and possibly higher.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/09/09/thompson">John Gruber, responding to Ben&#8217;s article</a> in agreement, backs up my original idea as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Smart take. The key takeaway: do not expect the iPhone 5C to be cheap or low-cost. It&#8217;s going to be at least $500 unsubsidized, I think. Lower cost, not low cost.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben made a number of great points in his article, accompanied by not quite Asymco-caliber, but nevertheless charming, charts illustrating and further explaining those key concepts. If you read only one more article before the press event, this should be it.</p>

<p>I could write an entire article proposing improvements to the new website alone, let alone the aging app. But this article isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> about Instapaper&#8217;s website, nor is it <em>just</em> about the app; this article is about Instapaper the read it later service and what Betaworks can do to revolutionize this beloved platform upon its next milestone release.</p>

<p>Betaworks acquired Instapaper with its base components&#160;&#8212;&#160;the text parser, server-side processor, and cross-platform syncing engine&#160;&#8212;&#160;intact. Instapaper gained incredible popularity in the first place because of excellence in these three areas. Save for some minor tweaks and optimizations to those existing components then, the significant value Betaworks can add to this platform falls in to two categories: I/O&#160;&#8212;&#160;processes by which users can add and manipulate articles in the service&#160;&#8212;&#160;and presentation of that dateaon Instapaper&#8217;s various supported platforms.</p>

<p>I/O, as per its name, contains within it two subsections: input and output. Instapaper came with a number of suitable input methods including a bookmarklet, the ability to add articles by sending them to a certain email address, and an API for app and web developers to integrate the service into their app, but very few options for outputting content to other services. Especially in recent months with the growing popularity of URL schemes, this shortcoming has been a source of unending frustration on my part.</p>

<p>Beginning with my adoption of Drafts, furthered when I discovered Pythonista, and highlighted by the release of Ole Zorn&#8217;s Editorial, I have drastically changed my workflow over the last month to rely heavily on URL schemes. Meanwhile, Instapaper has remain unchanged and unwavering in its refusal to fit in to my workflow. I would absolutely love to see an Instapaper URL scheme, perhaps closely modeled on Drafts&#8217; own. Instapaper&#8217;s existing support of Drafts, Tweetbot, Simplenote, and Chrome reveal URL scheme integration at a low level for exporting content; I merely ask that Betaworks expose the ability to create custom actions to Instapaper&#8217;s users, and provide for the app to accept input through that avenue as well.</p>

<p>Sticking with improvements to the app itself, I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue against Betaworks refreshing Instapaper&#8217;s design. While not strictly necessary given its coincidental adherence to the new standards put forth in iOS 7, Instapaper would inarguably benefit from some design work.</p>

<p>In the same vein, although certainly more controversial than the last suggestion, I also feel a new&#160;&#8212;&#160;or refreshed, at the very least&#160;&#8212;&#160;icon would greatly benefit the app and the perception of Betaworks as its new owner as well. The current icon is a hallmark of the brand Marco strived so hard to craft with each and every carefully-considered design decision. And while that sentiment of simplicity and ease of use should live on in Betaworks&#8217;s future versions, I would like to see the company take the difficult, inarguably more treacherous road and strike out to destinations previously unconsidered. Changing something so base in the app as its icon would not only signal great changes to come, but also show that&#160;&#8212;&#160;for better or for worse&#160;&#8212;&#160;Instapaper is no longer Marco&#8217;s baby, but the property of Betaworks. Changing the icon would also be a great way for Betaworks to show off its design prowess and quell any lingering uncertainties regarding Instapaper&#8217;s acquisition by not only showing a new icon, but showing off a <em>great</em> new icon.</p>

<p>On the web side of things, I feel Instapaper still needs a lot of work. Even after the recent redesign the new website, while a great improvement over the previous version, still needs a great deal of work. The Instapaper icon, for example, in the top left-hand corner of the screen, currently a whopping 260x140 image, should be much smaller. If Betaworks commissioned a new app icon as I suggested earlier, an element of that size would fit much better in this space.</p>

<p>Further, the interface contains too many scrollbars. As I sit here looking at the webpage, I have a scrollbar in my navigation menu and in the main article list, when in reality I do not need either: if the user navigation section had just fifty pixels left of unused and unnecessary whitespace, that whole section of my screen would appear much more aesthetically pleasing. As for the article list, I only have a single article in my queue at this time; nevertheless, for no apparent reason, it has its own scrollbar.</p>

<p>On the topic of scrollbars, I would also like to suggest some styling: custom scrollbars take a few lines of CSS, work in most major browsers, and would greatly improve the overall look of the interface. As Shawn Blanc famously said, it&#8217;s the little things that count&#160;&#8212;&#160;take delight in the details.</p>

<p>Curiously, instead of living in the sidebar as one might reasonably expect, accessing folders requires the addition of yet another sidebar. Upon clicking the unlabeled button in the top bar, a second sidebar slides in to existence, doubling the space occupied by interface elements of dubious value and significantly decreasing the space left for navigating and interacting with articles. Had this decision been left up to me, I would have moved the folders interface to the original sidebar; at least then it would have merited the scrollbar.</p>

<p>Strangely, with all the time spent creating the main Instapaper website, opening an article replaces every interface element with a much cleaner, much more aesthetically-pleasing design. As an aside, there is curiously no apparent way to return to the main article list from this view save archiving or deleting the article. With the exception of that small oversight though, I couldn&#8217;t help but look around the interface and think, &#8220;This is what the Instapaper website should look like&#8221;: a no-frills, clean reading interface. Instapaper is all about the content, after al, allowing users to bypass the design pitfalls of their favorite websites and just get to the meat of the article. If only Instapaper&#8217;s own website adhered to a similar philosophy.</p>

<p>I titled this article <em>Instapaper 5</em> for a reason: the key to this whole strategy is to reveal all of these changes to the app&#8217;s design, its icon, and the website, along with the significant server-side improvements, all at once in a single grandiose gesture in which Betaworks could make a very impactful statement: this is who Betaworks is, this is the direction we will take Instapaper, and if you had any lingering doubts about our competency, look at this host of massive improvements we have brought you in this short time period. There&#8217;s a reason Apple does not hold an event each time they make a minor improvement to one of their many platforms, but instead bundles all those advances in to one event and says, &#8220;Look at how awesome we are, and look at how great these products are.&#8221; Betaworks has the opportunity to do the same thing with Instapaper 5: improve the app, improve the website, and improve the servers; after that, come out and say, &#8220;Look at how awesome we are, and look at how great this product is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wednesday evening, news broke that Apple had removed The Omni Group&#8217;s iOS app <em>OmniKeyMaster</em> for facilitating upgrade pricing, a feature Apple has refused to build in to the App Store since its launch. Amidst the <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/09/omni-app-store/">vocal</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/on-omnikeymasters-shutdown/">calls</a> for change in Apple&#8217;s long-standing policies, I remembered something Marco Arment said on an episode of <em>Build &#38; Analyze</em>.</p>

<p>During their discussion of apps rejected from the Mac App Store for duplicating existing functionality in the operating system, Marco explained that instead of acting out in justified anger, he accepted the volatility of Apple&#8217;s decisions in the app space as the price of doing business. If Instapaper ever encountered such problems, or a patent troll decided to sue him, Marco&#8217;s solution was to move on and build another app instead of spending valuable time and resources fighting an uphill battle, and especially one in which he had little chance of winning.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-06 15:58:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/06 15:58:51 EST</time>
<p>After nearly six years of Windows XP, the tenth major version of Microsoft&#8217;s computer operating system released to much hype and high expectations. With an overhauled visual aesthetic and a host of other headlining features, the Windows world heralded this release as the platform atop which the next generation of computers would build itself. An ambitious claim for sure, Microsoft&#8217;s promise to not only overhaul the user interface but its very underpinnings as well seemed almost too good to be true. After XP&#8217;s phenomenal success though, the claim seemed a believable one. Like a joke straight out of Family Guy, Vista exited the gate and promptly fell flat on its face.</p>

<p>Plagued with security issues, interface flaws, and general instability, Windows Vista became the industry&#8217;s cautionary tale, the butt of all too many jokes for quite some time. Microsoft had promised a revolutionary new aesthetic and a complete overhaul of the operating system down to its core, and then released what many considered a half-baked product. On the whole visually attractive, I must admit, but significantly flawed nonetheless.</p>

<p>In less than a week Apple will hold a press event at which the company will, presumably, announce two new versions of their flagship product, the iPhone 5S and 5C, along with a host of updates to its existing offerings. Additionally, many believe Apple will also show off the final version of iOS 7 to hit the market in conjunction with the aforementioned iPhone models. With a completely revamped user interface and rebuilt core, iOS 7 has generated an enormous amount of excitement since Tim Cook demoed the update at WWDC three months ago; it will undoubtedly launch to a great deal of hype and high expectations.</p>

<p>Sound at all familiar?</p>

<p>Microsoft began developing the operating system that eventually evolved in to Windows Vista three months prior to XP&#8217;s release. Talk about on the ball. However, after many delays and concerned with the omnipresent issue of feature creep, the Windows team scrapped the codebase and started anew in the second half of 2004. Over the next three years, Microsoft went on to create what was intended as a paradigm-shifting platform.</p>

<p>Fast-forward nine years and Apple just finished previewing the next major release of their mobile operating system, iOS 7. Like Microsoft, Apple promised a beautiful new interface and revamped underpinnings; unlike Microsoft, Apple has three months to deliver on that promise. Granted, work on iOS 7 likely began soon after iOS 6 hit the market, but the iOS 7 previewed at WWDC 2013 and the version in development before Scott Forstall was ousted in October of 2012 were likely radically different offerings. Some of that work undoubtedly carried over, but certainly not all of it. In essence, Apple had just over ten months to revolutionize their mobile operating system.</p>

<p>I have great faith in Apple&#8217;s engineering team; the &#8220;It just works&#8221; slogan didn&#8217;t stick for nothing, after all, it came as a result of incredibly hard work and dedication. But while I do believe Apple is capable of pulling this off, the chance of a Windows Vista-like release is at least an interesting possibility to consider.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the danger of bluffing in anything&#160;&#8212;&#160;you better be 100% certain you aren&#8217;t called, or willing to take the risk you are. I think it is clear this was a bluff on Obama&#8217;s part. Right or wrong Obama has now been called. There is very little choice for the United States now&#160;&#8212;&#160;because either hard line statements from our President no longer carry weight, or we go to war (of some scale).&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked forward to hearing Ben Brooks&#8217; thoughts on this topic all throughout the process of writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/syrian-waves.html"><em>Syrian Waves</em></a>; he didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-09-02 18:24:08-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-09.html">09</a>/02 18:24:08 EST</time>
<p>Shortly after Downton Abbey&#8217;s third season ended, iTV announced a fourth set for the latter-half of this year. Even as an ardent fan of the British television programme, I paid little attention to the announcement and any ensuing chatter until, presently, it faded from my mind entirely.</p>

<p>Over the past week or two, enthusiasm has continued to grow as we come closer and closer to the stated release date. Instead of excitement, however, as I was want to feel, I couldn&#8217;t help but read the occasional article and watch the trailer with a tinge of apprehension, bordering on disappointment. Not that the show was back after almost a year hiatus, but that it was back after such a great ending.</p>

<p>For those possessing poor memories, season three ended with a cricket match between the abbey household and the villagers. Specifically, the very last scene&#160;&#8212;&#160;still etched in my memory&#160;&#8212;&#160;came to a close with Lord Grantham, Mathew Crawley, and Tom Branson shaking hands on the cricket field. Mathew had found some middle ground between the white-collar lawyer he had started as and the Earl Lord Grantham sought to turn him in to earlier in the season; Lord Grantham, similarly, had met Mathew halfway. Perhaps more significantly though, Lord Grantham had come to accept Tom as a member of his household rather than the lowly driver. Tom had grown as well: although still fiercely independent and politically-minded, Tom had mellowed following Sybil&#8217;s death and the birth of his daughter.</p>

<p>All in all I could not have been happier with the ending; to call it excellent would not do those final moments justice. Sure, it left some plot avenues unexplored, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;as I discussed in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-beauty-of-a-limited-run.html"><em>The Beauty of a Limited Run</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;that&#8217;s the hallmark of an excellent show. Not exhausting every single possibility leaves viewers something to think about, something to wish they had seen. Julian Fellowes ended season three spectacularly, to say the least. And now, with season four, she will have to top that. I&#8217;m confident that she can, but I would have been just as happy had she let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

<p>Of the few topics I consistently refrain from writing about, I most actively avoid religion and politics. Not because I hesitate to post anything inflammatory or fear alienating potential readers, but more so because I do not know enough about either topic to write with any valid authority. That list used to include Apple rumors and speculation, but the last few weeks have seen me gradually enter that front as well. Today, I expand my topic list once again to include politics.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago, President Obama gave a speech in which he spoke of a &#8220;red-line&#8221; in reference to the then-year-long Syria conflict which, if crossed, would result in severe penalties to President Bashar al-Assad. That red line was the use of chemical weapons, and crossing it meant America entering the fray with decisive military force.</p>

<p>Despite President Obama&#8217;s explicit condemnation of chemical and biological weapons, made with the support of many other world leaders, Assad deigned to disregard the warning and massacre nearly 1,500 people just over a week ago, many of them children, using these forbidden weapons. The die had been cast, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the news broke, articles and pictures began surfacing. Rows upon rows of bodies lined dusty floors. Doctors and volunteers crowded around ashen faces with unfocusing, vacant eyes. The death toll continued to climb. As of today, that number resides close to one thousand five hundred dead, a significant potion of which were children, innocents caught in the crossfire.</p>

<p>On the other side of Europe, Prime Minister David Cameron set the wheels of government turning by recalling members of the House of Commons early and proposing a joint strike against Assad&#8217;s regime. In a vote that took the world by surprise, the House decided against supporting the zero-tolerance resolution against chemical weapons in Syria; Britain would not join America in holding Assad responsible for his crimes against humanity; Britain would not join America in striking Syria.</p>

<p>Across the Atlantic Ocean, Obama stepped up to a podium, a prepared speech at the ready. America, too, would not honor its pledge of affirmative action&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least, not yet: under the guise of offering the &#8220;war-weary&#8221; public a say in the matter, Obama schluffed the potentially unpopular decision off to Congress. Halfway across the world, Syrians almost universally lost faith in the West.</p>

<p>Unlike President Obama, we would be wrong to fault Britain&#8217;s Prime Minister for failing to deliver on his pledge. Cameron does not possess the same power Obama does, after all; his hands were tied. Obama, on the other hand, as Commander in Chief of the most powerful military force in existence, with the authority granted him by the Constitution of the United States of America, not only had the authority to order a strike on Syria, but the moral obligation as well. In what I can see as nothing other than a deplorable attempt at avoiding the unwarranted criticism George Bush received for declaring war on Iraq after 9/11, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power, balked when it came time to fulfill the promise he apparently errantly made on August twentieth of last year. Instead of fulfilling his duty, Obama passed it off to a group of legislators on vacation for the weekend. When those upper echelons of society finally do return from their barbecues and beach trips, I can only hope they possess the resolve, conviction, and compassion to make the decision our president should have made more than a week ago.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, protestors will march and chant against American intervention, preferring the wholesale demise of the weak and helpless to a few tons of bombs. Unfortunately, I cannot say I disagree with them in every regard: to those objecting to the strike as a prelude to the eventual occupation of Syria not unlike the United States now and will indefinitely occupy Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, I must agree: any military action on our part is extremely unlikely to end when the bombers drop their payloads. But to them I must also pose this question: at what loss of life must we preserve this high-brow moralism, this aversion to dictating the affairs of unstable dictatorships without respect for human life? That is the real question here, hyperbole aside.</p>

<p>Admittedly less important but nevertheless of great significance is the alteration in perception this affair will cause between America and the world. Regardless of whether you hold a picket sign outside the White House, dismiss the picketers as foolish, or adjust your armchair in preparation for a long-winded comment on CNN.com, you cannot argue Obama&#8217;s pledge-then-renege strategy will to some degree adversely effect the world&#8217;s opinion of the American Government&#8217;s commitment to its promises. If the American people take a pledge of support to a people facing rodent-like extermination so lightly, what else will they fall short on?</p>

<p>Perhaps of even greater import in the corridors of power, however, is the precedent this resolution sets. By seeking Congress&#8217;s approval, President Obama has taken an Executive decision and moved it to the Legislative branch in the name of giving &#8220;the people&#8221; a voice through their representatives. Now what will he do next month or next year when faced with a similar decision of whether or not to take military action: will he once again ask &#8220;the people&#8221; for approval, or disregard their wishes&#160;&#8212;&#160;for that is the sole alternative&#160;&#8212;&#160;and make the choice himself? Having framed this significant decision as one he will make with the public&#8217;s input, the implication being that had he made the choice, as was his right, he would have disregarded their opinions, I foresee a future in which many presidential decisions becomes less about the actual issue and more about whether he or she cares what the masses think. And that is a scary future indeed.</p>

<p>Throughout this piece I have tried, admittedly less-successfully in subsequent revisions, to keep my own biases and opinions out of the equation. I attempted to write based solely on the facts and using simple cause and effect analysis to prove my points, while channeling voice and passion in to the words themselves rather than rash outbursts and inappropriate characterizations. The issues really are simple, after all, black and white. If only the decisions could follow suit.</p>

<p>In an uncharacteristically long post from The Loop titled <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/08/23/the-state-of-apples-tv-quest/"><em>The state of Apple&#8217;s TV quest</em></a>, Dave Mark made an interesting observation regarding Apple&#8217;s alleged impending entrance in to the television industry. The pertinent sentence&#160;&#8212;&#160;cited below&#160;&#8212;&#160;draws a parallel between the music industry prior to the introduction of iTunes and the television industry of today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Just as happened in the music space, companies like Apple act as a disruption to an existing business model.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Apple TV is the iPod of 2001; combined with the iTunes Store and Apple&#8217;s plans for television, I predict we will see a revolution of the television space in the very near future not unlike the one that took place circa 2001 when Apple took the music industry by storm. So rather than repeatedly posing the inane question of whether this revolution will take place or not, let us conjecture as to what it will look like when it does.</p>

<p>In the recent past, Apple has come out with two services I consider indicative of its burgeoning television strategy: iTunes Match and iTunes Radio.</p>

<p>With iTunes Match, in return for a nominal annual fee Apple gives its subscribers the ability to replace existing audio files with high-quality versions, back up their entire music library, and access that collection from a wide range of devices. A strategy derived from this portfolio could simultaneously obviate the existing market for time-shifting television viewing and greatly improve it as well. Not to discount the significance of this innovation, but even more interesting than a superior DVR service is the possibility of universal access to television content this strategy could enable, much like the cross-device access iTunes Match makes possible for music. I would love to see Apple push Time Warner Cable and HBO&#8217;s apps out of the market, their services no longer necessary in world where watching <em>Suits</em> proves no more difficult on my iPad than on the big screen in front of the couch.</p>

<p>In addition to the innovations Apple could make in the delivery of television content, iTunes Radio could indicate a possible innovation in its presentation as well. Based on the brief preview at WWDC, an iTunes Radio-like TV service may offer an ad-free tier for those willing to pay a premium. And since I&#8217;m already flying in the face of everything the television industry stands for, let me offer up another possibility: an a la carte program offering.</p>

<p>While you reel, let&#8217;s take a step back and look at the current lifecycle of a television series.</p>

<p>Sons of Anarchy premiered in September of 2008. Just shy of a year later, the entire first season came out on DVD for somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 based on the selling price of the current season. Over the life of that season, then, the producers received ad revenue during its initial run, and then $40 for every superfan who purchased the box set. On a viewer-by-viewer basis, I find it extremely hard to believe that ad sales generated more revenue than sales of the box set. Operating under that assumption, it follows that a great way to generate more revenue per viewer would be to somehow incentivize each of them to shell out $40 for the season.</p>

<p>Enter Apple. For a yearly fee&#160;&#8212;&#160;certainly greater than iTunes Match&#8217;s $25, but likely less than the exorbitant cable rates&#160;&#8212;&#160;subscribers gain access to a decentralized, premiere television experience. Depending on the selected tier, subscribers may or may not be subjected to intrusive ads. Offering two tiers would keep the existing ad model intact as a certain subset of users opt for the cheaper, ad-infused experience as was the case with the ad-supported Kindle device, while simultaneously satisfying the users willing to pay more for an improved experience with the added benefit of zero ads.</p>

<p>The chosen tier would also effect the price for channel and show subscriptions, which could range from relatively cheap for popular channels to more expensive for shows traditionally not available in America, for example. Subscribing to an individual show may also offer additional advantages such as immediate availability similar to Netflix&#8217;s <em>House of Cards</em>. With enough incentives, Apple could easily entice both casual viewers and superfans to shell out an extra lump sum for <em>Downton Abbey</em>&#8216;s latest season, boosting the producers&#8217; revenues by striking the balance between the millions of viewers who watch ad-supported television and the hundreds of thousands&#160;&#8212;&#160;if even that&#160;&#8212;&#160;who purchase box sets months after the final episode airs. Skewing the incentives too heavily toward individual show subscriptions could prove problematic as the a la carte model&#8217;s detractors often point out, but I am confident that Apple could strike this balance with relative ease.</p>

<p>Unlike most television theories concerning Apple, this one requires no iTV or dedicated hardware other than the preexisting Apple TV. Yet despite its modest hardware requirements, it possesses the potential to turn the television industry on its head. The infrastructure is already in place; the only hurdles remaining are shrewd deals and large cash expenditures, neither of which have proved particularly difficult for Apple in the past.</p>

<p>On a recent episode of what I believe was Back to Work, Dan and Merlin mentioned in passing a great page on the MacRumors website offering buying advice for Apple products. Based on average product cycles and current rumors, the editors at MacRumors decide whether to give the green-light to purchasing a new Apple device, whether to caution against it in the case of a yellow light, or give a product the red light signifying their advice against purchasing it at this time. Even for those steeped in the Apple community and familiar with all the current rumors, this page is nice to keep around if you ever lose track of whether or not now is a good time to buy a new MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering Huangshan&#8217;s extreme beauty, it&#8217;s not surprising that the area derives much of its significance from Chinese art and literature. It has inspired poets such as Li Bai, many Chinese ink paintings, and more recently, photography. According to Wikipedia, over 20,000 poems were written about the mountains between the Tang Dynasty (618-906) and the end of the Qing Dynasty (1614 to 1911). They&#8217;ve also inspired modern works, lending to the fictional world designed for James Cameron&#8217;s 2009 film Avatar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing such majestic scenery as this mountain range is so common in many of today&#8217;s movies and TV shows, yet it takes an article like this to realize that such places do actually exist in the real world.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a great movie to be made about the life of Steve Jobs, but Jobs is not it. The primary challenge in making a film about the co-founder of Apple is finding an actor who can play an overtly cerebral, egomaniacal dick, but a dick for whom you want to root. Besides a striking resemblance to the young Steve Jobs, Ashton Kutcher is a terrible choice: There&#8217;s nothing about his character that makes you want to root for him, and all of his attempts to depict Jobs as a dick are layered in frat-boy douchebaggery.&#8221;</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t seen <em>Jobs</em> yet, but I absolutely love everything about this review, from the title to the closing paragraph. Easily one of the best articles I have read in quite some time.</p>

<p>Although the first movie adaptation of Christopher Paolini&#8217;s <em>Eragon</em> could have passed as a mildly successful yet unremarkable summer movie, it falls far short when compared to the original series from which it borrowed little besides character names and basic plotlines, only to discard the latter whenever the &#8220;director&#8221; deemed it convenient. Anyone who has ever seen a book-turned-movie undoubtedly read that without any surprise; the book invariable proves better than the movie, or so that adage goes, and there are countless examples supporting the phrase in just the last year alone.</p>

<p>I read <em>The Hunger Games</em> at sixteen driving through Mozambique. For better or worse I spent more time staring at those pages than looking at the country passing by the windows. Yet when <em>The Hunger Games</em> came out on DVD, I pushed turned off the credits with considerable less satisfaction than I had upon closing the last page of Suzanne Collins&#8217;s novel.</p>

<p>When Cassandra Clare announced an upcoming movie based on her <em>Mortal Instruments</em> books, I looked forward to finally seeing Clary and Jace team up against a world of demons and monsters hidden from my point of view. And then the trailers came out, and my excitement evaporated in less time than it took to buffer those gaudy videos: Jace looks more like the lead of a boyband on its downward spiral than a force to be reckoned with, and Lily Collins just isn&#8217;t Clary. I hope <em>The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</em> proves me wrong, but I don&#8217;t consider it particularly likely.</p>

<p>And the list goes on and on. And on.</p>

<p>In each case, I walked in to the theater or sat down on my couch with a vision&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether I recognized it as such or not&#160;&#8212;&#160;of what the characters should look like and how the movie ought to progress. Sometimes, those were not unrealistic expectations: I expected Capricorn to radiate evil rather than make jokes about duct tape in <em>Inkheart</em>, and I could not have been faulted for that; in others, however, I had less likely expectations: perhaps I was wrong to count on Gary Ross to place more focus on Katniss Everdeen the awe-inspiring figure of rebellion instead of the arguably more impactful portrayal of a scared teenager staring almost certain death in the face. Irregardless of how likely or not my expectations were though, I nevertheless formed them, and in each case the movie failed to meet them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as demonstrated by Walter Isaacson&#8217;s biography of Steve Jobs, the film industry is not the only one in which reality flies in the face of reasonable expectations. We as a community possess a glorious picture of what a Steve Jobs biography and a Steve Jobs movie should look like. And unfortunately, whatever we see&#160;&#8212;&#160;regardless of how good&#160;&#8212;&#160;will invariable fall short of those expectations and thus fail in our minds. That&#8217;s not to say that a perfect biography would sanctify Apple&#8217;s former CEO, that a more technically-minded writer should have written the Steve Jobs biography, or a less-foolish actor should have starred in <em>Jobs</em>, but take a step back and ask yourself this: would it have changed anything?</p>

<p>Whereas Matt appears to perhaps unintentionally relegate his condemnation to those producing poorly-formed written work for public consumption, I would take his advice one step further and apply it to every single written sentence, whether that fragment of prose is something so innocuous as a text message or important as a book. Regardless of the medium, there exists no suitable excuse for degrading the writers&#8217; craft with poor work.</p>

<p>&#8220;All we can really gleam from this new footage is this: Thor has a problem. Loki has some knowledge of how to fix that problem. The two team up. After that, it&#8217;s all Thor swaggering, Loki sneering, and the two doing a whole bunch of fantasy-themed ass-kicking.&#8221;</p>

<p>What more do we need? I, for one, am <em>extremely</em> excited to see this movie come November. The first fell short in many, many areas, but after The Avengers and its phenomenal success I have high hopes for this sequel.</p>

<p>With the beta release of Instapaper&#8217;s newly overhauled and undeniably much more attractive website, we are finally beginning to see some of the great new features Marco sold Instapaper to Betaworks for. As I said in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/what-happened-to-instapaper.html"><em>What Happened to Instapaper?</em></a>, I&#8217;m very excited to see where the company takes Instapaper in the near future. A new website was a wonderful place to begin.</p>

<p>And for those thinking Betaworks has sat on their hands for the last four months, Marco Arment dispels that notion in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/08/09/instapaper-design-beta">his blog post responding to the announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Betaworks has only owned Instapaper for a few months so far, and they&#8217;ve already hired a staff, moved the entire infrastructure to AWS, improved support, rewritten much of the back end, and overhauled the website design.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very promising start. Next up: a new version of Instapaper for iOS, likely to be released around the same time iOS 7 hits the market.</p>

<p>I devoted <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-september-iphone-launch.html">my last post</a> to discussing Ina Fried&#8217;s prediction of a September 10th iPhone launch date, forgoing my thoughts on the article itself and its rise to popularity over the last twenty-four hours. From my opening paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Earlier this morning, as I scrolled through my RSS reader, I came across a number of articles mentioning an unassuming and altogether unremarkable <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130810/circle-sept-10-on-your-calendar-for-apples-big-iphone-event/">AllThingsD piece by Ina Fried</a>. Despite its lukewarm tone, the prediction of a September iPhone launch event ran the gamut of popular tech sites and garnered a great deal of attention even though it said nothing surprising or even particularly interesting at this point.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I intend to expand upon that overarching sentiment of disappointment.</p>

<p>As near as I can tell, it appears the hullabaloo that rose up around Ina&#8217;s article stemmed from her information purportedly coming from a source within the company, or so her article seemed to imply. That, and the fact that the notable(?) site AllThingsD published the rumor.</p>

<p>And I consider that fundamentally wrong. As I said in <em>The September iPhone Launch</em>&#8217;s opening paragraph cited above, Ina neither made any surprising nor interesting observations&#160;&#8212;&#160;let alone predictions&#160;&#8212;&#160;as to the future with the minor exception of a concrete launch date. But as I demonstrated later on in my article, even deducing that date proved of little difficulty; no harder than tacking on &#8220;...sources told AllThingsD&#8221; anyways. But yet GigaOM, TechCrunch, Macstories, and other well-known internet publications picked it up, branded it with their stamp of approval, and passed it along. It&#8217;s disappointing, really: both the article itself and the fact that so many deemed it worthy to pass along in such high regard.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning, as I scrolled through my RSS reader, I came across a number of articles mentioning an unassuming and altogether unremarkable <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130810/circle-sept-10-on-your-calendar-for-apples-big-iphone-event/">AllThingsD piece by Ina Fried</a>. Despite its lukewarm tone, the prediction of a September iPhone launch event ran the gamut of popular tech sites and garnered a great deal of attention even though it said nothing surprising or even particularly interesting at this point. Setting that aside for a future article though, I would like to focus on the rumor itself.</p>

<p>Discerning the likelihood of a September launch event is no more complicated than observing Apple&#8217;s somewhat established track record. Beginning with the first iPhone in June of 2007, Apple went on to deliver further iterations in July, June, and then June once again before moving to a later launch date of October and, most recently, September. This portion of the rumor seems like a no-brainer: after gradually pushing iPhone launch dates further back each year and now abutting the holiday season, it seems unlikely that Apple will continue shifting the launch date significantly. That specific date, on the other hand, and the manner through which Ina Fried could have deduced it remains a mystery to me. Once again pointing back to the past, Apple released the last two iPhones on a Friday; AllThingsDo, however, reports a launch on Tuesday. Both iOS 5 and iOS 6 hit the market on a Wednesday. If I had to guess&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this far in to this article, I do&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would place my money on either Thursday or Friday, September 12th or 13th.</p>

<p>Every time someone publishes an article confirming or in some way adding to the discussion surrounding a rumor, and every time I or another writer picks it apart in minute detail, I chuckle to myself. But that&#8217;s what so much of this industry is based upon: minute details upon which one platform or product can differentiate itself.</p>

<p>Last night I posted a link to John Gruber&#8217;s commentary of MG Siegler&#8217;s article cited above. I found Gruber&#8217;s realization that rather than a floundering monolith Amazon is instead a flourishing innovator pouring almost the entirety of its profits back in to the very ecosystem responsible for creating that revenue in the first place a very interesting one, especially given Mathew Alexander&#8217;s similar sentiment expressed on a past episode of his podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/bionic">Bionic</a>.</p>

<p>Today I got around to reading the original piece from MG Siegler, and I couldn&#8217;t agree with Gruber more: it&#8217;s a wonderful article well worth the read, especially for those who do not fully understand Amazon and the Apple community&#8217;s continued fascination with the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ability to disable Control Center while using apps. The feature previously worked no matter where you were in iOS 7. Now you can select to have it turned off whenever an app is open. It can also be disabled on the lock screen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately upon reading this it struck me how very strange it is for Apple, notorious for choosing the one experience it considers best and enforcing it with a hard and unyielding hand, to give its users control over such a major feature in iOS 7. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the setting gone by the next beta release.</p>

<p>Bitsplitting has been and remains my single favorite interview podcast. One hundred episodes of Hypercritical exposed me to fields of knowledge I otherwise would never have come across, but it took a different kind of show to really acquaint me with the internet&#8217;s favorite critic. Although I would not go so far as to presume to know John Siracusa, Bitsplitting gave me wonderful insight into the man behind the curtain not only for Hypercritical, but many other podcasts as well. This hiatus will serve as a great opportunity for new listeners to catch up on the first season before Daniel Jalkut picks back up again, hopefully in the near future. Go check it out; I promise you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>

As is often the case, inspiration for the title and accompanying article came at quite the inopportune moment: just after I had started shaving. Nevertheless, I captured both and began writing intending to bemoan the fact that over the last three months or thereabouts, I had failed to produce a respectable number of substantial articles. Attributing this lack of prolificacy to my job, I planned to write about how posting linked list items kept writing at the forefront of my mind, and how these types of articles often served as the gateway drug, if you will, to the long-form pieces I wrote in the evenings and on weekends.</p>

<p>I got through the first paragraph, right up to the point where I planned to list the disparagingly few original works I had produced, when I realized that I was wrong: over the summer, I had written quite a bit. And most importantly, I still feel great pride towards almost every one of those articles.</p>

<p>That is the realization I wish to leave with you, aspiring writer: sometimes it will appear as if you have written very few articles, and of those articles a dispiriting few merit any pride. But take a step back and get out of your own head: chances are, you will have written more than you previously thought, and I&#8217;m willing to bet that those articles aren&#8217;t quite as bad as you think.</p>

<p>John Gruber, commenting on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/05/bezos-not-bozos/">MG&#8217;s article</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;ve harped on Amazon&#8217;s seemingly eternal lack of profitability as much as anyone, but when you think about it and study their business, it&#8217;s not that they can&#8217;t turn a profit. They&#8217;re not burning through money like they were in the go-go &#8217;90s. They simply choose not to turn a profit, and instead invest everything in operations and low prices.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mathew Alexander of <a href="http://one37.net/">One37.net</a> and the popular podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/bionic">Bionic</a>, in an episode from quite some time ago, made a similar point responding to the hyperbole following an Amazon earnings announcement painting the company as an unprofitable and therefore doomed company. Flying in the face of the familiar rhetoric the Apple community almost univocally spouts, the notion that instead of simply being unable to make money Amazon instead pours almost all of its profits back in to the very ecosystem that created it in the first place rather than saving those funds for a rainy day as Apple does is a very interesting&#160;&#8212;&#160;and apparently novel&#160;&#8212;&#160;way to think of the company, and one that lends a great deal of credence to the notion of Amazon emerging as a major player in the tech sector sometime in the near future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Randall Munroe&#8217;s web comic XKCD has long been known for pushing boundaries in strange ways, but his latest experiment topped them all. Over the course of four months, &#8221;Time&#8220; grew as a frame was added every 30 minutes or so, ending up with over 3,000 individual frames by the time it wrapped up earlier this week.&#8221;</p>

<p>I absolutely love XKCD. I have read every one of Randall Munroe&#8217;s 1246 comics, and <em>Time</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;which you can watch in its entirety over at <a href="http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/">Aubron Wood</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;is one of my favorites. I plan to read the next 1246 strips as well; I suggest you do the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the very reason Android has no Gruber-like figure - they have no central philosophy that would allow such a figure to emerge. What would the Android Gruber write about? There are of course Android writers out there, but they mostly cover the latest greatest phone or compare feature sets. They never really put things into context with the overall philosophy of the platform like Gruber does with Apple, because there is no overall philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>An interesting article to be sure, but I can&#8217;t quite say I agree with him: I subscribe to Daring Fireball&#8217;s RSS feed because I enjoy the occasional snarky comment Gruber tacks on to his articles and because his site is a great place to discover trending topics in the Apple world. To date, I can&#8217;t say I have ever read a single one of his long-form articles, so to say that the reason I read his site is for pieces that &#8220;put things into context with the overall philosophy of the platform&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth: I would still subscribe to his site if he wrote about Android, so long as this Gruber-like figure did his job well and with an attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has nothing to do with politics, or gender. I know women who have been threated physically because of their thoughts on real-time strategy games. I knew men who had their spouses and children threatened, or had racial or sexual harassment thrown their way, because of review scores. This isn&#8217;t new. This isn&#8217;t rare. And it&#8217;s not something anyone can easily ignore, or something they should expected to endure silently and gracefully.&#8221; - Ben Kuchera for Penny Arcade in <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/swimming-in-a-sea-of-shit-the-internets-war-against-creatives">Swimming in a sea of shit</a></p>

<p>A few weeks ago a retired Navy friend of mine said something that struck me hard at the time, but particularly forcefully as I sat digesting the article cited above from Penny Arcade: &#8220;Guys don&#8217;t beat their wives because of PTSD; it&#8217;s a real thing, I promise you that, but that isn&#8217;t why they beat them. They beat their wives because they&#8217;re low-life scumbags.&#8221; Addendum mine: but they still blame PTSD.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t go so far as to compare mental abuse incurred on the internet to physical abuse in the home, but I will pose this question: how is the Twitter user threatening to commit heinous acts justifying his&#160;&#8212;&#160;or her, let me be explicitly gender-normative here lest I incur the extremists&#8217;s rage&#160;&#8212;&#160;actions with the modification of <em>a gun</em> in <em>a game</em> any different than the scumbag who goes home and knocks his wife around in the evenings? Sure, one is <em>merely</em> threatening while the other actually injures, but if that&#8217;s the only differentiation you can make, well, that right there is the problem itself.</p>

<p>Both Burn Notice and NCIS, arguably two of USA Network&#8217;s most popular television broadcasts, adhere to a strict rule set in each and every episode: a sailor dies, the NCIS team responds and eventually solves the case, and in the last few minutes the overarching story progresses ever so slightly. Similarly, Burn Notice opens with the client, someone with a problem that Michael will agree to solve after a varying amount of reluctance, and closes with the minute progression of a larger plot just as NCIS does. Although I have only occasionally seen other installments of USA&#8217;s programs, shows like Psych and to a lesser degree Covert Affairs follow the same basic outline.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum we have shows like USA&#8217;s Suits and HBO&#8217;s House of Cards, both extremely popular programs that conduct themselves in a very different way, with each installment furthering the single plot line NCIS and Burn Notice devote such an unfortunately small amount of time to. That&#8217;s to say nothing for the insanely popular Game of Thrones, which follows the latter&#8217;s model rather than the former&#8217;s to great success.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer grand stories featuring complex plot lines and deep characters played out over a great number of episodes rather than much smaller, simple narratives stretched out and then jammed in to the tail end of a similar time frame. Shows of this nature are very similar to movies, which is part of the reason I enjoy them so much, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would wager&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of the many reasons shows like <em>Suits</em> achieve such success on TV.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-07-22 18:39:29-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-07.html">07</a>/22 18:39:29 EST</time>
<p>Just over two short weeks in to the new year, Casey Liss, former <em>Build &#38; Analyze</em> host Marco Arment, and former <em>Hypercritical</em> host John Siracusa released a casual car podcast aptly dubbed <em>Neutral</em>. The show went on to received critical acclaim not only for its fantastic roster, but for its role pioneering a new show format in the podcasting space as well. Finishing in just twelve short episodes, <em>Neutral</em> and its hosts proved not only the the viability of a limited run in podcasting, but its worth as well.</p>

<p>To a lesser degree, John Siracusa had already realized the idea&#8217;s value in ending his own show after one hundred episodes, a move he made in an attempt at staying the slip into mediocrity Marco reportedly experienced with his own podcast; however, the limited run did not gain widespread traction, neither after <em>Hypercritical</em> nor <em>Neutral</em>&#8217;s premature demise. Instead, a mantra carried over from the broadcast television industry persevered, teaching producers to extract the most value possible by continuing production long after a show had reached the ignominious point of mediocrity John avoided when he ended <em>Hypercritical</em>.</p>

<p>Curiously, that notion neither permeates the entire television industry, nor even the entirety of each genre. The vast majority of anime programs, for example, run for only twenty-four episodes. Forsaking that, some consist of fifty episodes, beyond which the <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, and <em>Naruto</em> franchises reside in another category all to themselves. A category not dissimilar from that of most American television series, in fact, which often number in the hundreds of episodes.</p>

<p>Take USA Network&#8217;s <em>Burn Notice</em>, for example: currently in its seventh season, the show will grow to encompass more than one hundred episodes and a movie before ending. One hundred episodes roughly forty-five minutes long that should have ended quite some time ago. That&#8217;s not to characterize the current season as disappointing, merely to say that the show could have aired in fewer, more concise, gripping, action-packed episodes without weakening the franchise in the least. In fact, such a move would have bolstered the series, making the show much more enjoyable in the aggregate. Free of the need to prolong the relatively basic storyline, a much more limited run would have done to <em>Burn Notice</em> what it did to <em>Neutral</em>: keep the show focused and on-topic, giving its creators no room to deviate in to the uninteresting avenues so deplorably present throughout USA&#8217;s hit show.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, milking any series with even the slightest hint of success in an attempt at extracting every last cent is an all too common occurrence in the television industry in those unwilling to not even take a leap of faith but simply approach show production with an open mind. Fortunately for us though, although not as much for its fans, we can find one example of a limited run in a mainstream broadcast, from which we can derive some interesting conclusions: Fox&#8217;s Firefly.</p>

<p>Firefly ran for eleven episodes before Fox canceled it short of the scheduled fourteen likely comprising the first of many seasons, and people <em>still</em> talk about it in a mixture of awe and reverence as if it were God&#8217;s gift to mankind. Although I do not hold it on such a high pedestal as others I can, however, appreciate the reasons many people do. But how many of those reasons are the result of the show itself&#160;&#8212;&#160;excellent writing, strong acting, and solid directing, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;rather than the by-product of a rarely-seen occurrence in the mainstream television industry, even if a forced one? Plot lines left untouched, adventures unexplored, mysterious characters, unexplained back stories&#160;&#8212;&#160;these all result from a show that ended before every possible avenue was not only explored but done so exhaustively and in excruciating detail. In other words, a show that was either canceled, or underwent production for a limited run.</p>

<p>Someday I look forward to seeing the Apple of television studios appear on the scene. If not this year or next, maybe in five or ten; hopefully not too much longer though. I want to see this studio make the choices consumers don&#8217;t yet know they want to see enacted, the tough choices that seem counterintuitive at first glance, but implement to fantastic results even if they go unnoticed at first. Then I want that studio to stick with those decisions until the rest of the industry catches up, not unlike Apple has done in many ways throughout its history. Hopefully, one of those decisions will mandate an end to the established model and usher in a new era; an era of quality shows not beholden to the existing mantra. And maybe, just maybe, one of those tough decisions, the one that neither consumers nor productions houses have come to terms with yet, will be to create a show designed to run for a limited time from the start.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-07-21 12:42:32-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-07.html">07</a>/21 12:42:32 EST</time>
<p>Last month, in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/apples-wildcard.html"><em>Apple&#8217;s Wildcard</em></a>, I predicted Tim Cook announcing an iPhone 5S rather than an iPhone 6 this fall, pointing to the 3G and 3GS, 4 and 4S models as proof. I did, however, hedge my bets with Tim Cook&#8217;s &#8220;Can&#8217;t innovate, my ass&#8221; comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What if Tim Cook just really, <em>really</em> wanted to give all the people who wrote stories about innovation being dead at Apple, all the Apple pundits and haters, and maybe Samsung in particular, a big FU and release another major update to their flagship product just six months after its debut? It&#8217;s a long show, I know, but Apple under Tim Cook is a very different Apple than under Steve Jobs, and Tim Cook&#8217;s Apple might just do it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I wrote that post, I envisioned the 5S in the same form factor as the 5 but with the characteristic component upgrade, whereas an iPhone 6 would simply feature a more drastic performance bump. Even in my wildest dreams I did not envision something so wonderfully different as the iPhone 6 concept that popped up on the Hacker News front page yesterday evening. Titled <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/iPhone-6-An-edgy-concept/7617209"><em>iPhone 6. An edgy concept.</em></a>, &#8220;JohnnyPlaid&#8221; used a number of beautiful 3D renderings to detail some interesting concepts for an iPhone 6, set to hit the market with iOS 8 which, given Apple&#8217;s history, would come sometime next fall.</p>

<p>The first and most striking aspect of Johnny&#8217;s concept is the edge-to-edge display: forgoing the 5&#8217;s left and right borders and slimming the bottom and top swipe areas, his iPhone 6 concept phone looks radically different than its existing predecessor. To call it a complete departure from the iPhone line would not be an inappropriate characterization. Interestingly, as an aside, I do not consider a complete departure such as this one all that unlikely: with iOS 7, Apple may not only hope to overhaul its operating system and associated app ecosystem, but may also use this opportunity to reboot, if you will, the iPhone line, which some believe to have stagnated in recent years.</p>

<p>But back to the screen: Johnny explains that with a battery of touch sensors lining the screen&#8217;s sides, the iPhone 6 would possess the ability to differentiate meaningful touches and gestures from those incurred while innocuously gripping the phone. An interesting idea, to be sure, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;like autocorrect&#160;&#8212;&#160;I feel it may prove unpredictable enough to instill within its users an unhealthy distrust.</p>

<p>Another objection to an edge-to-edge screen lies not in its technical implementation, but rather takes issue with the remaining edges: without its side borders, the top and bottom areas look severely out of place, the last vestiges of a bygone era. If Apple does implement an edge-to-edge display, I feel it must extend to every edge, not just the left and right ones. Alternately, Apple could instead abandon the egregiously out of place black borders for a more neutral color and perhaps overcome the unglamorous transition from beautiful retina display to solid black handles.</p>

<p>With an edge-to-edge display, Apple must also deal with yet another problem: the perception of the iPhone 6 as a fragile device. Although the proposed graphene protective coat overlaying the retina display and combination aluminum and carbon unibody design would make the phone essentially shatterproof, thereby effectively destroying the need for a case, holding what boils down to a pane of thin glass backed with a material of unproven durability would introduce another element of uncertainty in the minds of consumers. In return for a striking new design, Apple would call into question the device&#8217;s durability and, ultimately, quality as well. Perhaps unfortunately, this is a trade off I do not believe Apple will make. Given the opportunity, I would agree wholeheartedly with this decision.</p>

<p>My final objection to the edge-to-edge display is the increase in resolution from 1136x640 at 326 ppi to 754x1296 at 333 ppi: having just undergone a change in screen resolution from the 4S to the 5, forcing developers to once again refactor their apps to fit a new screen size conveys poor planning and a lack of foresight; it shows instability and lack of a single, concrete vision for the platform. While the inconvenience such a move would cause developers would in no way prevent Apple from changing the iPhone&#8217;s screen size once again, I do believe the signals doing so would convey just might.</p>

<p>Next, Johnny introduced &#8220;Lightning 2&#8221;, a combination of Magsafe&#160;&#8212;&#160;the magnetic charging system Apple uses in its computers&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Lightning&#160;&#8212;&#160;the current interface for communicating with Apple&#8217;s latest devices. Although I love the idea of no longer requiring me to skewer my device just to charge it, I don&#8217;t consider &#8220;Lightning 2&#8221; likely: Apple just transitioned from the 30-pin to Lightning connector after almost ten years. If a Magsafe-like adapter for the iPhone was in the works during the iPhone 5&#8217;s development, which it undoubtedly would have been as a major design change, Apple would have forgone the switch to Lightning in anticipation of &#8220;Lightning 2&#8221;&#8217;s release; two more years with the traditional dock connector would not have hurt anyone, and would have made the eventual transition even more dramatic.</p>

<p>Finally, Apple&#8217;s impending foray in to the vehicle industry also hints at stability in its dock connector design. Notoriously slow to innovate, car manufacturers would undoubtedly require some guarantee of stability in this area before creating an entire line of iDevice-compatible cars.</p>

<p>The Magsafe charger front is not the only area in which I disagree with Johnny, but on his proposal of multi-touch gesture support in the bottom border area of the phone as well. Necessitating the removal of the home button, although the idea seems like a good idea at first it falls on its face through further consideration. Introducing an always-on gesture area, and a customizable one at that, would create great confusion when a swipe gesture worked in one app but not another, or preformed differently from app to app. An interesting concept, but an altogether too problematic one&#160;&#8212;&#160;and that&#8217;s putting it lightly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not know enough about the current iPhone&#8217;s components, performance, and power consumption to comment intelligently on the next section of his concept expose, &#8220;Performance &#38; Power&#8221;. I will, however, say that the proposed tech specs are very impressive and worthy of Apple&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>Shaking up both available sizes and associated price tags, Johnny replaces the 16GB model at $199 with the 32GB model at the same price, a price decrease of $100. He also knocks the 64GB device down a tier to $299, and adds two new offerings at 96GB for $399&#160;&#8212;&#160;previously the 64GB device&#8217;s territory&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a 128GB offering at $499. If the iPhone 6 brings with it any changes in this area, it will be the addition of the 128GB model; the 16GB model will remain the cheapest iPhone, and a 96GB model will remain nonexistent, as it always has across all of Apple&#8217;s platforms. It follows that the prices will remain constant, with the only change being the addition of the 128GB model at $499.</p>

<p>Wrapping up his concept, Johnny detailed an 8MP Facetime camera capable of 1080p video&#160;&#8212;&#160;up from 1.2 megapixels in the 5&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a 20.2MP front-facing camera able to record video in 2K resolution, a great leap from the current 8 megapixel camera shooting 1080p video. To my surprise, I found this not all that unlikely.</p>

<p>From the 4S to the 5, Apple did not actually improve upon the camera&#8217;s hardware, although many would argue otherwise based on their own qualitative evidence. With the release of the 5S this fall, the iPhone would be due for an update in this area, an update that would likely bridge the gap between the 8MP and 20.2MP front camera and the 1.2MP and 8MP Facetime camera. Halfway there, Apple would then be forced to break the alternating camera update cycle to reach Johnny&#8217;s predicted levels with the 6, but it would not be unheard of nor particularly surprising if the company did so. I give this a hesitant thumbs-up.</p>

<p>Tucked away in the penultimate spot, the NeverWet waterproof coating is an interesting idea; however, I feel that Johnny did not take it far enough: if Apple does manufacture a waterproof phone, it will be 100% waterproof, able to take photos and videos underwater. Perhaps we will see this in the 6: with the release of the Galaxy S4, the technology to do it well just might have arrived, which is what Apple notoriously waits for in every aspect of their devices.</p>

<p>Finally, the iPhone family featuring an iPhone 6 and, contrary to the popular rumors floating around the internet these days, a vertically-shrunk iPhone Mini. Without dimensions it is impossible to say for sure, but Johnny&#8217;s iPhone Mini appears to be roughly the size of an iPhone 4 and 4S. In my opinion, Johnny went the wrong way: any device segmentation Apple adds to the iPhone line will be in the form of a larger phone, not a smaller one. That said, I find Apple adding a device of another form factor to the iPhone lineup hard to believe.</p>

<p>Johnny laid out a number of interesting points in his article, a truly edgy concept for the iPhone 6. With at least a year until we can determine the accuracy of his prediction, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty exactly what we will and will not see Tim Cook introduce. Johnny is likely not far from the mark though; edgy or not, his concept very likely reveals a great deal of what we will see in the iPhone 6.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead of hurling myself at an insurmountable goal simply because it was named respectably, I came in with a personal best by asking more from my strengths and forgiving my weaknesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an article ostensibly about video games, though it may have just as well been about overcoming barriers by setting aside the often malformed and unrealistic expectations we often place upon both ourselves and our work.</p>

<p>I have always had great trouble starting to write. I seldom found the actual act of writing difficult, only getting started. The same goes for programming: once I had successfully implemented the main functionality I set out to imbue First Crack with, I ceased iterating on the project not for lack of new ideas&#160;&#8212;&#160;with the underlying code functional and working, I wanted to design an accompanying GUI, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;but instead because I lacked the drive to approach such a monumental task. I was burned out, I suppose, tired after working on the same project for months and months, and stuck in a linkblog rut when it came to writing.</p>

<p>I tried things like <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-terrible-first-draft.html">allowing myself to write a poor first draft</a> and dealing with First Crack&#8217;s low-hanging fruit first, but to no avail: I invariably found something else&#160;&#8212;&#160;something significantly less important&#160;&#8212;&#160;to spend my time on. Recognizing this as the serious problem it was, I took countermeasures: I wrote and pushed out articles despite feeling neither empathy nor enthusiasm for any one of them in an attempt at kick starting my writing, I tweaked my regular expressions, and I uninstalled every game on my computer. In the end, after the dust settled, I was left with a bunch of half-baked articles and a great deal of wasted time reinstalling those games. I did improve those regular expressions though. That was a well-spent half hour, at least.</p>

<p>I needed something more, something to supplement my lacking willpower. Pragmatically, in the purest sense of the idea, I needed a distraction-free work environment, a place where nothing was allowed to interrupt me, and I was not allowed to spend my time working on less worthy projects. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-broken-spacebar-and-my-ipad.html">Working on</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/ipad-creation.html">my iPad</a> instead of my computer was a step towards this, although apparently not a long enough one: I still lacked both the faculty and facilities to work productively.</p>

<p>I have always regarded distraction-free writing environments with a certain degree of skepticism, bordering on disdain: the idea of using such a crutch to bolster my writing never appealed to me; it felt like cheating, in a way. I used to be of the opinion that if you really wanted to write, you could do so on the corner of a napkin at a restaurant, and then ask the waitress for another napkin. I believe Merlin Mann said something to this effect in the past. More informative of my opinions on the topic than my dislike of assistance though, taking Sublime Text full screen never made me a better writer, and writing on the iPad&#160;&#8212;&#160;the epitome of distraction-free writing environments&#160;&#8212;&#160;only forced me to draw a fine line between the devices I could and could not create content on. The concept was not flawed though, merely my implementation of it. So went the epiphany preceding my decision to uninstall all the games on my computer. As I said earlier though, that wasn&#8217;t enough: they were just a quick executable away, after all, and an easily-overcome barrier is really no barrier at all. I needed a bigger, more formidable barrier, I decided: I needed to switch operating systems.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Linux has interested me for quite some time now, ever since I partitioned my hard drive and installed it at the tender age of twelve. In my mind, Ubuntu <em>is</em> Linux. As the only easily-implemented, major alternative to Windows, I downloaded the ISO over dinner and spent the next two days partitioning my drive and installing both operating systems more times than I care to remember. And then, finally, everything just worked, and I booted in to Ubuntu 12.04 for the first time. Soon afterwards, I began writing once again.</p>

<p>Ask any fourth grade science fair presenter about finding conclusive results in a scientific experiment and he will describe the importance of maintaining a single variable throughout the process: in order to measure the effect different reactants have on the outcome of an experiment, the circumstances in which it is run must remain constant. In my own experiment, however, I violated this simple rule virtually at the onset: by Tuesday when my computer finally functioned properly, I had a job lined up for the rest of the week, and spent Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday out of the house and away from my writing. With what little time I had available to write on those days, however, I wrote profusely. The question, though, is whether the prolificness with which I wrote can be attributed to my platform switch or rather as an inverse relation with the amount of time spent writing, where as my available time decreases I become an increasingly productive writer. In all honesty, it&#8217;s too early to say quite yet. If I had to lean one way or another though, I would say that although changing platforms did help a great deal, sitting down at the end of the day knowing that I had one solid hour to write, and one solid hour only, has been the greatest motivator of all.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-07-14 10:57:44-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-07.html">07</a>/14 10:57:44 EST</time>
<p>With the minor caveat of having drawn its entire inspiration solely from one of the most unintelligible and idiotic videos I have ever seen, <a href="http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/">Jon Negroni&#8217;s theory</a> that all Pixar movies not only take place within the same world but also serve to establish a connected timeline is nevertheless a very interesting one. Like most conspiracy theories, Jon&#8217;s proposition makes use of many seemingly related happenstances and strings them together in to a plausible proposition, which he then offered up as a work-in-progress theory.</p>

<p>Jon&#8217;s thesis described the mammalian race&#8217;s elevation from dumb beast to near-human intelligence and the associated increase in tension and conflict this rise brought throughout <em>Brave</em>, <em>Ratatouille</em>, and <em>Up</em>, only stayed by the sentient machines&#8217; hostile takeover hinted at in <em>The Incredibles</em> and during the <em>Toy Story</em> series preluding the apocalypse obviously featured in <em>WALL-E</em>. According to Jon, <em>Cars</em> and <em>Cars 2</em> take place some time after Earth becomes uninhabitable for humans, after Buy-n-Large sends the human race away on the Noah&#8217;s Ark-like Axiom, and before <em>WALL-E</em> in the eight hundred years while the machines cleanse the now-polluted planet. During this time the machines achieve their goal of restoring Earth to its previous glory. However, when the humans fail to return, they make a home for themselves, though die out quite some time before <em>WALL-E</em> picks up presumably from lack of fuel, a strong theme in <em>Cars 2</em>. Following <em>WALL-E</em> and the re-colonization of the planet, <em>A Bug&#8217;s Life</em> takes place, and Jon&#8217;s theory dictates either the gradual fade of the human race, unable to sustain themselves on Earth, or a union of the previously-at-war human and animal species as a last-ditch effort to sustain life, the result of which can be found in <em>Monsters Inc</em> and, by extension, <em>Monsters University</em>.</p>

<p>As if all that did not go far enough, Jon threw another curve ball in to the mix by identifying the witch in <em>Brave</em> as Boo from <em>Monsters Inc</em> traveling through time in search of her friend Sully using not necessarily magic, but the doors of <em>Monsters Inc</em> which, rather than opening in to another dimension filled with humans, actually travels through time to a day when mankind still inhabited the Earth.</p>

<p>Characterizing this theory as anything less than fantastic, in every sense of the word, would fall hopelessly short of conveying its brilliance, even if Jon does have it wrong. I wanted to believe him&#160;&#8212;&#160;I really did. I even started writing this article under the assumption not that he was in any way wrong, because I really love the idea of a connected Pixar universe, but that instead he did not have the whole picture: not only were Pixar&#8217;s movies involved in this complex overarching timeline, but Disney&#8217;s own films post-Pixar as well. His failure to see this was how I intended to explain the holes in The Pixar Theory. But as I continued thinking about his theory though, the more I tried to prove its validity the more the evidence against it piled higher and higher until I could not, in good conscience, purport to ascribe to his idea any longer.</p>

<p>Even from the onset, I had my doubts: <em>Brave</em>, <em>Ratatouille</em>, and <em>Up</em> all end happily, as does every Pixar movie. In <em>Brave</em>, the Scotts no longer hunt the elusive black bear, and Merida grows closer to her family by the movie&#8217;s end; at the end of <em>Ratatouille</em>, Remy has his own restaurant alongside Alfredo Linguini; and <em>Up</em> ends with Carl stepping in for Russell&#8217;s absentee father and adopting Doug. None of these movies, as Jon holds in his theory, prelude an eventual war between the human and animal species. The same goes for <em>The Incredibles</em> and the <em>Toy Story</em> trilogy, which allegedly foreshadow an impending mechanical apocalypse: <em>The Incredibles</em> end with Syndrome implicitly&#160;&#8212;&#160;but not explicitly&#160;&#8212;&#160;dead and the robot he created irrecoverably destroyed. And rather than the depressing tale of subjugation, imbalanced reliance, and unrequited love Jon spins <em>Toy Story</em> as, the series is nothing more complex than a story about kids growing up and moving on. In neither movie, <em>The Incredibles</em> nor <em>Toy Story</em>, can the discontent Jon describes as the motivator behind the dystopian mechanical future seen in <em>WALL-E</em> be found.</p>

<p>And then there was <em>Finding Nemo</em>, a movie about fish almost entirely set in the ocean. Other than serving to further the notion of equality between animals and fish supposedly present in <em>Brave</em>, <em>Ratatouille</em>, and <em>Up</em>, I can see no purpose for this movie in the grand Pixar timeline.</p>

<p>Like most conspiracy theories, where the base idea contains at least one kernel of truth amidst each bushel of misconstrued coincidences giving apparent credence to the government&#8217;s latest exploit, Jon found and cited enough evidence to make his theory appear not only credible, but obvious almost. But also like the great majority of conspiracy theories, the evidence seemingly pointing unequivocally toward its factual nature is in actuality nothing more than a series of convenient coincidences that, when looked at from just the right angle, give the impression of certainty. Jon&#8217;s Pixar theory is nothing more than a happy accident, and a very interesting coincidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Part of me think that an entry level iPhone will be very much like an iPod touch with an antenna, with hardware that&#8217;s capable enough to run all of iOS 7&#8217;s features, is better than the any last generation iPhone, but won&#8217;t compare to what&#8217;s inside Apple&#8217;s flagship offering.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then again at the end of the article, Cody Fink of Mac Stories continues in <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/some-thoughts-on-an-entry-level-iphone/"><em>Some Thoughts on an Entry Level iPhone</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The press will try to spin the launch of an entry level iPhone as Apple&#8217;s way of fighting back against cheaper Android phones, as a way to gain ground over a competitor that&#8217;s supposedly winning the smartphone market. I think Apple isn&#8217;t interested in this, but rather in making an affordable phone that meets people&#8217;s expectations of quality in an Apple product. And if Apple can give you something that&#8217;s even better than an iPhone 4 or 4S at the same price, in addition to becoming possibly even more affordable in emerging markets, then that only means good things for consumers.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I read this article and that first excerpt in particular, I realized that the idea of a budget iPhone is not a fundamentally bad one when framed as a high-end iPod Touch instead of an intentionally inferior iPhone. Also of interest in Cody&#8217;s article was his characterization of this budget iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;or high-end iPod Touch?&#160;&#8212;&#160;not as an Android competitor, but simply a quality device designed on a budget. Even though I can&#8217;t quite say I&#8217;m for a cheap iPhone after reading it, Cody&#8217;s article did certainly impact my thoughts on the subject. All in all a great article and one certainly worth the read.</p>

<p>Marco Arment, writing in response to a Hacker News commenter questioning the effectiveness of Apple punditry changing minds within the corporation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a number of times in the last few years that something I wrote was circulated within Apple or brought up in an internal discussion, usually to support one side of a debate. And it&#8217;s very unlikely that Marco.org is the only site that Apple employees read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Copying iOS 7 is going to be a big problem for cheap hardware. iOS 7&#8217;s appearance and dynamics require a powerful GPU and advanced, finely tuned, fully hardware-accelerated graphics and animation APIs. This will hurt web imitators most, but it&#8217;s also going to be problematic for Android: while high-end Android phones have mostly caught up in GPU performance, and recent Android versions have improved UI acceleration, most Android devices sold are neither high-end nor up-to-date.&#8221; - Marco Arment in  <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/27/ios7-as-defense"><em>iOS 7 As Defense</em></a>. Craig Hockenberry made the same point in episode forty-six of John Gruber&#8217;s The Talk Show around minute 35:40.</p>

<p>A cheap iPhone built with inexpensive parts relative to Apple&#8217;s high-end offering would face the same problems an Android device running a mimicry of iOS 7 would. Those challenges could be enough to prevent Android from copying iOS 7, as Marco pointed out in his article cited above; could they be enough to prevent Apple from building a cheap iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;one with components comparable to an Android device&#160;&#8212;&#160;as well? And if not, how much is Apple willing to compromise on its mobile operating system to make this budget device run an iOS 7 lookalike?</p>

<p>My second foray into the world of Apple speculation. In my first, which I titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/apples-wildcard.html"><em>Apple&#8217;s Wildcard</em></a>, I spoke to the possibility of Tim Cook announcing an iPone 6 and budget iPhone this fall: while I consider neither particularly likely, leaning more towards an iPhone 5S as the continuation of Apple&#8217;s apparent tick-tock cycle and disappointment for those waiting on a budget iPhone, I hedged my bets with Tim Cook&#8217;s &#8220;Can&#8217;t innovate, my ass&#8221; comment. Since writing that piece though the budget iPhone has remained a surprisingly popular topic, and thus something I feel I should readdress.</p>

<p>Not to rehash my entire article, but in <em>Apple&#8217;s Wildcard</em> I cited a lack of market for a cheaper iPhone as one of the main reasons those waiting for it would once again find only disappointment when Tim Cook walked off the stage this fall. I pointed to the iPod Touch as the device meant for those desiring an iPhone-like experience without the contract, and the now free with contract iPhone 4 as the phone for everyone else unwilling to purchase the latest and greatest model. Between those two devices, I reasoned, no middle ground existed: there was effectively no market for a cheap iPhone not addressed by these two offerings, and thus no way Apple would build such a device.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I made an egregious error: I ignored the entire Android handset market, the people who desire more than a flip phone, cannot or will not purchase the newest offering from Apple, and refuse to settle for the carrier&#8217;s free with contract iPhone. I ignored the entire market Samsung in particular caters to, the addressable market for a budget iPhone. Despite having realized my mistake though, I still hold out hope that Apple will forgo entering this market. Even now, when not a day goes by without a new article heralding the release of a plastic iPhone, I stand by my original sentiment in principle: Apple should not enter this market.</p>

<p>By definition, a cheaper iPhone would sport inferior components as compared to Apple&#8217;s high-end offering. More than simply replacing the aluminum shell though, as many seem to consider the sole requisite sacrifice, chasing a low price point would also entail filling the device with unremarkable components. As that target price point lowers, so too will the quality of the device&#8217;s components, and by extension its performance as well. At the cost of a smaller price tag, Apple will introduce hallmarks of the PC and Android worlds: disparate user experiences, device segmentation, and stymied platform development as app makers cease pushing the platform&#8217;s boundaries and begin coding for the least common denominator. And these are only the disadvantages on the technical side: introducing an intentionally inferior device would also damage the company&#8217;s reputation as a creator of quality devices, all for the sake of capturing the mid-range market. Apple forgoes this admittedly sizable market in the computing and tablet industries&#160;&#8212;&#160;why enter it in the smartphone space?</p>

<p>At some point in this discussion, after the last vestiges of my previous arguments are torn down and trampled upon, I must bring up one final objection before setting my standard down for the last time. Through the iPhone&#8217;s premium price point, Apple has divided the smartphone market and snatched its high end. Herein lies one of the main reasons the community surrounding iOS and Apple in general is so highly regarded within tech circles. With the release of a cheap iPhone, Apple would effectively destroy that barrier. Just as the removal of a dam preludes a deluge down stream, the willful removal of this barrier would lead to an influx of the kind of user whose absence has made the Apple ecosystem the Eden it is today; it would cheapen the user base and severely weaken its credibility, all for the sake of capturing the mid-range. And that&#8217;s a sacrifice I don&#8217;t think Apple should be willing to make, regardless of the target market&#8217;s size.</p>

<p>At some point, though, despite these and other valid arguments against Apple building and releasing a cheap iPhone, one must admit that where there is smoke, there is fire, and that there just might be something to these rumors. Until the day that Tim Cook holds up a plastic iPhone though, I will hold out hope that at least for the foreseeable future, Apple will stick to its guns, continue making the best phones it can possibly manufacture, and stay away from the low-end.</p>

<p>For the most part I try to stay away from Apple speculation: quite simply, I neither know enough about the company&#8217;s past and present situation nor do I pay close enough attention to pick up on the subtleties of this practice. Then I read an interesting article speculating about Apple&#8217;s Fall hardware announcements, and I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>From Aaron Souppouris&#8217;s article on The Verge, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4451240/iphone-5s-rumors-dual-led-flash-fingerprint-scanner"><em>Rumored iPhone &#8216;5S&#8217; takes shape in leaked images of assembled components</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;According to numerous sources, the iPhone 5S will be released this fall alongside a cheaper plastic iPhone.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two rumors here: that Apple will release the iPhone 5S in the Fall, and that a budget iPhone will come out alongside it. The first is, I think, a no-brainer: since the iPhone 3G and 3GS, Apple has been on a tick-tock cycle in the mobile phone space. After the 3G and the 3GS came the 4 and then the 4S, followed by the 5 just a few short months ago. It seems to follow that the 5S comes next as the logical progression of this process.</p>

<p>Or so it would seem. The wildcard here is Tim Cook&#8217;s statement after introducing the Mac Pro: &#8220;Can&#8217;t innovate, my ass.&#8221; All logic seems to point to the 5S as Apple&#8217;s next phone; however, what if Tim Cook just really, <em>really</em> wanted to give all the people who wrote stories about innovation being dead at Apple, all the pundits and Apple haters, and maybe Samsung in particular, a big FU and release another major update to their flagship product just six months after its debut? It&#8217;s a long shot, I know, but Apple under Tim Cook is a very different Apple than Under Steve Jobs, and Tim Cook&#8217;s Apple might just do it.</p>

<p>And then we have the long-rumored &#8220;budget iPhone&#8221;. First of all, the name itself is a bit of a misnomer: it implies a <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/06/20/pegatron-ceo-cheap-iphone/">cheap product</a>, something that Apple just won&#8217;t do. For those looking to have an iPhone-like experience without the contract, Apple keeps the iPod Touch alive; for everyone else not keen on purchasing the latest and greatest phone, the iPhone 4 now comes free with a contract. There&#8217;s no market for a cheap iPhone: Apple already addresses all those potential use cases with existing products.</p>

<p>However, I have to once again disregard the obviating factors pointing in every direction away from a &#8220;budget iPhone&#8221; and introduce the wildcard, Tim Cook. As I already said, Apple under Tim Cook is a very different place than when Steve Jobs manned the helm. After all, we have iOS 7 now, a product that we almost assuredly would not have seen for quite some time&#160;&#8212;&#160;if ever&#160;&#8212;&#160;had the decision been left to Steve Jobs and his buddy Scott Forestall. I&#8217;m sure between the two of them they could have found some more green felt.</p>

<p>All indications point to an iPhone 5S coming this fall, and that those looking for a &#8220;budget iPhone&#8221; will once again see disappointment when Tim Cooks walks off the stage without introducing one. But maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;we will get to hear Tim Cook&#8217;s &#8220;Can&#8217;t innovate, my ass&#8221; comment again preceding the iPhone 6 announcement and a new, cheaper iPhone. Maybe that will be his &#8220;One more thing&#8221;.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-07-04 15:45:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-07.html">07</a>/04 15:45:51 EST</time>
<p>I ask this question every time I open the app: <em>What happened to Instapaper?</em> After its sale both <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/04/25/instapaper-next-generation">Marco</a> and Betaworks seemed so enthusiastic about the popular read later service&#8217;s future. Since then two months have gone by without a peep from anyone&#160;&#8212;&#160;not even a point release.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not a bad thing. It&#8217;s no secret that after Google&#8217;s decision to shutter Google Reader, <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/53203926175/digg-reader-update">Digg&#8217;s entire staff put every effort in to creating a replacement from scratch</a>, effectively putting a stop to work on every other project, including Instapaper. Now that Digg Reader is out though, work on those other projects will undoubtedly resume, and we will soon see a major new version of Instapaper&#160;&#8212;&#160;of this I am sure: especially after such a prolonged period of inactivity leading up to Marco&#8217;s sale of the service, Betaworks will want to come out swinging with Instapaper 5. Not another point release, but a full-on major update to the internet&#8217;s favorite read-later service.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an exciting time for this product that such a large majority of the internet&#8217;s most influential personalities use. I can&#8217;t wait to see what Betaworks makes of this opportunity.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-07-04 09:43:35-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-07.html">07</a>/04 09:43:35 EST</time>
<p>I hate the word &#8220;sexting&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;I really do. It sounds as if a sixth-grader invented it in jest and whose parents, upon overhearing it, decided to apply it as the label for the act of sending lewd pictures on a mobile device. Or maybe the fated decision was left to a lonely man in the poorly-lit corner cubicle, laboring under a flickering fluorescent light: &#8220;Texting and sex... &#8216;Tex&#8217;? No, that&#8217;s not it. &#8216;Sex texting&#8217;? Too long. Ha, that&#8217;s what she said... &#8216;Stex&#8217;? Still no; drat.&#8221; Regardless of whoever picked the term though, it stuck, and it stuck to Snapchat.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not here to say that Snapchat does not deserve the title; to anyone arguing otherwise, come on over, I have a mountain to sell you. Prime real estate, I tell ya. Snapchat&#8217;s creators may not have set out to create the go-to application for sending naked and otherwise inappropriate images, but it did make the process extremely easy. And as the creators of Bittorrent will tell you, making something capable of facilitating illicit actions and relying on the conscious and morals of your audience isn&#8217;t exactly a rock-solid business model.</p>

<p>Snapchat does deserve the title; it does not, however, deserve the stigma that such a title brings to the app. I have friends who keep Snapchat buried within a folder on their phone&#8217;s last screen just to prevent its accidental discovery by the curious parent. Security through obscurity at its best. Others completely dismiss the app, citing the lack of a need to sext&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>ugh</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;as a validating reason behind their refusal to take part in this morally bankrupting pastime. But what if naked pictures were not the only images wafting through Snapchat&#8217;s servers? What if parents realized that the mere presence of the app did not indicate inappropriate behavior, just as the presence of a web browser does not conclusively lead to the rabid consumption of pornography? I&#8217;m not trying to say that Snapchat is not used for all those things and more, just that like anything there are good and bad sides to it.</p>

<p>I use Snapchat almost every day. On my lunch break I often send a smiling picture to my girlfriend just to say hi. Nothing inappropriate there. Sometimes I use it to say hi to my friends&#160;&#8212;&#160;my male friends&#160;&#8212;&#160;back in Minnesota. Nothing like leaving pictures of warm sunny days for them to find after shoveling a driveway. I even use it to say hi to my best friend&#8217;s sister on occasion. In each case I neither have the time nor patience to snap a picture, attach it to an iMessage, and spend five minutes waiting for it to send. And God forbid I have to re-send it as a text message. With Snapchat all I have to do is snap the picture, choose as many recipients as I wish, and hit send; within a few seconds the picture is not only send, but delivered as well.</p>

<p>There are so many great ways to use this app with a shirt on, and so many ways it outclasses Messages&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least for sharing pictures&#160;&#8212;&#160;that it makes me sad to see such negativity and even hatred stemming from the manner in which this subset of users makes use of Snapchat&#8217;s core functionality. Not everyone uses it to propagate naked pictures of themselves; some just want a quick and easy way to say hi to their girlfriend.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bye-instacast.html">Speaking of app redesigns</a>, Nevan Mrgan tweeted a screenshot of an app he was in the process of redesigning for iOS 7. Unlike Instacast 4&#8217;s mockups, this one looks like it will fit right in.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-07-01 21:45:58-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-07.html">07</a>/01 21:45:58 EST</time>
<p>Two days ago Betaworks&#160;&#8212;&#160;creator of the popular iOS game Dots, the company behind Digg&#8217;s rise back to fame, and proud owner of Instapaper&#160;&#8212;&#160;opened Digg Reader to the public after greatly accelerating its development following the announcement of Google Reader&#8217;s impending demise. Especially for a product upon which work was not schedule to begin until the end of this year, Digg Reader is a very impressive entrant into the RSS reader market.</p>

<p>Ever since the site&#8217;s redesign, I have found myself going to Digg increasingly often in search of new and interesting things to read. And almost every time I do, I find something great&#160;&#8212;&#160;an article that, in all likelihood, I would not have come across otherwise. That&#8217;s more than I can say for every other news-based website I visit, much less those I browse on a daily basis. This seemingly unending stream of excellent prose has placed Digg near the center of my content consumption; with the release of Digg Reader, the company has moved one step closer to that nucleus, taking my favorite news site and primary content medium and bring them together in an attractively clean interface nothing short of a joy to use.</p>

<p>Digg Reader falls short in many areas: anyone arguing otherwise clearly has not used the service. It has a lot of potential though, potential that only time will bring out. And time was the one thing Betaworks did not have in the scramble to build and release a viable contender before Google Reader closed its doors. Now they do.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks and months as Betaworks continues to improve upon this new product, as I am sure they will, I will be looking forward to seeing tight Instapaper integration and interesting sharing options making use of the company&#8217;s core offerings. Betaworks has the opportunity to bring every aspect of my news gathering and processing workflow&#160;&#8212;&#160;the main Digg site, RSS, and Instapaper&#160;&#8212;&#160;to one app. Betaworks has that opportunity, and I believe they will capitalize on it.</p>

<p>A few days ago Instacast&#8217;s created <a href="https://twitter.com/vemedio/status/349480265703358465">tweeted some mockups of the app&#8217;s next iteration</a>. As a diehard Instacast fan, I was very excited to get a sneak peek at the next version of the popular podcasting app.</p>

<p>The mockups, however, did not impress me in the least: instead of a bold new design, they looked remarkably similar to the current interface. With buttons in the corners, list and single-episode views reminiscent of Instacast 3, and even a similar color scheme, I was extremely disappointed. Granted these were nothing more than &#8220;doodlings&#8221;, but with already counting down to iOS 7&#8217;s launch I have to wonder how different the final design will look as compared to this concept. And if that final design does not change significantly&#160;&#8212;&#160;in other words, if Instacast 4 designed with iOS 7 in mind looks this similar to Instacast 3 designed for iOS 6&#160;&#8212;&#160;we might just say have to say goodbye to Instacast this fall.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago now Yahoo bought Tumblr for more than a billion dollars; responding to the news, Marco Arment wrote <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/05/20/one-person-product"><em>The One-Person Product</em></a>. In <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-75-mean-baby.html">episode seventy-five</a> of Roderick on the Line, John talked about watching successful young artists blow fortunes one CD at a time. On <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/120">the one hundred and twentieth episode of their Back to Work program</a>, Dan and Merlin discussed a common topic between Marco&#8217;s article and John&#8217;s podcast, the topic of a safety net.</p>

<p>By way of closing <em>The One-Person Product</em>, Marco explained that although his windfall by way of the Tumblr acquisition was by no means enough to buy a yacht or helicopter, it was enough to give him and his family a strong safety net. A strong enough safety net to give him the freedom to work on whatever he wanted, in fact, without needing to make it immediately profitable. In other words, the need to make money governed which ventures Marco could explore; in the absence of that need, he became comfortable with working on projects not necessarily whose success was questionable, but whose profitability was in some degree of doubt.</p>

<p>During <em>The Egg MacGuffin</em>, Dan and Merlin used Marco&#8217;s article as a segue to ask a very interesting question: What are you not doing now, that you would do if you had some sort of safety net? And why does not having that safety net prevent you from making something good? In characteristic Back to Work fashion&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I don&#8217;t necessarily mean this in a negative way, except that I do&#160;&#8212;&#160;the duo eventually relegated the problem to the individual.</p>

<p>The usual Back to Work conclusion places blame on the individual rather than that individual&#8217;s circumstances, and for good reason: when I have trouble finding time to write, blaming my job won&#8217;t solve a thing, but stepping back and realizing that I need to sit down and write with what little time I do have does. Changing my mindset is much easier than finding a new job. In general, I agree with Dan and Merlin, and the opinions they express are generally ones I can get behind at least in part, if not fully. But this case is the exception, the one where I want to agree with them, but I just can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Before I got a job, I devoted the better part of sixteen hours a day to this site in some form or another; I alternated between reading and writing almost constantly. But now that I have a job, now that I work at least eight hours every day, I am only able to spend a fraction of the time I used to on this site. Articles that would have taken me a day from inception to final copy now spans several days, if not weeks. No matter what I do, I cannot create like I used to: it is physically impossible to produce content of equivalent quality and quantity in half the time. No amount of determination, distraction-free writing environment, or revamped workflow would change that. A safety net, on the other hand, would.</p>

<p>If I woke up tomorrow morning and no longer needed to work, and if for some reason I chose not to work anymore, I could go back to spending the majority of my waking hours on this site. I could write all those articles I no longer have time to write; I could finally learn to build iOS apps, and begin work on that cool app idea I had six months ago. I could do so many things that just aren&#8217;t possible now. There are only so many hours in a day, after all, and with a strong safety net in place I could spend the vast majority of those hours working on, well, whatever I wanted. Until then though, until the iOS app I labored away at on nights and weekends hits the App Store, until my monthly pageviews measure in the tens of thousands instead of just the tens, I will do just that: continue working on nights and weekends, hoping that one day I can weave a strong enough safety net to go all-in on a single venture with the hopes of hitting it big.</p>

<p>I really enjoy reading Matt Gemmell&#8217;s writing. His article from quite a while ago, <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/01/15/writing-tools/"><em>Writing Tools</em></a>, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/matt-gemmell.html">caught my attention</a>, and <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/06/12/ios-7/"><em>iOS 7</em></a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/matt-gemmell-on-ios-7.html">greatly impressed me</a>. So, earlier this afternoon, I subscribed to his site; ironically, <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/01/25/the-unfollower/">The Unfollower</a> was the first article I read after doing so. Continuing the previously-established trend of excellence, this piece was no exception.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed the manner in which he handles people unfollowing him and attempting to dictate the topics he writes about. Oftentimes writers&#160;&#8212;&#160;myself included&#160;&#8212;&#160;forgo saying anything that <em>might</em> offend a reader; Matt Gemmell just doesn&#8217;t care:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my position: I&#8217;m not publishing a newspaper that you&#8217;ve purchased. You walked into my house. I&#8217;m OK with you hanging around, but 100<code> of the rules are made by me, and 100</code> compliance is absolutely mandatory. You get zero say in my content. There is no Letters Page for your complaint. You can&#8217;t ask to talk to my superior, because I&#8217;m at the top of the tree - and I&#8217;m going to agree with me.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great article, well worth the read. More from him coming up, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

<p>While I don&#8217;t agree with many of the author&#8217;s points, nor do I agree with her overarching theme, she did, however, say a number of interesting things throughout the piece. I tried, for the most part, to stay away from articles written on this topic, but this one is well worth the read.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes an app great is the little things &#160;&#8212;&#160; the small details that take something normal and turn it into something extraordinary. I see iOS 7 as a blank canvas &#160;&#8212;&#160; an &#8216;un-design&#8217; if you will. The goal of a 3rd-party isn&#8217;t to copy the stock apps pixel for pixel (that wasn&#8217;t the goal for iOS 1-6, and it&#8217;s not the goal now). Rather this is Apple saying it&#8217;s time to re-imagine what mobile software should look and act like. Five-hundred million people are using iOS devices, and it&#8217;s time for the training wheels to come off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marco Arment made a similar point in is article <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/11/fertile-ground"><em>Fertile Ground</em></a>. As I said in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/fertile-ground.html">my link to the piece</a>, I&#8217;m very excited for this Fall.</p>

<p>In this morass of terribly-written prose, Rene Ritchie did manage to make an interesting point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The problem is that Apple listened, and now instead of being a trend creator they are &#8216;following&#8217; trends.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I can&#8217;t say I necessarily agree with this opinion, it is nevertheless a very interesting one, and one that I haven&#8217;t see voiced since the WWDC keynote nearly a week ago.</p>

<p>Working my way through The B&#38;B Podcast&#8217;s back catalog I came across episode seventy-three, <em>Faded Avocado</em>, during which Shawn and Ben talked about Marcelo Somer&#8217;s piece <a href="http://behindcompanies.com/2012/08/the-linkblog-cancer/"><em>The Linkblog Cancer</em></a>. This article sparked a controversy that went viral a few months ago, a controversy even the likes of <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/09/linkblog-cancer/">Jim Dalrymple</a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/09/linkblogs">Marco Arment</a> felt the need to respond to. I even mentioned it, albeit briefly, in my article <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/reinventing-the-linkblog.html"><em>Reinventing the Linkblog</em></a>.</p>

<p>For those curious, Ben and Shawn argued both sides very well and made a number of great points. If you have to pick one episode of The B&#38;B Podcast to listen to, this is a good choice.</p>

<p>ReadWrite&#8217;s new site looks fantastic, very reminiscent of Digg&#8217;s current design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It would have been easy at that point to rest on our laurels. But we and our colleagues at Say Media, our parent company, whose technology and design teams worked tirelessly on this launch, wanted to keep pushing our design forward and drop the remnants of the &#8217;90s-era Web that clung to our site.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apple has set fire to iOS. Everything&#8217;s in flux. Those with the least to lose have the most to gain, because this fall, hundreds of millions of people will start demanding apps for a platform with thousands of old, stale players and not many new, nimble alternatives. If you want to enter a category that&#8217;s crowded on iOS 6, and you&#8217;re one of the few that exclusively targets iOS 7, your app can look better, work better, and be faster and cheaper to develop than most competing apps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I see why this article was at the top of the Hacker News front page. Marco is very hopeful for this fall, and rightly so: iOS 7 does indeed present a rare opportunity for existing markets to be disrupted by brand new entrants. I&#8217;m extremely excited to see what comes next, especially from Marco. We are moving towards a very interesting time; buckle up and hold on.</p>

<p>Almost every time Apple releases a new version of iOS, someone has the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=shit%20from%3Amarcoarment&src=typd">Marco Arment &#8220;Well, shit&#8221; moment</a>. The time, most prominently, it was <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password&#8217;s</a> turn, although other small, one-off app developers likely had similar reactions throughout the keynote.</p>

<p>In a Macworld article titled <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2041404/why-ios-7-will-kill-some-apps-and-make-others-stronger-.html"><em>Why iOS 7 Will Kill Some Apps</em></a> Leah Yamshon theorized that this type of move, when Apple enters an established app space with an entrant of their own, often effectively crushing the market, may actually have a silver lining:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My guess is that these types of apps will see fewer App Store downloads after the launch of iOS 7 later this year&#160;&#8212;&#160;if their developers stand still and make no dramatic changes to their apps. But by the same token, these new standard Apple features could also inspire those same third-party developers to innovate and make their existing apps better to remain competitive.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m very interested to see where Agile Bits takes 1Password in the coming weeks and months after this announcement. Maybe nothing will change: just as Instapaper remained successful following Apple&#8217;s entrance&#160;&#8212;&#160;if it could be called that&#160;&#8212;&#160;in to the &#8220;read later&#8221; app market, iCloud Keychain could experience similarly mediocre success and thus not significantly impact 1Password. On the other hand, this move could also create additional business for Agile Bits as people who otherwise would not have purchased 1Password realize its usefulness through iCloud Keychain and then, in search of a superior solution, come across 1Password. There is, of course, also the possibility that iCloud Keychain could pull the rug out from under 1Password and completely steal the market. But really, does anyone expect that to happen? That they will continue to innovate, however, I have no doubt; won&#8217;t hurt to have some extra incentive though, especially if this newfound pressure forces Agile Bits to kick innovation in to high gear, just for good measure.</p>

<p>The temptation certainly exists to criticize Satoru Iwata and his decision not to bring the company&#8217;s most popular titles to mobile gaming platforms like iOS; however, looking beyond our disappointment at being unable to play Pokemon and Mario Kart on the iPhone, we can look at the situation dispassionately and draw a number of parallels between Nintendo and Apple, Satoru Iwata and Steve Jobs: both men led (and lead) their respective corporations with a complicated, long-term vision for success. As the sole possessor of this grand master plan, Iwata&#8217;s decisions, like Jobs&#8217;s, sometimes seem nonsensical and even cryptic, in a way. Nonsensical or not though, no one in their right mind would argue that Steve Jobs was anything less than a genius; perhaps, in time, the same will prove true of Satoru Iwata.</p>

<p>Wonderfully worded and impressively well thought-out, Matt Gemmel&#8217;s article <em>iOS 7</em> is easily the best piece on the topic I have read since the WWDC keynote address. In explaining the motivation behind Apple&#8217;s complete UI overhaul in iOS7, he began his one-two punch with this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The thing is, we&#8217;ve grown up. We don&#8217;t require hand-holding to tell us what to click or tap. Interactivity is a matter of invitation, and physical cues are only one specific type. iOS 7 is an iOS for a more mature consumer, who understands that digital surfaces are interactive, and who doesn&#8217;t want anything getting in the way of their content.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, following up, he said something <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/anti-ios-7-anger.html">curiously familiar</a> before moving on with the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The basic functionality hasn&#8217;t changed. You still use iOS in the same way, and almost everything is where you expect it to be. The same gestures work. There are a few differences here and there - it&#8217;s a major new version of the OS, after all - but the changes are mostly aesthetic. You won&#8217;t be confused by iOS 7 if you&#8217;re accustomed to a previous version.&#8221;</p>

<p>I try to, for the most part, stay positive when I write on here. Instead of taking a page out of Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s play book, not that there is anything wrong with his approach, and calling shenanigans and bullshit when I see shenanigans and bullshit, I try to &#8220;take the high road&#8221; and either ignore bad writing and poorly-formed opinions altogether, or criticize them generously. In the wake of the iOS 7 announcement though, many people have said things that I consider&#160;&#8212;&#160;quite frankly&#160;&#8212;&#160;stupid, especially concerning iOS 7&#8217;s overhauled interface.</p>

<p>Last night I came across Josh Topolsky&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.theverge.com/apple/2013/6/10/4416726/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing"><em>The Design of iOS 7: Simply Confusing</em></a>, and I had to write about it. Maybe because I was tired, or maybe because I have a tendency to come upon Josh&#8217;s work only when his and my opinions are at extreme odds, I decided that I could not let this farcical work stand unopposed; I could not let it go uncriticized. I don&#8217;t mean to single out Josh and his opinions, for they are not an uncommon sentiment in the Apple nerd community; his article was merely the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, so to speak.</p>

<p>Starting at the top of the article, Josh began on a sane, level-headed note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What I saw today at Apple&#8217;s annual WWDC event in the new iOS 7 was a radical departure from the previous design of the company&#8217;s operating system &#160;&#8212;&#160; what CEO Tim Cook called &#8216;a stunning new user interface.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far so good. In his first sentence, Josh echoed a very widespread observation. After six years sporting nearly the same design it debuted with, iOS was due for the major face lift it received in iOS 7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;But whether this new design is actually good design, well, that&#8217;s a different story entirely.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the line that got me, the one that made me want to write this. iOS 7 is still iOS no matter how you look at it. Underneath the translucent panes, the control center, and the revamped icon sets, the same iOS underpinnings we have come to know and love still drive the operating system: the core functionality of the platform remained the same; the new user interface did not change that. So arguing &#8220;whether this new design is actually good design&#8221; becomes an argument based on aesthetics, conjecturing as to whether the look and feel of iOS&#8217;s latest iteration is, in fact, good design. And while the opinions on this topic vary widely, I can&#8217;t help but answer with a resounding &#8220;YES&#8221;, as I am sure most will in time.</p>

<p>Josh went on to discuss other aspects of the new design, but I will not dissect them here: I have made my point. In the wake of the WWDC keynote, many seem to have forgotten this simple fact: iOS 7 is still iOS, just updated for the next generation of mobile devices. This is what innovation looks like, and Apple came out swinging yesterday with these amazing innovations. &#8220;Can&#8217;t innovate, my ass.&#8221;</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-06-11 19:11:55-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-06.html">06</a>/11 19:11:55 EST</time>
<p>Surrounded by Tweetbot on my iPhone, iMore&#8217;s live blog on one iPad and Apple&#8217;s keynote stream on another, and flanked by my inconveniently inoperable computer, I watched Tim Cook introduce iOS 7. Even now, I can&#8217;t quite quantify the feeling I had upon seeing iOS 7 for the first time: a mixture of surprise and relief at the departure from almost every previously-held design philosophy, amazement for reasons that anyone who watched the keynote or read one of the many blog posts recapping the event would find obvious, and perhaps even euphoria for some inexplicable reason. iOS 7 is beautiful, plain and simple, and the reason my next computer will be a Mac.</p>

<p>I have been moving in this direction for quite some time. Initially a die-hard PC fanboy in virtually every negative sense of the word, I refused to even acknowledge the Mac as a viable platform. But as time passed, I grew in many ways: I got older and, arguably, wiser; my workflow distilled and solidified until I used the same four or five applications every day; and I became more and more open-minded as I slowly fell in to the Apple ecosystem. It started with an iPod Nano and continued with an iPod Touch, an iPad, and then an iPhone. Even more instrumental in my prolonged and drawn-out conversion, however, than Apple&#8217;s own products was Dan Benjamin and the 5by5 network. Made up of podcasts hosted primarily by Apple nerds focusing on Apple-related topics, as the weeks turned in to months and the months turned in to years I gradually grew accustomed to the idea of owning a Mac, and then I began to want one. Prior to the WWDC keynote earlier this afternoon though, even as I loaded the live blogs and began streaming the event on my iPad and my iPhone, I still hadn&#8217;t made a conscious decision to purchase a Mac. The last vestiges of my anti-Mac PC fanboy days still lingered: Macs cost <em>so</em> much after all. For the amount of money I would spend on a new Mac, I could buy a PC with better specs and still have money left over. Or so my reasoning went.</p>

<p>And then Tim Cook introduced iOS 7, and it was nothing short of amazing; I was floored, curiously euphoric, for some reason. I laughed out loud not because I found any aspect of the redesign humorous, but because I was just so <em>happy</em>. I could spend an entire paragraph telling you how I felt seeing iOS&#8217;s UI overhaul but, as I said earlier, I can&#8217;t quite put it to words. I can, however, put to words the certainties I walked away from the announcement with: Apple is in no way unable to iterate and by no measure averse to change, as iOS 7&#8217;s <em>complete</em> overhaul and the new incredibly small Mac Pro demonstrated. This is a forward-facing company on the bleeding edge of technology; this is the company from which the next big thing will come. Not from Google, Samsung, Microsoft, or Dell, but from Apple. These are the truths the Apple nerds, and I use that designation only with the greatest amount of respect, have known for years, some even since the dawn of the Mac.</p>

<p>These are the truths I finally realized watching Tim Cook introduce the next-generation mobile computing platform; these are the truths that forced me to step back and realize that it was high time I bought a Mac.</p>

<p>Although I make it a point not to spend much time talking about my personal life on this blog, it occasionally creeps in to my writing in the form of an anecdote, perhaps, or the inspiration for an entire article. A few weeks before Christmas last year, I linked to an article by Jason Snell titled <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2018600/why-im-writing-on-the-ipad.html"><em>Why I&#8217;m Writing on the iPad</em></a>, in which he talked about a time when he was forced to write using a pen and paper rather than on a computer. In <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writing-on-the-ipad.html">my brief article linking to that piece</a>, I talked about a six month period during which I kept a journal for a person very near and dear to my heart. I happened across that article a few minutes ago in the process of writing a new piece, and this paragraph struck a chord:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Over the past six months I made it a point to keep a journal. Not so that I could reflect on my feelings twenty years from now, but so that I could give it to someone very dear to me as a Christmas gift. Rather than keep the journal on my computer as I would have preferred to with any sort of activity requiring me to write extensively though, I chose to forsake the immutability digitality affords and put pen to paper to create something inherently more valuable than it would have been as a collection of text files printed on 8.5x11 paper. Although my handwriting, just as Jason Snell&#8217;s, was then and still is&#160;&#8212;&#160;although to a lesser degree now&#160;&#8212;&#160;quite poor, I was very happy with the result. As was she.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to toot my own horn&#160;&#8212;&#160;but honestly, to toot my own horn&#160;&#8212;&#160;that&#8217;s some pretty good writing, and something I&#8217;m very proud of.</p>

<p>For the past three days, I&#8217;ve gotten out of &#8220;the office&#8221; to write, meaning instead of in my room where I usually write, I went outside and sat in the backyard. And it&#8217;s done wonders for my work.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read articles suggesting such an exodus from the traditional place of work in the past, but never placed very much stock in them.

<p>Up until now, I have, with but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/smart-&#38;-funny.html">one exception</a>, abstained from writing a single article containing anything but simple text. That exception, a video from Merlin Mann, Scott Simpson, and Adam Lisagor titled <a href="http://vimeo.com/1212142">Smart and Funny</a>, was just too good to resist: I couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of not posting it, of not sharing this hilarious video with everyone that happened to visit my site.</p>

<p>As I said, that video is the only exception, an exception I made because it was <em>great</em>. Today, a new Tumblr popped up called Unsplash. Every ten days, the curator of Unsplash posts ten new hi-resolution photos, free for anyone to use in all their glory. The first ten are nothing short of amazing&#160;&#8212;&#160;not great, even better: amazing. I can&#8217;t wait to see the next batch.</p>

<p>I have to keep reminding myself that I like The Magazine and Glenn Fleishman, that Facebook is not the epitome of evil, and that just because The Magazine now has a Facebook page doesn&#8217;t necessarily signal the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>For the past week or so, I&#8217;ve been on a bit of a writing binge. With school finally done for the summer, I suddenly found myself with a lot of free time I quickly filled with writing at every possible moment. I started and finished <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeons-experiment.html"><em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em></a> over the first six days, and wrote a number of much smaller articles and link posts since then. All in all, it&#8217;s been a great few days.</p>

<p>In times like this, when I write and write almost constantly, I often touch on new topics very briefly or revisit the subjects of past posts, often a result of only writing a brief article on said topic the first time around. Regardless of the reason though, it&#8217;s not uncommon for me to revisit a topic I wrote about in the past. I used to worry about sounding repetitive and boring, then I listened to a recent episode of Back to Work where Merlin Mann said, in passing while talking about Inbox Zero, something along the lines of, &#8220;It&#8217;s a little self-involved to think that everyone is familiar with all your work, and that just because you wrote something a year ago that they have seen it.&#8221; As usual, it was not until long after I heard these words that I realized how impactful they really are.</p>

<p>As Glenn Fleishman said in the article&#8217;s opening sentence, Marco has indeed had a very busy few weeks lately. I&#8217;m very enthusiastic about the changes Glenn plans to make in the coming weeks and months with the publication of an actual print volume and the advent of a complementary podcast. Until now I haven&#8217;t made time to subscribe despite constantly hearing wonderful things about The Magazine; who knows, maybe this will get me to bite the bullet and spend my summer reading.</p>

<p>Writing about writing has always held great interest for me. That&#8217;s why, when I saw Shawn Blanc&#8217;s article <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/05/the-root-of-non-writing/"><em>The Root of Non-Writing</em></a> pop up in Reeder earlier this afternoon, I read it, saved it to Instapaper, and then read it again. I love metawriting.</p>

<p>The idea of setting out to write with the explicit intention of creating a terrible first draft has always interested me as a concept more than something I would actually implement in my own writing. After all, what&#8217;s the point in writing something if it&#8217;s 1) going to be terrible and 2) need rewritten almost entirely? Or so my reasoning went, and then I read Shawn&#8217;s article.</p>

<p>Turns out&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>turns out</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;Shawn, unsurprisingly, made an excellent argument: allowing yourself a bad first draft at least gets you writing; from there, making incremental improvements or completely overhauling the piece is just a quick, spur of the moment decision away; the decision is completely up to you. But you started writing, that&#8217;s the important thing. Once you&#8217;ve started, the rest is easy&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least, much easier than gathering the courage to fill a blank page with words while simultaneously facing an inordinate amount of misplaced fear of creating something not even bad, but just not good enough in your own eyes. Getting started is the hard part; after that, in the brilliant words of Jacques Clouseau, everything else flows like liquid mercury flowing down a sloping...thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;With each paragraph you write, double the amount of time you spend editing. It&#8217;s not just grammar and spelling errors that might be hurting your credibility. Is your point clear, literate, and concise? Have you pruned aggressively to find the core of what you&#8217;re saying? With each additional paragraph, the higher the chance becomes that you&#8217;ve made an egregious mistake that might make your email confusing and forgettable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael Lopp explaining why engineers, in his experience, appear to hate you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In your company, there are three kinds of people. There are those you are aware of, but who don&#8217;t immediately affect your world. There are those who mildly affect  your world and upon whom you have a lightweight dependency. And there are those who are an active part of your world. You depend on them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to depend on you. It&#8217;s nothing personal, it&#8217;s just that as an engineer I irrationally believe that anything I don&#8217;t build with my own hands is going to get fucked up by someone else. I believe this because I&#8217;ve spent a good portion of my life watching other well-meaning people sit down at a computer and simply... make things harder for themselves.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Replace &#8220;company&#8221; with &#8220;life&#8221; in the first paragraph and he just explained me. The entire article, in fact, and his characterization of the engineer describes my personality to a T. Well said, Mr. Lopp, well said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cap on WWDC tickets means it won&#8217;t go the way of SXSW - a wildly successful conference that has grown consistently since its inception. I used to go every year until one late night we looked around a huge sea of strangers and decided that we no longer knew this conference. The experience had become diluted. It had become unfamiliar, full of strangers, and unknowable.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the most part, I didn&#8217;t follow the discussion surrounding WWDC ticket sales after they sold out in under two minutes. I read <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/26/the-lottery">John Siracusa&#8217;s article</a> on the topic, but for the most part stayed out of the conversation. I haven&#8217;t ever gone to WWDC, after all, nor do I plan to in the foreseeable future. From the few articles I did see, however, and based on the numerous podcasts that touched on the subject, I noticed that by far the vast majority criticized Apple for capping WWDC attendance at 5,000. Michael Lopp&#8217;s piece linked at the top of this article was the only piece of note I came across defending Apple&#8217;s decision, and easily the best.</p>

<p>As a brief aside before you go on your way, before tonight I had only heard of Michael Lopp in name. Specifically, I remember this one time, very distinctly for some reason, John Gruber mentioned him and his blog on an episode of The Talk Show. After reading <em>Unknowable</em>, I took a few minutes to check out his site. Ten minutes later I finished adding Rands in Repose to my RSS reader; I was very impressed. Over the next half hour I jumped between this article and <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/08/28/youre_not_listening.html"><em>You&#8217;re Not Listening</em></a>, an article from last year about verbal communication and all its curious little nuances. It was a very interesting read and a representative sample of the type and quality of article Michael Lopp writes. As I suggested at the end of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tumblr-plus-yahoo.html"><em>Tumblr. + Yahoo! = !!</em></a>, if you are unfamiliar with his work, go check it out.</p>

<p>Almost a week ago I did something I rarely do: I wrote an article out of frustration. I had pushed and pushed myself to not only write every day, but to publish something at least once a day as well. But some days, there just isn&#8217;t anything to write about; sometimes, I need more than a day to work through an idea; and some days, I just don&#8217;t feel like writing. Instead of a strong readership, I only had frustration to show for my efforts. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writers-guilt.html"><em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em></a> was me saying that I had had enough: I was finished prolonging this never-ending sprint, constantly pushing myself to make and publish work I was not proud of. Then I decided to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/shifting-gears.html">shift gears</a>, looking to a shift in focus to revitalize my writing. Almost a week later, I&#8217;m here to say it worked.</p>

<p>Shortly after publishing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/shifting-gears.html"><em>Shifting Gears</em></a>, I started writing again. After I wrote and published <em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em>, as I sat back in my chair and started to calm down, I realized it wasn&#8217;t the writer&#8217;s craft I hated after all, just the pressure to write. Without it even for such a short period of time, I began to feel the familiar itch to create something new; I wanted to write again, and so I did.</p>

<p>For the next few hours, I wrote constantly: I made drafts, brainstormed possible topics almost as fast as I could toss them out, and began piecing together a new article I had wanted to write for quite some time. I spent a few hours that day and then every available moment until last night writing that article, and then I posted it earlier this evening, six days after its inception. Curiously titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeons-experiment.html"><em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em></a>, this is the first longform piece I have written in quite some time. In a way, I view it as my return to writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;to real writing, not the piddly linkblog &#8220;writing&#8221; all too common these days, but to real prose built word by word and honed to a document I feel happy to call my own.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-05-29 19:53:46-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-05.html">05</a>/29 19:53:46 EST</time>
<p>The first time I saw the Nickelodeon cartoon <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, I was sitting in a friend&#8217;s closet. The floor was a mess, with clothes and toys strewn all about. It had rained almost constantly since morning, so the lot of us had stayed inside for most of the day. I was ten, and the show captivated me. That feeling stuck with me until roughly six years later when I sat down to watch the series from beginning to end. Even at sixteen, I still loved the show. Love the show, I should say&#160;&#8212;&#160;present tense, not past.</p>

<p>Looking back, I couldn&#8217;t possibly pick one trait and hold it on high as the single reason I watched every single episode. The action, the story, the characters themselves, or the animation alone didn&#8217;t do it; the unique combination of these and many other traits did, however, and left me thirsty for more when the series ended after just sixty-one episodes. Thankfully, the two-hour finale did not mark the demise of the Avatar franchise, nor did the disaster of a movie released in 2010. The live action adaptation of the popular cartoon titled <em>The Last Airbender</em>, making use of the show&#8217;s name recognition and fanbase, attained box office success. However, for its blatant disregard of even the most basic original story elements, few regard it as anything but a failure and a huge disappointment. In 2012, four years after <em>The Last Airbender</em> ended and two years following the live-action misnomer, <em>Avatar: The Legend of Korra</em> premiered. Initially set for a a limited run of twelve episodes, Nickelodeon quickly expanded the series to fifty-two episodes divided in to four books, much like the prequel. <em>The Legend of Korra</em> attracted the largest audience for an animated series in the U.S. last year, continuing <em>The Last Airbender</em>&#8217;s impressive trend of widespread acclaim.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to nearly every other American animated series of the last twenty years, Nickelodeon of all companies brought amazing fit and finish back to the once-proud American animation first with <em>The Last Airbender</em> and then later with its sequel, <em>The Legend of Korra</em>. Both installments featured drawings and character designs heavily influenced by Japanese animators, giving each season a unique look on the American television scene. The show also received great praise for dealing with difficult sociopolitical issues such as war, industrial expansion, nationalism, terrorism, inequality, complex governments, and civil unrest in the context of such a young target audience, along with more germane issues like broken families, depression, and love. Especially surprising given its production of many second-rate cartoons in the recent past, Nickelodeon&#8217;s experiment proved a massive success due to the previously- and since-unseen combination of these and many other fantastic elements.</p>

<p>In <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, the opening sequence introduces bending and reveals the world&#8217;s geography before chronicling the Fire Nation&#8217;s brutal rise to power. A highly industrialized and very prosperous country, many similarities exist between the Fire Nation and Germany circa 1940. Eager to expand his power Hitler, not unlike Fire Lord Sozin, set in to motion the events leading up to World War II with the invasion of Poland, whereas Sozin sparked the One Hundred Years War with the genocide of the Air Nomads. A highly spiritual people devoted to living simply and in harmony with nature, the systematic extermination of the Air Nomads prompted the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom to declare war upon the Fire Nation, just as Hitler&#8217;s continued aggression and daily horrors finally prompted Britain, Russia, and eventually America to join forces Germany.</p>

<p>While the Earth Kingdom, as the second world power, did possess sufficient forces to openly challenge the Fire Nation, a lack of political unity and a misguided sense of security afforded them by the large, seemingly-impregnable stone walls surrounding the capital city&#160;&#8212;&#160;very similar to the reasons American refused to enter World War II until quite late in the conflict&#160;&#8212;&#160;made them weak and their influence on the war&#8217;s outcome negligible. The Water Tribes, on the other hand, entered the war woefully unprepared, and suffered greatly for it. Like the Native American Indians facing American expansion in the West, no amount of bravery and courage could stand in the face of such a technologically-advanced and merciless foe; the Southern Water Tribe was the first nation to fall.</p>

<p>Led by a power-crazed ruler the Fire Nation, like the highly-militarized Germany of World War II under the the autocratic rule of Hitler, expanded its influence in an ill-waged war. Without the Avatar to restore balance, the fighting plunged the world in to chaos for more than one hundred years. Herein lie some of the most interesting historical threads present in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>; however, they are by no means the only ones. In the Earth Kingdom&#8217;s Dai Li, for example, we find a cautionary tale of secret police, political intrigue, treachery, and greed as if taken from the pages of history itself.</p>

<p>Using the background of <em>The Last Airbender</em> as a jumping-off point, <em>The Legend of Korra</em> took place seventy years after the previous series ended in the newly-formed Republic City, capital of the United Republic of Nations. Established after the end of the Hundred Year War by Fire Lord Zuko and Avatar Aang, the United Republic of Nations existed as a sovereign entity where benders and non-benders of all nationalities could live together in peace. Because of its setting in Republic City rather than the world of four distinctly separate nations, <em>The Legend of Korra</em> featured a very different set of political and emotional undertones than <em>The Last Airbender</em>.</p>

<p>Described as &#8220;if Manhattan had happened in Asia&#8221; and &#8220;the Roaring &#8216;20s with an Asian twist&#8221;, Republic City faced many of the same challenges large metropolises like Manhattan faced in the early twentieth century. Namely, corruption, inequality, and civil unrest. Playing to these emotions, the series&#8217; main villain Amon attempted to seize control of the city in a violent power play that nearly destroyed it, not unlike the tactics the likes of Julius Caesar employed to steal control of Rome from the Senate. Through this adventure <em>The Legend of Korra</em>&#8217;s writers addressed the politically-charged topic of terrorism along with class inequality and civil unrest, and received much praise for doing so.</p>

<p>In addition to the complex subjects of war, classism, and civil unrest, the writers of the Avatar series also dealt with a number of other controversial topics in a novel way, including death: rather than something to avoid at all costs, it became a key plot element. Death&#8217;s general absence from the series made the few episodes in which it did appear remarkably impactful, especially in <em>The Legend of Korra</em>. After Tarlock used false charges to imprison Avatar Korra&#8217;s friends, she demanded their release; he refused, and a particularly fierce battle broke out in which Korra quickly gained the upper hand. In order to save himself, Tarlock revealed his ability to bloodbend in a desperate last-ditch maneuver to stay Korra&#8217;s deadly onslaught. Implicitly emphasized in this scene, Tarlock&#8217;s brief brush with death proved his last. Later in the series, after Korra revealed Amon&#8217;s true identity as a waterbender, he lost all support from the Equalist party. With no other options left, Amon freed his brother Tarlock and the pair made their escape on a speed boat. Feeling great remorse over both his and his brother&#8217;s actions though, Tarlock used one of Amon&#8217;s own weapons to ignite the boat&#8217;s gas tanks in a stunning murder-suicide off the coast of Republic City. The one and only barefaced encounter with death in the entire season, this was one of the strongest scenes in <em>The Legend of Korra</em> and possibly the entire Avatar series.</p>

<p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> and <em>Avatar: The Legend of Korra</em> received well-deserved and widespread praise for the superficial elements of the shows. Behind the superb animation, excellent sound design, and a wonderfully engaging plot, even more praiseworthy elements existed though, elements not apparent at first glance but nevertheless incredibly important. These key elements took the show from mediocre to extraordinary, earning these two series a place among the greatest animations to come from America in more than a decade.</p>

<p>Since January first, 2009, Jonathan Mann has written a song every day. Every single day, for four years, four months, and four weeks exactly, Jonathan Mann, without fail, wrote and produced a song. That&#8217;s 1609 days, and 1609 songs. Those who have a hard time writing every day, feel free to take notes.</p>

<p>His song for Hypercritical, <a href="http://youtu.be/pOyDW_Y2Emo">#1450</a>, and what became the Accidental Tech Podcast&#8217;s ending theme, <a href="http://youtu.be/iCXItGrjqrw">#1546</a>, are my two favorites.

<p>In the past I have heard it said that there exists but one story, that every book and movie is nothing more than retelling of that single plot. Perhaps most famously, John Steinbeck <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/36570-we-have-only-one-story-all-novels-all-poetry-are">once said something to this effect</a> in his book East of Eden:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I wholly agree with this, but it is nevertheless a very interesting observation.</p>

<p>Nearly every day I see a new CSS module, jQuery boilerplate, or HTML5 template posted to Hacker News, or an article announcing the release of the latest version of Ember.js, whatever that is. Every so often, I follow the link out of curiosity; and every time, I close the page, disappointed.</p>

<p>Earlier this afternoon, I came across <a href="http://topcoat.io/">Topcoat</a> and <a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure</a>, both CSS libraries, on the front page of Hacker News. They were no exception to the rule detailed above: I followed the link out of curiosity, then closed the page in disappointment. I could not, in the roughly five seconds I spent browsing each page, discern either&#8217;s purpose. In my book, that&#8217;s a failure: when I visit your website, you have upwards of five second to convince me to stay; after that, I&#8217;m gone.</p>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writers-guilt.html"><em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em></a> a few hours ago, I was done. I was drained. I was finished, and I was mad. Nevertheless, for an article written in anger, it turned out to be pretty good. As I walked downstairs after publishing it, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel just a little proud. Then I had a banana, an orange, sat down on the couch, and watched The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift for the first time in much too long. I had forgotten how great a movie it is&#160;&#8212;&#160;I had forgotten how great the entire series is, really. But after Tokyo Drift ended, as the last scene faded from the screen and the credits began to roll, I remembered. I remembered how much I love the series; I remembered how much I love movies.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s Moises rubbing off on me, but as I was sitting on the couch with a cool, post-storm breeze coming in through the window behind me, listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/42">episode forty-two of CMD+SPACE</a>, I found the something I had been searching for while writing <em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em>.</p>

<p>At its inception, <em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em> began as an explanation of how I had yet to find my voice in writing. I wanted to put to words my realization that the tech topics I had covered up to this point&#160;&#8212;&#160;while interesting to me, yes&#160;&#8212;&#160;did not inspire me, and that inspiration was what I needed to do the one thing that constantly frustrates me: write regularly. Alas, the article instead turned in to a &#8220;forget you, I&#8217;ll do what I want&#8221; sort of piece. I was missing my voice, after all, and I couldn&#8217;t write without it.</p>

<p>With a cool breeze blowing in behind me, I found my voice in the credits of Tokyo Drift. Technology has always fascinated me; it will forever remain a passion of mine and something that I will undoubtedly continue to write about. Even more than technology though, I love movies and TV shows. That&#8217;s a topic I can write about, and maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;a topic I can write about every day.</p>

<p>Some days, I want to write. Other days, I don&#8217;t. Today is one of the latter, and yet I still wrote this. Why?</p>

<p>I tried over and over, time and time again to write today. With the school year coming to a close and exams beginning next week, I have an inordinate amount of free time on my hands, time that I wanted to fill writing. All I have to show for my efforts though is a blank screen, a blinking cursor, and more guilt than I know what to do with.</p>

<p>Some days, inspiration drives me to write. Other days, I get caught in the heat of the moment and can&#8217;t help but write about the most popular news story. More often than not though, maddeningly often, it&#8217;s not inspiration or competition that pushes me to shut everything out and write for a while, but a crushing feeling of guilt. Guilt that I haven&#8217;t written anything for one, two, or three days; guilt that I spent my time not writing. This isn&#8217;t at all unusual; I do it almost every week. Just as Monday comes back around every  seven days, so does this stupid cycle, and I hate it. I do it partly out of fear, reasoning that if I don&#8217;t write or at least post something every day, the small readership I do have will disappear. The other part of it though, by far the lion&#8217;s share, comes from this arbitrary quota I force upon myself. I have a blog, after all; it follows that it is my prerogative, as the owner of that site, to write and to write often.</p>

<p>But you know what? I&#8217;ll write on the days I&#8217;ll write, and I won&#8217;t on the days I won&#8217;t. Today is the last day I let guilt drive me to write, lost readership or not. Here&#8217;s to not writing and not feeling guilty about it. Cheers.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-05-22 11:07:39-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-05.html">05</a>/22 11:07:39 EST</time>
<p>I used to write almost exclusively on my computer. Then, my spacebar started going bad sometime around November of last year, inconveniently just before I launched this blog. Especially problematic given how much and how often I like to write, I nevertheless decided not to fix it: right around that time the flame war around the iPad as solely a content consumption versus a multi-faceted creation device was raging across the internet, and I wanted to decide what I would use my own iPad for myself.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been six months since then; I still haven&#8217;t fixed my spacebar.</p>

<p>At first, it was tough: I jumped in without any preparation, and my experience suffered for it. Instead of creating a new workflow around this new medium, I attempted to adapt my iPad to the way I was used to working on my computer. I wrote in text files stored remotely and synced the documents to my computer via Dropbox. Even when I finally moved away form this approach, I excluded any service incapable of syncing to my desktop machine. My Windows machine. To say this restriction severely limited my options would be an understatement. I eventually found Simplenote though, and for a while life was good: Simplenote had a decent desktop client, the iOS app worked well, and the syncing seemed rock-solid.</p>

<p>I used Simplenote for quite a while. As time passed though, as Simplenote&#8217;s syncing idiosyncrasies became more and more pronounced, I gradually came to terms with the reality that it was time to move on to better things. I had tried purely iOS text editors in the past, but all fell short of my expectations in one way or another. Then I found Drafts; shortly thereafter, Simplenote was but a distant memory. Within the space of three months, I had gone from a desktop-centric workflow to focus solely on iOS.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been three months since then; I haven&#8217;t looked back.</p>

<p>Today I still use Simplenote occasionally: every once in a while I look back through my notes to find an article fragment or something of the kind. All my writing happens on iOS these days though, in Drafts, where the only tie to the desktop computing world sits at the top of a list, labeled with &#8220;Send to Dropbox&#8221;. Had you told me six months ago that today, I would have forsaken my beloved Sublime Text for a touchscreen keyboard on my iPad, I would have laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; I would say, &#8220;you can&#8217;t write on an iPad.&#8221; Oh how I was wrong.</p>

<p>Quite some time ago I came across a very interesting statement in the most unlikely of places, in a &#8220;tips and tricks&#8221; piece sensationally titled <a href="http://twohourblogger.com/genius/"><em>10 Rare But Simple Blog Tricks that Make You Look Like a Genius</em></a>, where the author writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It seems as though there are a dozen really powerful bloggers who control the Internet. This group decides who becomes famous and who does not. They set the standard for what a well-designed blog should look like. They write the best copy and win the most subscribers. And everyone knows it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this passage just as fascinating today as I did months ago when I came across it. And while my knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss it as ludicrous, a bit of reflection changed my mind.</p>

<p>When I set out to design this website, I went through a great number of iterations. I looked to all sorts of places for inspiration, including many of the popular blogs I follow. This was before I had decided to begin publishing this blog; I was creating a site purely as an exercise&#160;&#8212;&#160;something to do in my spare time. Then, once I finally decided to take this blog from a WordPress site I updated occasionally to something I put significant effort in to, I spent a significant amount of time deliberating as to what I would write about. In this case I also looked to many of the popular blogs I follow for inspiration, though less so than when designing the site&#8217;s look and feel.</p>

<p>Fast-forward six months to today and I post every original article I write to Hacker News; occasionally, I send one of a few popular bloggers a link to these pieces in the hopes that one day Jim Dalrymple will like one of my articles well enough to link it, or Dan and Haddie might find something I write cool enough to merit mentioning on The Frequency. Sensationalist-title-writing-blogger, 2; me, 0. Might as well give him that last point as well: arguing that it&#8217;s not Shawn Blanc and Ben Brooks that write the best copy and win the most subscribers would be ridiculous. And everyone knows it.</p>

<p>On January 18th Horace Dediu made two observations and posted them to Twitter. Shortly after those tweets went live, I began constructing a short article around them. Either unable or simply unwilling to finish the article though, the beginnings of this piece have remained in Simplenote since then. Now, with my Instapaper queue finally completely empty for the first time since I bought the app, I finally have the time and&#160;&#8212;&#160;more importantly&#160;&#8212;&#160; available attention to begin working through my back catalog of half-baked articles, the first of which is this one about Apple bloggers.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/asymco/status/292318761137106947">Horace&#8217;s first tweet</a>, and the one that inspired me to write this aritlce:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Apple critics have been disrupted by the low end of their profession.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco/status/292319596504035328">the second</a>, posted a few minutes later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good enough&#8217; criticism of Apple has swamped the sophisticated critic&#8217;s nuanced appeal.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the last couple years in particular, sites like Tumblr and the like have made it increasingly easier to publish content to the web. As the barrier to entry lowered, the popularity of this new medium grew across all topics, with new writers of varying calibers popping up every day, hoping to attract an audience for their thoughts and ideas. In this sense, I wholeheartedly agree with Horace: the sophisticated critic&#8217;s nuanced appeal has indeed been swamped with mediocre criticism of Apple. I do not, however, agree with his first statement, that those sophisticated critics have at all been disrupted by these mediocre writers. If anything, I would argue that the existence of a low-end in their professions has made those exceedingly good at analyzing and critiqueing Apple stand out more so than would have been possible in their absence. Not that the existence of a low-end is wholly a boon to the Apple bloggers, but it&#8217;s also not quite as bad as everyone portrays it to be.</p>

<p>Those with interesting and unique things to say, the writers who convey those thoughts and ideas well, will eventually gain an audience and, by extension, the ability to effect change in this space; this much the internet has proven. Conversely, the copycats, mediocre writers, and those merely parroting the words of others will never have a significant impact upon the blogging community. This much the internet has also proven.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is almost exactly <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-8-bit-nintendo-phone.html">what I imagined the Nintendo phone would look like</a>&#8221;, I thought when I came across the <a href="http://jolla.com">Jolla</a> phone this morning in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/finnish-meego-startup-jolla-reveals-first-phone-hardware-with-customisable-shells-e399-price-tag-coming-at-years-end/">a Tech Crunch article</a>. The same principles that inspired my &#8220;8-Bit Nintendo Phone&#8221; appeared to have driven the creators of the Jolla phone to design a product innovative in both its hardware and software alike. Unfortunately, this phone will not come to America for quite some time; however, based on the information available at the company&#8217;s home page, I formulated a few admittedly premature thoughts on this topic.</p>

<p>The first and single most advertised aspect of the Jolla phone is &#8220;the Other Half&#8221;, seemingly a glorified skin. Its simplicity, however, belies its true potential: &#8220;the Other Half&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;heretofore referred to as simply &#8220;the case&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;not only personalizes the phone&#8217;s exterior, but its interior as well. With each case the operating system&#8217;s color scheme changes to present a single, unified color pallet. In other words, an orange case means an orange operating system. The power of &#8220;the Other Half&#8221; is not limited to mere color schemes though: individual applications and data can be linked to each case, essentially creating a multi-user device where the cases are the username and password to each account. This hardware/software pairing, where a piece of hardware so significantly impacts the software experience, from the apps available to the system&#8217;s color scheme, is fascinating to me and perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Jolla phone.</p>

<p>Perhaps just as interesting though is Jolla as a company and Jolla the phone as an idea, and what the pair means to the smartphone industry. In the current Apple-Samsung duopoly, the entrance of a third player, albeit a small one, is interesting in and of itself. Combined with the innovative product that company is attempting to bring to the market though, that&#8217;s when things get interesting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m less hopeful for Jolla&#8217;s prospects than I would be if it were Nintendo&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially Nintendo&#160;&#8212;&#160;bringing this phone to market, of that much I am sure. That&#8217;s not to say a small company can&#8217;t make some waves though, and that&#8217;s not to say Jolla can&#8217;t experience some level of success. After all, once upon a time Apple was a small company too. Jolla&#8217;s staff could take a lesson from Apple in at least one respect though: announcing the Jolla phone more than half a year before its launch date, Natasha Lomas of Tech Crunch made a good point in questioning whether or not the company would be able to sustain interest in their product. As enthusiastic as I am about the interesting innovations this phone is bringing to market, I can&#8217;t say even I will remember to check back in seven months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Per the agreement and our promise not to screw it up, Tumblr will be independently operated as a separate business. David Karp will remain CEO. The product, service and brand will continue to be defined and developed separately with the same Tumblr irreverence, wit, and commitment to empower creators.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lot of people have written about this announcement. They started when rumors of the acquisition began gaining significant traction yesterday and haven&#8217;t stopped since. For all the long-winded articles explaining how this deal undoubtedly spells the end of Tumblr and the hissy fits of those lashing out as if anyone cares to listen though, Myke Hurley put it best in <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke/status/336175686832246784">a tweet from yesterday evening</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s fair to say Marissa Mayer is giving us <em>exactly</em> what we hoped.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>She is building an exciting Yahoo!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahoo! under Marissa Mayer has been doing a lot of interesting things lately. She really has built an exciting Yahoo!, and one that I look forward to seeing many great things come from in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>I try to post something every day. Most days I accomplish this goal, while occasionally I go an entire week without a single post. Most of the updates I publish are links to the works of others, something insightful, funny, or interesting I found while plowing through my Instapaper queue. Occasionally though, every once in a while, the proverbial muse, making his rounds, comes around and hits me especially hard. After a few hours of heads-down writing, I emerge with a couple link posts and a few actual articles tucked under my arm, ready to post. And then the cycle repeats itself: I spend another week or two forcing myself to read and eventually write something dull until, once again, I feel the inspiration to actually write a real article.</p>

<p>Moises writing about the three lingering problems plaguing Nintendo these days, and what he believes are the best solutions to those issues. In the last point under problem #2, &#8220;Nintendo isn&#8217;t simple anymore&#8221;, Moises introduces a concept he discussed with Horace on the eighty-third episode of The Critical Path, <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/83"><em>The Analyst Taxonomy</em></a>: the idea of a <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-8-bit-nintendo-phone.html">Nintendo phone</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If Nintendo is actually serious about staying in hardware, they should be developing a phone. That the most profitable gaming platform (mobile phones) completely lacks Nintendo software is bizarre.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Their tablet platform already exists, and is attached to their set-top box. The same VirtualConsole-scale games could run on a phone with physical gameplay buttons, just as they do on the Wii U GamePad and the 3DS. They already make a mobile-scale OS, and have been doing so for years. Their classic games just don&#8217;t work on phones that have no physical controls. If anyone can truly break through with a smart gamerphone, it would be Nintendo, but they show no interest whatsoever in this space.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the article Moises drew a number of parallels between Nintendo and Apple, culminating with the suggestion that Nintendo come out and an offering not unlike the Apple TV to close the piece. As I said in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-8-bit-nintendo-phone.html"><em>The 8-Bit Nintendo Phone</em></a>, such a comparison is not only apt but also very appropriate given the similarities between the two. I can only hope that those similarities extend beyond Nintendo&#8217;s aptitude for hardware and software creation to the ability to disrupt existing markets with revolutionary new products.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A tremendous amount of work has gone into every aspect of The Loop magazine from the fonts and design, to the writers I chose to be part of it. I want readers to enjoy every single article in a clean, ad-free environment. They should look forward to every issue because the experience was so good.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Prior to last Thursday, The Magazine was the only item on my Newsstand bookshelf. Marco Arment finally has some company.</p>

<p>I often start strong: I have an idea, direction, and inspiration; I know where I want to take this brand new piece and how I will get there. If I&#8217;m lucky, that article will go live within a day or two of its inception; if not, well, that&#8217;s when I have a problem.</p>

<p>The last article I wrote I called &#8220;<a href="https://zacs.site/blog/printing-money.html">Printing Money</a>&#8221;. I started writing that piece on December first of last year, more than five months ago. After a few days I lost interest, and it remained an unfinished blurb until last week when I stumbled across it. Last week, meaning it sat in Drafts for somewhere in the ballpark of three days to just under a week after I rediscovered it and before I put any effort into improving it, before last night when I sat down in Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and put enough work in to the aticle to call it finished enough to publish without feeling too guilty. I did the same thing with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/citational-fallacy.html"><em>Citational Fallacy</em></a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-key-to-education-reform.html"><em>The Key to Education Reform</em></a>, establishing an unfortunate trend. I had such high hopes and grand aspriations for those three articles at the onset, and look at them now: a shadow of what they could have been. Still good by most standards, but far inferior to the articles I could have published had I set them on the back burner and waited a while instead of forging ahead and publishing each article before it was actually ready.</p>

<p>The idea that one could earn a living through blogging, especially considering the relative infancy of the computing industry as a whole and the internet in particular, fascinates me. Twenty years ago, such an occupation did not exist; today, websites like <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/">The Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco.org</a>, and <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each month, generating a steady and respectable cash flow for their respective authors Jim Dalrymple, Marco Arment, and John Gruber. When I started writing this article five months ago, before it fell through the cracks and was lost until just recently, The Loop attracted an average of 400,000 visitors every month and claimed an audience of more than 17,000 Twitter followers. Today, those numbers have jumped up to an average monthly audience of 1,230,000 and a Twitter following just shy of 31,000 between The Loop&#8217;s own account and Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s. As for Marco.org, five months ago the site engaged an audience of around 500,000 every month and a mere 1,500 people followed the associated Twitter account, whereas today the two mediums have increased to 600,000 and just over 5,500, respectively. Daring Fireball, impressively, boasted an amazing mean of 4,000,000 pageviews each month, which has increased to somewhere between four and five million since then, and a Twitter following of 43,500, up to 55,000 in recent months.</p>

<p>Before continuing I would like to make something very, very clear: my intent in presenting these numbers is not to glorify one site while degrading another or to in any way poke fun at a particular blog, but simply to make known the extremely impressive audiences these sites lay claim to in order to lend credence to this next batch of numbers dealing with the revenue of each blog.</p>

<p>The Loop, Marco.org, and Daring Fireball all achieve profitability through sponsored blog posts and ads via The Deck, a service I will touch on later. The sponsored blog posts run for six or seven days and sell for $1,500 on The Loop, up from $1,000; $2,400 at Marco.org; and a whopping $8,500 on Daring Fireball, up from $7,500 five months ago, and $6,500 before then. As of this writing, each site has no more than three open spots up to mid to late July and early August. On The Loop, for each sponsor Jim Dalrymple makes two blog posts, places an item in the sidebar, and posts two tweets&#160;&#8212;&#160;one at the beginning of the week, and one at the end. Similarly, John Gruber posts twice thanking the week&#8217;s sponsor, once as an actual post and again as a Linked List item. Finally Marco, who previously did not make sponsored posts and only generated revenue through his site from The Deck, thanks each sponsor once during the week in a post syndicated across the site, the RSS feed, and the Marco.org twitter account.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, all three blogs also make use of a service called <a href="http://decknetwork.net/">The Deck</a>. During my research of The Deck in preparation for this post, I found a number of aspects of this ad network intriguing. Of these aspects, the one I found most notable deals with selection of sponsors: rather than allowing any site or service to run an ad on The Deck, Jim Coudal, the site&#8217;s owner, must have used and, if applicable, paid for the site or service in question. Not only that though, he must also <em>like</em> the service. Though the analysis and discussion of such a business model could&#160;&#8212;&#160;and may, in fact, at some point in time&#160;&#8212;&#160;become an article of its own, a brief overview of its effects must suffice for now. By limiting the number of sponsors featured through The Deck, Jim Coudal has cultivated a strong brand association with his network. As Horace Dediu discussed in an early episode of <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath">The Critical Path</a>, in order to succeed a company must affiliate itself with a positive idea. In The Deck&#8217;s case, the affiliation conveys quality and craftsmanship, ensuring anyone viewing an ad accompanied by the disclaimer &#8220;Ads via The Deck&#8221; that the product in question excels at its purpose.</p>

<p>As for The Deck&#8217;s revenue model, week-long ad campaigns sell for $8,900 and guarantee in the ballpark of 765,000 impressions over the span of the ad. Alternately, advertisers can also purchase a &#8220;roadblock&#8221; which, in exchange for $8,900 per day, guarantees that every ad appearing on The Deck&#8217;s fifty-two sites comes from a single source. Based on last month&#8217;s numbers, that equates to roughly 3,642,000 impressions. Unfortunately, these are the only publicly-available figures for The Deck; no one but those already a part of the network know just how much revenue The Deck brings to the sites its ads appear on. Even with only the few figures available on The Deck&#8217;s site and the few others we can derive with a bit of math, The Deck is still a very interesting initiative and will likely be the topic of a future post.</p>

<p>Through these two revenue models John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple both make a living, and Marco Arment uses this additional source to supplement his diverse income stream. Regardless of what purpose it serves though, each site inarguably generates an impressive amount of money every single month, proving that there is, after all, money to be made blogging.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Alittlebitaboutthisarticle">A little bit about this article<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Alittlebitaboutthisarticle">#</a></span></h3>
<p>I chose to write about the blogs of Jim Dalrymple, Marco Arment, and John Gruber for one simple reason: each of the aforementioned bloggers either currently co-hosts or at one point in time co-hosted a podcast on the 5by5 network, of which I am a huge fan.</p>

<p>Although I initially intended to also discuss podcast sponsorships, I decided that the business models of these two mediums was too different to discuss in the same post, and so I left that topic for a future article.</p>

<p>Over the year he spent without the internet, Paul Miller wrote <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/8/3007525/paul-miller-offline">thirty-five articles</a> for The Verge. I have only gotten to a few of these dispatches so far, but I already added the rest to my Instapaper queue. This isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> a story about a guy who got tired of the internet; it&#8217;s a story about a guy who got tired of the internet, an interesting story about a guy who did something about it, and a moving story about how that decision effected his life. It would be impossible for me to praise this venture enough to give Paul Miller the credit he is due, so just go and read about it. Start with the first post, aptly titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/30/2988798/paul-miller-year-without-internet/in/2771566"><em>I&#8217;m leaving the internet for a year</em></a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps more noteworthy is Reeder&#8217;s new, standalone RSS feature &#160;&#8212;&#160; you don&#8217;t even need a Feedbin or Google Reader account anymore. Instead, you can start curating RSS feeds right on your iPhone; if you had a Google Reader account you can also simply import your feeds straight from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Great news. Reeder is easily my favorite iOS RSS reader, and definitely one of the best on the market. This new feature makes it all the more appealing not just to me as an existing customer, but hopefully to potential future users as well. I just imported all my Google Reader feeds in to the app, and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>In 2012, Betaworks purchased Digg; a year later in 2013, the company <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader">announced a revamped list of priorities</a> placing a <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/46251309499/whats-next">successor to Google Reader at the top</a>, and acquired Instapaper a few months later.

<p>The idea of a Nintendo phone, initially proposed by Moises Chiullan and Horace Dediu on episode eighty-three of The Critical Path, has continued to gain traction in my mind since I listened to <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/83"><em>The Analyst Taxonomy</em></a>. As Moises pointed out in the tail end of the show Nintendo, like Apple, possesses the capability to not only manufacture physical devices, but to create the software necessary to run them as well.</p>

<p>The last Nintendo device I used extensively, the Gameboy Advance, immediately jumped out as the perfect example of the company&#8217;s synergistic nature: the device was physically excellent&#160;&#8212;&#160;as the countless hours I spent tapping those deceptively durable buttons and staring at that curiously wonderful screen can attest to&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the underlying software made for an exceptional user experience. Granted, Nintendo&#8217;s hand in creating the user-facing elements of the Gameboy Advance&#8217;s software experience was likely negligible; however, Nintendo&#8217;s more recent contributions to the gaming space&#160;&#8212;&#160;the Wii, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;demonstrate at least a competence in this area, if not some level of excellence.</p>

<p>These were the ideas that Horace and Moises&#8217;s discussion set into motion, and the set of ideas that lent further credence to the notion of an &#8220;8-Bit Nintendo Phone&#8221;, as I called it in this post&#8217;s title. I used &#8220;8-Bit&#8221; to mean a number of things not actually connected with the textbook definition of the phrase. First and foremost, I used it as a way to hearken back to the days of the Gameboy Advance where the quality of the device&#8217;s design and software left an exceedingly positive and lasting impression on me. More than a nod to the glory days when Nintendo was the dominant portable gaming platform though, the phrase belies a mantra demanding simplicity in both hardware and software, a philosophy that would set the Nintendo Phone apart from the incumbents in all areas. After several years of growth and development, an unconventional approach is exactly what a company whose sights are set on the smartphone market must have in order to differentiate its product and achieve success. And as we saw with the massively successful Wii, Nintendo is one of the few companies willing to discard the norm and approach problems in novel, unconventional ways.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-05-07 07:39:18-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-05.html">05</a>/07 07:39:18 EST</time>
<p>Shortly after Merlin Mann posted <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/47631308074/chasing-the-right-zero"><em>Chasing the Right Zero</em></a> I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/chasing-the-right-zero.html">linked to the article</a>, as did most of the internet. With <em>Chasing the Right Zero</em>, Merlin wrote the article I had had simmering on the back burner for months, putting to words my epiphany regarding Inbox Zero and the real meaning behind the philosophy. At the time I felt no need to add anything to his words or quantify my own opinions on the subject, so my linked list post contained nothing but a short pull quote. Merlin had made the real meaning behind Inbox Zero very clear, after all; I had nothing further to add to the conversation. And then Shawn Carolan guest posted an article titled <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/05/05/the-myth-of-inbox-zero-and-the-path-to-peace-of-mind/"><em>The myth of Inbox Zero and the path to peace of mind</em></a> on GigaOM. Apparently it was not so clear.</p>

<p>While Shawn appeared to grasp the philosophy behind Inbox Zero on a superficial level, his narrow understanding of the underlying principles behind the mantra was palpable from the onset. Rather than picking Shawn&#8217;s piece apart paragraph by paragraph, point by point though, I&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise to you the reader and instead post the article I should have months ago.</p>

<p>Inbox Zero is not a rule detailing the number of emails you are allowed to have in your inbox, but a philosophy for governing the number of things allowed to occupy your time and attention. The inbox, from which this ideology got its name, was simply the most obvious situation in which the doctrine that eventually evolved in to Inbox Zero applied, and thus the name was derived. Inbox Zero is much more than a simple way to manage your email: it&#8217;s a way of life, a mantra Merlin conjured to give those of us inundated by things inessential to our survival and detrimental to our well being a recourse.</p>

<p>There is no magic here, just good, old-fashioned common sense. And there&#8217;s nothing mythical about that.</p>

<p>This was a difficult piece for me to write because my feelings regarding academic writing are so conflicting. On the one hand, I view academic writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;by which I mean the type of writing taught in American schools&#160;&#8212;&#160;as a certain boon: it introduces kids to the writer&#8217;s craft, teaches young writers how to write, and provides an introduction to organizing and conveying thoughts and ideas in a coherent and orderly fashion. On the other hand though, I also feel it is very restrictive: beholden to the five-paragraph format, I feel much more better writing would come of less severe restrictions. And this is totally ignoring the morass that is citations in academic writing, a topic I discussed at length in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/citational-fallacy.html"><em>Citational Fallacy</em></a>.</p>

<p>Despite my conflicting thoughts on the topic, at the end of the day I had to pick a side, and the side I chose was against rather than for; anti- instead of pro-. For most, academic writing will server as their one and only experience with the writer&#8217;s craft, and for most, that experience will be poor. If the only topics I wrote about in school were essays on To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, and what I did the previous summer, and the only feedback I ever got on those papers told me that I needed to place two spaces after each paragraph, I can guarantee the longest piece of prose I would ever write for the rest of my life would be a to-do list. Unfortunately, this is the case for a dispiriting number of people.</p>

<p>A great writer can tell a great story in five paragraphs, but it will be dry and predictable&#160;&#8212;&#160;not to mention short. Taken outside of the academic setting, who would want to read such a manuscript? The best written works of our time are the sprawling manuscripts made popular by the bloggers who abandoned the format they were taught in school; the superlative writings of our day come from those who struck out on their own. In the previous generation, a select few tossed the rules to the side and created the web as we know it today, full to metaphorically bursting with wonderful works of prose. How many more would have chosen a similar path had they not been forced to endure the five paragraph essay?</p>

<p>After all, the well only need be poisoned once; after that, no one will ever drink from it again.</p>

<p>Virtually every time Dan Benjamin is interviewed, the host eventually asks the same question posed by numerous interviewers of days gone by: &#8220;When people ask what you do, what do you tell them?&#8221; And every time, Dan answers the same way, saying that his answer depends on the person asking. For some, Dan responds that he is in broadcasting and leaves it at that; in other cases he goes in to more detail, qualifying that statement by describing his podcast network. He chooses his answer based on the level to which that person would understand his explanation, because as Dan has said each time in response to the aforementioned question, there are some people that still don&#8217;t know what podcasts are.</p>

<p>Depending on the interviewer, at this point the conversation occasionally shifts gear as the pair reminisce of days gone by when making a living as a writer for a blog was unheard of. Those involved in the podcasting industry are very much in the same boat those writers were a few years ago: then, to say one made a living writing on the web raised more than a few eyebrows; the same is true for podcasters today, whereas the novelty of a career writing outside of a print publication has lessened significantly. Lessened, but not disappeared.</p>

<p>A few days ago in a casual conversation with a friend who recently learned of my blog, he asked if I had been posting my daily rants lately. His question caught me off-guard. In the circles I travel in, among those who make their living online writing, podcasting, and programming, such a question would be absurd; a few years ago, maybe; a year ago, maybe, but no one, especially those intending to form any sort of readership, writes like that anymore.</p>

<p>My intent in writing this is not to in any way belittle his intelligence&#160;&#8212;&#160;he is an extremely smart individual I have a great amount of respect for&#160;&#8212;&#160;but to serve as a reminder and just a bit of perspective. As we move amongst our circles of bloggers, podcasters, and programmers, the temptation to assume the rest of the world is just a short ways behind us has become curiously widespread. That prevalence does not, however, in any way mean it should be taken for granted. But go ahead, rant at me if you disagree.</p>

<p>Two interesting anecdotes showing a different, less praiseworthy side of Steve Jobs. The man was not perfect, as many purported him to be in the sad hours following his death, but a mere mortal not just like the rest of us, but human nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;He made himself so fearful and terrible that an entire group of amazing, talented, hard working people, ended up getting screamed at wrongfully. It was his fault that the MobileMe launch went so poorly, not ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>After reading this article, I went back and forth trying to decide whether or not I should link to it. The piece was not particularly remarkable in any way, after all. Regardless of how I justified not writing about it though, I kept coming back to this story until I eventually gave in. It&#8217;s a touching story tinged with the melancholy undertone of existential ennui. Having spent months away from home multiple times in the past, I can empathize with the the author&#8217;s sentiment.</p>

<p>In the past I have written one article about women and equality, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-crying-shame.html"><em>A Crying Shame</em></a>. I am quite proud of that article. So much so, in fact, that unlike many of the other topics I rehash here, I have felt no need to write anything more on the subject. I did feel pushed to at least mention the article linked at the head of this post, however, especially after listening to what I seem to recall was episode #114 of Back to Work a few weeks ago. In <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/114">I&#8217;m Moving to FudgePacker</a>, Merlin Mann talked about misconstrued statistics and how improper representations of inaccurate statistics can lead to incorrect conclusions on important issues when in actuality, maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;it isn&#8217;t quite as bad as everyone likes to stand up and claim it to be.</p>

<p>Merlin&#8217;s example chronicled a previous discussion with a woman advocating equality in the tech sector. She argued citing a statistic claiming that women receive, on average, a significantly smaller salary than their male counterparts. In response, Merlin asked whether she or any of her female co-workers experienced this disproportionality; she responded that none had. He also pointed out that in citing an average, by definition an equal number of people receiving a salary greater than the average must also receive a salary smaller than the average, and that the difference in those amounts must be the same. In other words, if on average women are paid 75<code> of the wages given to their male co-workers, for example, and within this sample group of women they are all paid 100</code> of the wages given to their male counterparts, it follows that in order for the statistic to be accurate, some women, somewhere, must be receiving 25<code> less than the average, or 50</code> of the wages allocated to their male counterparts. And really&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this was his ultimate point&#160;&#8212;&#160;is this actually happening anywhere?</p>

<p>But back to Rae Hoffman&#8217;s article, the piece that got me started down this rabbit trail:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Of course, some people look at the lineup and immediately assume highly talented women are being &#8216;excluded&#8217;. Of course, they don&#8217;t know that for a fact. For all they know, 95<code> of speaker pitches came from men and thus why they ended up with a 95</code> male speaker line up once they whittled down the list to the best pitches.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I first came across this article a few weeks ago while browsing Less Wrong, Eliezer Yudkowsky&#8217;s chronicle struck me as the perfect example illustrating the importance of a number of different things, primary of which was the significance of asking the right question. Alongside this topic the author also touched on the value of keeping an open mind, possessing a willingness to abandon pre-conceived notions when presented with new evidence, and arguing in univocal terms. It&#8217;s long, but a very well-written and thought-provoking piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the mid-1800s, there were thousands of unique varieties of apples in the United States, some of the most astounding diversity ever developed in a food crop. Then industrial agriculture crushed that world. The apple industry settled on a handful of varieties to promote worldwide, and the rest were forgotten. They became commercially extinct&#160;&#8212;&#160;but not quite biologically extinct.&#8221;</p>

<p>A nice change of pace from the usual; a delightful article well worth the read.</p>

<p>Back when John Siracusa published <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/02/24/annoyance-driven-development"><em>Annoyance-Driven Development</em></a> in the tail-end of February, and amidst the <a href="http://curiousrat.com/annoyance-driven-blog-posts">discussion</a> that <a href="http://wanderingcoder.net/2013/04/02/annoyance-driven-blogging/">ensued</a>, I felt that I had nothing to add to the conversation and thus had no need to link to the piece. I still feel that way, but the idea that annoyance could affect change in the world&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether in the form of the development of a particular technology or, as in the case of this article, the advent of a blog post&#160;&#8212;&#160;invariably stuck with me.</p>

<p>Every time Ben Brooks posts a new article, my feed reader updates and shows me a short snippet from the first paragraph. For each article, that snippet is the same. It starts with, &#8220;This feed is delayed by seven days....&#8221;, and then continues with the article after the short disclaimer informing every single reader, every single time he or she previews an item in their feed reader of choice, that the feed is delayed by seven days, and to remove this message one must merely become a member for a small monthly fee. This happens for each and every item Ben posts. Every single time. If I have not made my annoyance quite clear yet, let me make it obvious: for every article I see this in, I grimace. I have read the same preview for months, and it grates on me for each and every piece to which it is the preluding snippet. And that would be every single one, with the exception of the occasional &#8220;Quote of the Day&#8221; posts.</p>

<p>I get that Ben has to advertise the benefits of becoming a member and this is certainly a very effective way of doing so while simultaneously providing his readers with a tangible incentive, as evidenced by my frustration articulated above, but at what cost? This annoyance breeds distaste and ultimately I find myself glossing over his articles, unwilling to take the extra time required to find out exactly what any given piece is about.</p>

<p>I realize this is a trivial thing I&#8217;m making a big deal of, but it is a trivial thing that bugs me, and I&#8217;m sure I am not the only one.</p>

<p>Every time I post an article, I shamelessly submit it to Hacker News in the hopes that it will get picked up and generate a significant amount of attention and traffic to my site. Somewhere in the back of my mind, every time I submit something I wrote to Hacker News I think, &#8220;Maybe this is the one, the article that will go viral, and tomorrow I&#8217;ll see John Gruber post about it and hear Dan and Haddie talk about it on The Frequency. Maybe...&#8221; But that never happens.</p>

<p>Pursuant of this goal and in the face of my past &#8220;failures&#8221;, to use a bit of a strong word, I have to decide, each time I write a piece, whether to use a somewhat witty title or an overly-explanatory &#8220;linkbait&#8221; title. Each time I am faced with this decision though, the same arguments pop up in my mind: linkbait titles don&#8217;t drive the kind of traffic I want to attract. More importantly though, there&#8217;s a line that I don&#8217;t want to cross. I don&#8217;t want to be another blog clamoring for attention with a sensationalistic title on a tired topic with my nuanced opinion attached at the bottom. I want to be the blog people are excited to see new content coming from. And those kinds of blogs don&#8217;t post those kinds of titles; those bloggers battle against linkbait each and every day with each and every article, and they win.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-04-19 17:47:58-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-04.html">04</a>/19 17:47:58 EST</time>
<p>In a Merlin Mann, Inbox Zero-esq fashion, I do my best to carefully limit the number of things allowed to compete for my attention. Although I regularly fall far short of this goal in most areas of my life, I do a relatively good job when it comes to the news I read and the writers I follow on the internet. While one could certainly make the argument against Hacker News as a news source with any rhyme or reason, that single exception aside the rest of the content I consume on a daily basis comes to me through a carefully curated RSS stream. Outside of Hacker News and those RSS feeds primarily aggregating the content of one-man-shop bloggers, I do not follow any other news outlets. I do not follow CNN, Fox, Time, or The Washington Post. I don&#8217;t read the local newspaper, the national one, or any other print publication I could reliably hide behind. I don&#8217;t watch the news whenever I can help it; after sitting through a feature on the egregious and all-too-common problem of using too much laundry detergent, I see little point in taking the effort to turn the TV on and change the channel. I don&#8217;t even turn the radio on anymore. And while this approach certainly has some advantages&#160;&#8212;&#160;every day I am presented with a relatively low number of articles and news stories, fewer of the articles I encounter are poorly written and uninteresting, and as a result of those two benefits I rarely experience a shortage of good reading material&#160;&#8212;&#160;it has its fair share of disadvantages as well.</p>

<p>For one, the news I encounter through these channels is not only a very unrepresentative example of the important events going on in the world today, I would even go so far as to characterize it as sanitized: I only see what I want to see, and the most horrifying thing I encounter on a nearly daily basis is the release of yet another outrageously sized Samsung &#8220;phone&#8221;. Talk abut first-world problems. But Samsung&#8217;s crimes against humanity are not the focus of this post.</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned pros and cons is one more result I had trouble categorizing, the intended topic of this post: the implied importance of every single thing I read. From my manicured news stream, I further sterilize it by selecting every potentially interesting article I encounter and then sending those pieces to Instapaper. After so many steps and filters, these carefully selected articles populating my Instapaper queue carry with them this implied importance, asking to be read and scrutinized in search of the author&#8217;s single salient, intelligent point that will make me sit back in my chair and ponder his or her words for a while. On top of that, I often feel the need to make a post, however brief, mentioning every article I save to Instapaper. After all, those pieces are the best of the best. It would be an unfortunate oversight not to spend a nontrivial amount of time extracting an intelligent pull-quote and writing a few brief sentences about those articles, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the question I posed myself earlier today, and the question I ignored before posting <em>Chasing the Right Zero</em>. I had nothing to add to the discussion surrounding that piece, I didn&#8217;t even think it was that great, but I nevertheless felt that I <em>had</em> to write about it, if for nothing else than because somewhere in that short piece there was something exceedingly meaningful and I was just missing it, when in actuality I was merely continuing a long habit of searching for meaning in yet another article in which there was none.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me, the real &#8216;zero&#8217; in Inbox Zero is more about consciously managing the amount of our attention that we commit (or, far more often, cede) to thinking and worrying about what may or may not be piling up while we&#8217;re away doing the real work of our lives. Which is to say: the Real Work that&#8217;s not, in this instance, about fiddling with email or drearily suffering the daily fusillade of random requests and information bombs that get lobbed our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Android and the Fiber business and even Facebook fit into this analogy rather well. In this context more rainfall means more people using the Internet. If you have more people you&#8217;ll have more rivers and you&#8217;ll have more water and hopefully more fish. Fiber means the water will flow more rapidly: you&#8217;re essentially dredging the riverbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some wonder why Google still pushes Android despite failing to make a significant profit from it, especially when compared to Samsung; some wonder why Google chose to begin providing Fiber to select American cities; some wonder, and Horace Dediu, on episode #79 of Critical Path, very eloquently explained the reasoning behind these and many other decisions. A characteristically excellent episode I suggest everyone listen to at least once, and then again to absorb any glossed over brilliance you may have missed the first time around.</p>

<p>Sites like Less Wrong exist <em>because</em> it&#8217;s hard for those contributors, inarguably highly intelligent, to bring attention to their work through other venues. We often tout Twitter, YouTube to an extent, and a flourishing blogging community as the epitome of ease, enabling those with good ideas and smart things to say to develop a personal brand and get their content to the masses. But that&#8217;s not really true, is it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Apple pessimism is even stronger. No matter what they release and no matter how well it sells, they won&#8217;t win over the press, the pundits, the stock market, or the rhetoric. Not this year. They could release a revolutionary 60-inch 4K TV for $99 with built-in nanobots to assemble and dispense free smartwatches, and people would complain that it should cost $49 and the nanobots aren&#8217;t open enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one wants to think of themselves as a Luddite, which is part of what makes technological conservatism so insidious. It can color the thinking of the nerdiest among us, even as we use the latest hardware and software and keep up with all the important tech news. The certainty of our own tech savvy can blind us to future possibilities and lead us to reject anything that deviates from the status quo. We are not immune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps not necessarily a representative sample of this great article by John Siracusa, I nevertheless chose this quotation from the piece reminiscent of the Hypercritical episodes of days since passed because, like John&#8217;s epic rants of old, it was just too good to let pass without note or comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your job? You pick up the freshest, most interesting coffee from tiny roasters who do not drop ship (and of varieties not listed online from bigger roasters) and send them by request to customers around the world. Your customers trust you as a reporter and pay a small premium to have access to the strange diversity that surrounds you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I came across a video made by Duncan Elms called <a href="http://vimeo.com/63502573">&#8220;Bitcoin Explained&#8221;</a>. Curious, I decided to check it out. Rather than the information contined within it, it was instead the actual video that greatly impressed me. Not only informative but also extremely well done, Duncan Elms&#8217; videos are all very impressive.</p>

<p>The first time I watched <em>Bitcoin Explained</em>, I watched it on my phone as I browsed through my news feeds over lunch. When I started looking for the video on my computer, I came across two more outstanding videos. The first, <a href="http://vimeo.com/34234286">Shutter Island</a>, is a short film chronicling Raphael Nussbaum and Iwan Bigler&#8217;s fifteen-day trip exploring Switzerland and Iceland. They took some amazing photographs and videos, and put them together into a beautiful video. In a similar vein to Shutter Island, the second video I came across, <a href="http://vimeo.com/62831216">Teton Gravity Research&#8217;s Aerial Reel</a>, also featured surreal videos capturing the beauty of The Bay Area in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>Almost three months ago today, I titled an article <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/aaron-swartz.html"><em>We Have Lost One of Our Own</em></a> and posted it to this site. I gathered some of the more salient and insightful pieces posted in the wake of Aaron Swartz&#8217;s death, and wrote an article about unjust punishment and piracy. I try not to do this very often, but I will make an exception here and include an excerpt from one of my own posts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Aaron Swartz is the latest casualty in this abhorrent, excessive, and ineffective exertion of power. This time though, unlike all the last, the prize claimed was not monetary, but the priceless life of a young individual. But hey, those scientific journals, reportedly worth millions according to the prosecutors via Lawrence Lessig&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least they are safe. At least. They. Are. Safe.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My post was tinged with sorrow and melancholy, as every other article published at the time was, and flavored with a righteous anger. Contrast this with my words from just shy of a month later in an article titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/enough-already.html"><em>Enough, already</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With a topic such as this and words such as Tom&#8217;s, many will likely label him as insensitive and brusque. Think for a minute though, before writing a very strongly-worded tweet from the vantage point granted by your lofty pedestal, that Aaron Swartz might not have been the saintly do-gooder everyone describes him to be or the martyr we seem to be searching for so desperately. Maybe, just maybe, he was a cowardly child afraid of facing the consequences of his actions, someone that through some twisted reasoning though it acceptable to kill himself and allow one of the few people he loved to find his body suspended from the ceiling. Maybe, just maybe, Tom is right.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2013/02/enough-already/">Tom Negrino</a> was few up with the sanctification of the man; I was few up with the sanctification of the man. I drew a bit of flack in the form of comments for this post, but of the three individuals who deigned to comment, only one disagreed with me.</p>

<p>The entire event never sat well with me, and this morning, as some Hacker News poster linked to Aaron Swartz&#8217;s last video interview, I finally decided to say something about it. For all the eulogization, crying, and fruitless calls to action; for all the people who were <em>so</em> hurt, <em>so</em> disappointed in our judicial system, and <em>so</em> angry; for all the people whose lives Aaron Swartz touched either directly or indirectly&#160;&#8212;&#160;for all that, I find it almost funny that absolutely nothing changed. Three months later, no one is talking about it anymore: there are no angry blog posts calling someone&#8217;s removal from public office, no petitions, and no more eulogies pontificating reform of one degree of another. There is nothing, and we have all moved on.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-04-10 09:37:30-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-04.html">04</a>/10 09:37:30 EST</time>
<p>Probably nothing; I can hope though, and I hope to see Apple add a second tier.</p>

<p>With the release of iTunes Match Apple managed to capture recurring revenue from previously-purchased music, regardless of where that music came from and at what time it was purchased. The move was, and still is, brilliant. Since that release nearly two years ago I have given Apple forty dollars for the continued use of iTunes Match, another example illustrating the genius behind the idea: Apple made a customer of me, someone who otherwise would not have contributed even a fraction of that forty dollars to the iTunes revenue statement. I did not start writing this article strictly to praise Apple though; I began writing it to propose the next logical move.</p>

<p>When my subscription to iTunes Match comes up for renewal in October, I will shell out another twenty dollars to Apple in exchange for another twelve months of iTunes Match. In all likelihood, I will continue to do this well in to the future, as I am sure many others will too. No matter how you look at it, iTunes Match is a very stable source of recurring revenue, albeit a small one. Which brings me to my proposition: add a second tier to iTunes Match for an increased annual fee that would allow subscribers to download even higher quality, 320kbps versions of their music. Audiophiles, rejoice.</p>

<p>Realistically, this new offering would not provide any noticeable increase in sound quality; realistically, the only increase subscribers of this new, second tier could consistently and un-qualitatively experience would be much greater file sizes, and very few will be excited at that prospect. But there would still be some nontrivial number that do subscribe for twenty-five, thirty, or possibly even thirty-five dollars&#160;&#8212;&#160;as the price of this second tier approaches forty dollars I become increasingly circumspect that any significant number of people would find the tradeoff worthy&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the company will make close to twice as much money on those individuals than they do already.</p>

<p>In my mind, this scenario is very similar to the announcement of the 128GB iPad 4: a small number of people will buy one, an even smaller portion actually require the ridiculous storage space, the cost to produce these devices will be a negligible increase over the other iPad models, and Apple will make a killing on and every each sale. Adding a second tier to iTunes Match would allow Apple to address the underserved audiophile market who now rely on CDs to obtain 320kbps tracks. Like the aforementioned iPad model, few would actually subscribe, even fewer would use the service to its full potential either knowingly or simply for lack of storage space, incurred costs would be negligible&#160;&#8212;&#160;after all, it&#8217;s not as if Apple does not have access to these tracks, it merely does not currently have a motive to make them available&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the company would make a killing off of each subscriber.</p>

<p>And if simply offering high-quality versions of already-matched songs is not enough of an incentive to attract new users and entice existing subscribers to upgrade, what about enabling song metadata replacement? The mere existence of Music Brainz Picard and iTunes Match Tagger, to name two of the more popular services and my personal favorites for the job, obviate the need for such a service. And given that Apple already accurately identifies the majority of the music in my library for iTunes Match and already replaces the files on my computer, the addition of this feature should be relatively easy.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the genius of these two ideas, if I may toot my own horn for a moment: both inarguably major new features would piggyback on existing architecture. Distributing high-quality versions of already-matched songs would be as easy as flipping the bit limiting the bitrate cap from 256kbps to 320kbps; as I said earlier, it&#8217;s not as if Apple does not have access to these songs, it merely does not have any reason to make them publicly available. Similarly, replacing existing metadata with correct information would be as easy as refusing to store a song&#8217;s existing metadata before replacing the local file with the iTunes version.</p>

<p>Looking from the outside in, neither of these features appear to be particularly difficult to implement; the only question, then, is whether or not Apple will choose to further this product; and if so, when?</p>

<p>I have always had an interesting&#160;&#8212;&#160;if not unique&#160;&#8212;&#160;mentality when it comes to money. Rather than a thing to be desired, I have always considered money merely a means to an end. The physical thing is only worth possessing inasmuch as it allows me to do fun and enjoyable things with people I like. When I take my girlfriend out for dinner, I don&#8217;t see the twenty dollars I spend on a meal as the loss of that money; I see that twenty dollars as paying for a delightful evening spent with a girl I enjoy being with and really like. Or consider the days I take my siblings to the frozen yogurt shop down the street from my house. One of the last times I took them, my sister tried to pay. It was a nice gesture and good that she did, but it is not her responsibility, at twelve, to pay for her own food; I was there and fully capable of buying our yogurt, which I did. I exchanged somewhere in the ballpark of ten dollars for a delicious bowl of frozen yogurt with my sister. I did not lose that money; to me, it was an acceptable trade in which I certainly got the better part of the deal.</p>

<p>Now, I realize that this is a fanciful and impractical way to consider money, and this mantra is not, by any means, applicable in every circumstance. I could not justify an expensive trip with this mentality, for example, by saying that the experiences I will have while on it are worth the money if doing so would cause me to shirk my duties in some other area of my life; no, for major commitments, large expenditures, this is not necessarily the best mentality to have. That does not mean it is inapplicable though, at least in part, in more places than you might at first think.</p>

<p><em>Hi, can I axe you a question? Ever made a blog at WordPress, Blogger? How about Tumblr or Squarespace? Before you answer, Hi.</em></p>

<p>A week or two ago an old friend asked if I could make a website for her. I asked the usual questions: what was it for? What did she want it to look like? When did she need it finished? Had she considered a hosted solution like Squarespace or Tumblr, or did she want to manage the server herself? To the question regarding potential hosts, no, she had not even heard of Squarespace or Tumblr; she had, on the other hand, prior experience with Google&#8217;s blogging platform Blogger. Unfortunately, that is what she eventually chose, much to my chagrin.</p>

<p>I have used all the major blogging platforms at one time or another in the past, and systematically tossed each to the side for any number of shortcomings. The primary reason I still choose to roll my own setup, however, does not stem from any of these shortcomings easily overcome with a bit of tinkering, but instead from an innate and long-held aversion to outsourcing such an important facet of my site to a third party. Not because I distrust Squarespace though&#160;&#8212;&#160;on the contrary, I would prefer to give them my money instead of paying a comparable amount to Host Gator each month for vastly inferior service and a ridiculous number of artificial limits&#160;&#8212;&#160;but because I don&#8217;t want the two people that come to this site every day to find <em>another</em> stock blog template slapped around my content, no matter how good that template may look. Yes, I realize I can customize almost every aspect of a Squarespace blog template; no, I do not have the time, energy, nor motivation to do so, especially with a fully-functioning site up and running already.</p>

<p>But even that is not the entire reason I still opt out of Squarespace and the like: I continue to design and build my own sites because on some level, I view sites created on blogging platforms as somewhat inferior to custom-built ones due to the mere fact that the author deigned not to devote a significant amount of time to learning the skills required to design and build an attractive website. I realize this belief is farcical; I realize this belief is fanciful. Nevertheless, I cannot change the fact that every time I come to a stock WordPress or&#160;&#8212;&#160;God forbid&#160;&#8212;&#160;Blogger site, the first thought that runs through my mind is not one of interest in the content or whimsical layout, but a slight feeling of disappointment.</p>

<p>When I wrote my first article about Reeder, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/drafts-and-reeder.html"><em>Changing my Workflow with Drafts and Reeder</em></a>, I highlighted its lack of reliance on Google Reader as one of the main reasons I chose to go with the RSS app. That was a factually incorrect statement; however, with <a href="https://twitter.com/reederapp/status/317001614873489408">this announcement</a>, Reeder&#8217;s creator Silvio Rizzi announced that the popular iOS RSS reader would add Feedbin support in the very near future, thus ending its reliance on Google Reader. I realize Reeder supports Fever and Readability as well, but this is nevertheless great news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagine a future society that flees into a vast underground network of caverns and seals the entrances.  We shall not specify whether they flee disease, war, or radiation; we shall suppose the first Undergrounders manage to grow food, find water, recycle air, make light, and survive, and that their descendants thrive and eventually form cities.  Of the world above, there are only legends written on scraps of paper; and one of these scraps of paper describes the sky, a vast open space of air above a great unbounded floor.  The sky is cerulean in color, and contains strange floating objects like enormous tufts of white cotton.  But the meaning of the word &#8221;cerulean&#8220; is controversial; some say that it refers to the color known as &#8216;blue&#8217;, and others that it refers to the color known as &#8216;green&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fantastic narrative from Eliezer Yudkowsky writing over at Less Wrong. Not merely about science and politics though, as the title suggests, but about human nature, hatred, and progress as well.</p>

<p>I just flew home after three months in Minnesota. The TSA agents at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul airport in Minnesota were <em>delightful</em>: the man at the end of the security line checking my ID and boarding pass joked with me as I went through; the agent on the other side of the body scanner couldn&#8217;t have been nicer. Then, as I was trying to find my gate on my boarding pass and undoubtedly looking quite confused, a TSA agent that happened to be walking by stopped and asked if I needed any help. She didn&#8217;t have to stop; she could have kept on walking, but she didn&#8217;t, and for that I was very grateful despite not needing her assistance.</p>

<p>While everyone complains about the TSA over and over again in what has become an unceasing din, I thought I would share this brief observation. Just so we can have a bit of perspective in this issue.</p>

<p>As I was reading <a href="http://www.elasticspace.com/2013/03/no-to-no-ui"><em>No to NoUI</em></a> earlier, an article ostensibly regarding the state of user interfaces today, Timo Arnall&#8217;s description of &#8220;the cloud&#8221; stuck with me more than anything else from the article. That&#8217;s why, even though I should have picked a more representative sample, I ended up using that as my excerpt when I linked to the piece. Foolhardy or not, I chose this paragraph above all the others:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We already have plenty of thinking that celebrates the invisibility and seamlessness of technology. We are overloaded with childish mythologies like &#8216;the cloud&#8217;; a soft, fuzzy metaphor for enormous infrastructural projects of undersea cables and power-hungry data farms. This mythology can be harmful and is often just plain wrong. Networks go down, hard disks fail, sensors fail to sense, processors overheat and batteries die.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, between checking the smoker, I read Ben Popper&#8217;s piece on The Verge titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/2/4170256/bioshock-infinite-making-great-art-from-americas-racist-past-and"><em>&#8216;BioShock Infinite&#8217; makes great art from America&#8217;s racist past and political present</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In BioShock Infinite, the creators again present a funhouse mirror of American ideological history. Comstock the Prophet and the citizens of the floating city of Columbia meld strains of religious fervor, anti-government rhetoric, jingoistic nationalism, and a twisted worship of the founding fathers, all carefully lifted from historical events at the turn of the 20th century, but simultaneously satirizing the Tea Party movement that has roiled our politics for the last six years.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than the discussion debating whether video games are, in fact, art or the interesting fact that rather than pretending brutal racism never existed as we are wont to do these days the creators of Bioshock Infinite embraced this nation&#8217;s complicated history, I put my phone down after reading the article extremely impressed with the quality of the piece. Ben did something very difficult for many writers: he put these intensely personal thoughts and feelings in to writing, and he did so extremely well.</p>

<p>After reading Ben&#8217;s piece, as I thought about the wonderful article I had just read, I realized I was finding these gems in the strangest of places: in an article about interface design, I came across a great characterization of &#8220;the cloud&#8221;; and in an article about gaming, I found a fantastic work of prose.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the one hand, I worry that Pixar is making too many sequels. On the other, I&#8217;d love to see another Incredibles movie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone, somewhere, once said something to the effect of the higher the number the less-good the sequel. Certainly there are some exceptions to that rule&#160;&#8212;&#160;Toy Story, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;but by and large it has proved a valid hypothesis. Take Cars 2: as much as I wanted to love that movie after the first, I couldn&#8217;t do it. An endless number of examples and counter-examples could be made on both sides of this argument, but I, for one, look forward to anything with Pixar&#8217;s name on it, regardless of whether or not a digit follows it.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-04-02 16:18:58-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-04.html">04</a>/02 16:18:58 EST</time>
<p>A few weeks ago I came across Zite after having it recommended to me as a great way to discover interesting news in an environment capable of intelligently determining the kinds of content to serve its users based on their reading habits. More interesting than the actual content though, which I found consistently uninteresting and commonplace, I grew especially attached to the gesture-based interface: on the main screen swiping to the right switches between news categories, and swiping left moves back in the stack; in individual articles, swiping to the right brings me back to the main screen. And that&#8217;s only in the iOS app: in the iPad version, swiping to the left and right moves through a tiled interface of news stories; swiping up or down on a single item designates it as an item of interest whose kind I would like to see more of or an article whose type I want to read less of, respectively. Although few and not particularly significant, these gestures, once learned, felt so natural and commonsensical that I found myself fumbling in my other apps, only to be confounded by the lack of gesture support. Especially in my then-RSS reader Feedler and Instapaper, where I do the majority of my reading on my iOS devices.</p>

<p>On a larger scale, the gestures enabled on the iPad&#160;&#8212;&#160;four-finger swipe to the left and right to switch apps according to their order in the launchpad, four-finger swipe up to reveal the launchpad, and five-finger pinch to reveal the home screen&#160;&#8212;&#160;have proved especially useful to me, and are much more widely applicable than those offered only in Zite. And that&#8217;s disregarding the universal downward swipe to reveal the notification center available regardless of the app or whether I am using my iPhone or iPad.</p>

<p>Thankfully, gesture support is not limited to the operating system. Reeder, the popular RSS reading app <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/reeder-and-drafts.html">I switched to after learning of Google&#8217;s plan to shutter Reader</a>, supports gestures in its iPhone app, though not in the iPad version. Chrome also supports a number of gestures, many of which I find myself using every time I open the app. Drafts, my current favorite cross-platform writing app, also uses gestures to greatly simplify the user interface and streamline the user experience. Similarly, Tweetbot makes excellent use of gestures to simply its interface and boost the user experience.</p>

<p>Given the significant mileage I get out of the built-in iOS gestures and those enabled in my favorite apps, I often find myself frustrated by the lack of support for those or similar gestures in other apps, or a particular gesture I feel would be especially useful system-wide. I would love to see a five-finger spread gesture implemented in iOS, for example, to go from the home screen to the first app in the launchpad as the opposite of the five-finger pinch gesture, which mimics the functionality of the home button on the iPad. Or in Instapaper, to use an individual app as an example, I would love to see the option enabling swipe to return to the main screen on by default; prior to writing this article I had no idea that such a feature existed, and I missed it sorely.</p>

<p>Unfortunately though, arguments against building in gesture support are in no short supply: many users, unable to intuit the existence of this type of functionality or accurately predict its effects, would likely excuse their lack of understanding as erratic behavior in the app. To combat this problem many developers have included guides designed to educate users as to the capabilities of the app, but these have been widely condemned as the mark of a failed user interface. We have placed an artificial barrier in front of developers, impeding their progress in this area for the sake of those unable or unwilling&#160;&#8212;&#160;or both&#160;&#8212;&#160;to step forward and match the pace of progress in this industry.</p>

<p>Not without good reason, I am afraid to admit: while gestures can be used to improve the entire experience, a downside does certainly exist. It is not all that uncommon for me to find myself sliding my finger across my iPhone&#8217;s screen three, four, or five times attempting to trigger the gesture to return to the main feed window in Reeder, for example, or to forget which direction I should swipe to expand a single tweet in Tweetbot and which direction I swipe to view the entire conversation. Gestures can be confusing and frustrating&#160;&#8212;&#160;I will admit that. I will, however, leave you with this: given the inelegant alternative&#160;&#8212;&#160;for there really is only one alternative, buttons&#160;&#8212;&#160;which is the less of the two evils?</p>

<p>My preference always has been and always will be to choose gestures over buttons. I can only hope that with time, this hope will be realized in a much better and more widespread manner than it is now. Until then though, I&#8217;ll be content to swipe between apps and paw at the screen, like an animal.</p>

<p>At first I glossed over Timo Arnall&#8217;s piece <a href="http://www.elasticspace.com/2013/03/no-to-no-ui"><em>No to NoUI</em></a>, finding little interest in a discussion of user interfaces and its proponents&#8217; nuances. After a steady climb towards the top spot on Hacker News though I added it to Instapaper, as I am wont to do for articles attracting this level of attention regardless of the topic. Rather than a meandering or pragmatic discussion regarding design in the most touchy-feely manner possible, though, I found, to my surprise, an interesting piece discussing the far-reaching and unobvious effects user interfaces have on our every day lives and the detrimental effects a future in which the user interface is invisible would bring&#160;&#8212;&#160;a discussion that also encompassed the importance of good design. A very interesting piece well worth the read, even if you have no interest in design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We already have plenty of thinking that celebrates the invisibility and seamlessness of technology. We are overloaded with childish mythologies like &#8216;the cloud&#8217;; a soft, fuzzy metaphor for enormous infrastructural projects of undersea cables and power-hungry data farms. This mythology can be harmful and is often just plain wrong. Networks go down, hard disks fail, sensors fail to sense, processors overheat and batteries die.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also of great interest to me was the piece referenced in passing at the beginning of Timo Arnall&#8217;s second section explaining how naturality is often used as an excuse for the absence of design, the <a href="http://journal.benbashford.com/post/2848763029">article by Ben Bashford on giving technology personality and behavior</a> and how such a step would change the paradigm. Although posted more than two years ago, Ben&#8217;s article is no less applicable or interesting today than it undoubtedly was when he originally published the piece.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-04-01 11:05:03-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-04.html">04</a>/01 11:05:03 EST</time>
<p>Created in 2003, <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a> was originally the brainchild of a single developer: <em>titler</em>. However, after his prolonged absence from the project beginning in May of 2006, Rodney Hester and Chris Long began developing a release of HandBrake supporting the H.264 video codec. Although they made significant advances in stability, interface design, and functionality, they were unable to submit their modified version of HandBrake without the consent of the original creator. Unable to officially commit their revisions as a new version, the two developers created a new project named MediaFork based on the latest release of HandBrake, 0.7.1 at the time. Then, on February 13, 2007, <em>titler</em> resurfaced and contacted Hester and Long. <em>titler</em> expressed his support for their project and encouraged them to continue development. Following the exchange, plans were made to reintegrate MediaFork into the main HandBrake build. And so, in the ensuing version, MediaFork&#8217;s code was integrated into HandBrake&#8217;s. At the time of this writing HandBrake is in version 0.9.8, released July 18th, 2012.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t let the goofy, pineapple-and-margarita logo fool you: despite its whimsical emblem, HandBrake is regarded as one of the most powerful video conversion applications available. Through the excellent combination of a streamlined interface and extensive control, HandBrake has become increasingly popular amongst video enthusiasts around the world. However, HandBrake&#8217;s power comes at the price of simplicity: this is not the easiest program available for the task it accomplishes. Due to that, and the fact that there are few comprehensive guides out there, I decided to write this article in order to provide you with the knowledge to utilize HandBrake to its full potential. The result, this article, contains an explanation of every checkbox, text field, and radio button found in HandBrake.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="GettingStarted">Getting Started<span>&nbsp;<a href="#GettingStarted">#</a></span></h3>
<p>HandBrake is relatively easy to install and setup. First, go to <a href="http://HandBrake.fr/downloads.php">the Downloads page</a> and download the version of HandBrake for your operating system. Currently there are versions of HandBrake for Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. Additionally, you can also opt for the Command Line Interface version should you so desire. Once the installer has downloaded, start it and complete the three-step installation process. HandBrake is now installed on your system.</p>

<p>Before you can begin learning about the interface and converting videos though, an output directory must be specified. The default output directory is the location HandBrake will automatically store output videos once a conversion has finished. HandBrake can also be configured to store copies of the respective video&#8217;s log file in this location rather than in the <em>logs</em> directory as is the default. To set a default output directory, open the Tools menu, scroll down to Options, and click it. The HandBrake Options window will pop up containing six tabs. These six tabs&#160;&#8212;&#160;General, Output Files, Preview, Audio and Subtitles, System and Logging, and Advanced&#160;&#8212;&#160;allow you to set some of HandBrake&#8217;s environment variables such as the destination folder, done in the &#8220;Output Files&#8221; tab by clicking the Browse button near the &#8220;Default Path&#8221; label. Once you have selected an appropriate directory, click Close to save your setting and close the Options screen. You are now ready to begin learning to use HandBrake.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="HandBrakesInterface">HandBrake's Interface<span>&nbsp;<a href="#HandBrakesInterface">#</a></span></h3>
<p>HandBrake&#8217;s interface is split into seven distinct sections. In order of appearance, these sections are as follows: the menu bar, positioned at the top of the window; the button bar, containing six buttons for HandBrake&#8217;s six main functions as well as the Help button; Source; Destination; Output Settings, containing the seven conversion tabs; and Presets, located at the right of the window. Throughout the rest of this article, each interface item and its child elements will be discussed in exhaustive detail.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheMenuBar">The Menu Bar<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheMenuBar">#</a></span></h4>
<p>The menu bar houses two menus: File and Tools. The File menu simply allows you to close HandBrake, whereas Tools contains thee items: Show Queue, Activity Window, and Options. Show Queue causes HandBrake&#8217;s encode queue to either come to the front if it has already been opened, or open it if not. A detailed explanation of both this window and Activity Window, the option below Show Queue in the Tools menu, will be provided below.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheButtonbar">The Button bar<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheButtonbar">#</a></span></h4>
<p>Below the Menu bar, the Button bar consists of HandBrake&#8217;s six main interface buttons: Source, Start, Add to Queue, Show Queue, Preview, and Activity Window.</p>

<p>The first button in line, Source, is used to select the source video for the conversion. HandBrake provides three different methods for choosing this file, selected from the dropdown menu revealed upon clicking the Source button. The first option, Video File, accepts a single video file as the source. The second, Folder, enables the selection of a DVD&#8217;s VIDEO_TS folder as the source, providing the capability to rip a DVD without encryption. Finally, <a href="https://trac.HandBrake.fr/wiki/SupportFAQ#titlespecificscan">Title Specific Scan</a> is used to rip an encrypted DVD. When a DVD is scanned using the Folder option, HandBrake is often unable to search the entire DVD for the main title due to the precautions taken to combat piracy; however, by using Title Specific Scan and manually inputting the main title&#8217;s number, HandBrake is occasionally able to successfully locate, scan, and add the feature film as the source video.</p>

<p>Next to Source, the Start button instantiates the conversion of either the videos in the queue or the video currently open in HandBrake. If there are videos in the queue as well as a video open in HandBrake&#8217;s main window, the videos in the queue will be encoded while the video open in HandBrake&#8217;s main window will be ignored. Once the conversion has begun, the Start button is replaced with a button labeled &#8220;Stop&#8221;. Clicking the Stop button will immediately halt the conversion and render the video currently being converted unplayable.</p>

<p>Batch video encodes are often handled in a very similar manner regardless of the application. First, videos are added to the queue. Most applications permit videos to be added one at a time or in batches of up to an entire directory. Once the queue has been populated, a conversion profile can be used to load a collection of settings such as resolution, codec, and frame rate. These are the settings each video in the queue will be converted with. Finally, the conversion is started. This process works exceptionally well if each video in the queue has similar properties. For example, when each video has an aspect ratio of 4:3 and a similar resolution. However, if the queue contains videos of different types, problems begin to arise when the same conversion profile, the same conversion parameters, are applied to each video. For example, converting a queue of 4:3 videos to a smaller resolution with the 4:3 aspect ratio would be perfectly acceptable, but this would not be the case if half the queue had a ratio of 16:9, as converting from a ratio of 16:9 to 4:3 is guaranteed to produce sub-optimal results. The concept of aspect ratios will be discussed in much greater detail later on in the article, so for now bear with me.</p>

<p>The process for setting up a batch encode in HandBrake is very similar to that of most other conversion applications, with one key difference: each video must be added to the queue individually; there is no &#8220;batch add&#8221; feature in HandBrake. First, a video is opened in the main window. From here the conversion parameters are set either manually or through the application of a preset, which is HandBrake&#8217;s equivalent to a conversion profile. Once the conversion parameters are set, the Add to Queue button will append the current video to the bottom of the queue. Since HandBrake does not allow for multiple videos to be opened simultaneously, this process must be repeated for each video added to the queue. To make this process a bit easier though, HandBrake automatically retains conversion parameters such as resolution, codecs, and frame rate within the current session and loads those settings for each new video automatically. Requiring that videos be added one by one eliminates the problems a one-size-fits-all approach such as the one described above creates by allowing for the conversion parameters to be changed depending on the source video; and by retaining conversion parameters between each new video, HandBrake makes the process of adding new videos to the queue quick and easy for videos with similar properties. In combination, these two features make HandBrake&#8217;s queue much more powerful than most others.</p>

<p>To open the queue, from which the order can be manipulated, items can be removed, and videos can be re-opened in HandBrake&#8217;s main window, click the Show Queue button. Once the Encode Queue window is open, right-clicking any of the listed entries will reveal a context menu containing options to move the selected video up, down, to remove it from the queue, or to edit the video. The Edit command removes the selected video from the queue and opens it in the main window while simultaneously loading its conversion parameters. From there, it is possible to modify the video&#8217;s conversion parameters before re-adding it to the queue, done by clicking Add to Queue once again. Note, however, that if a video is appended to the queue, edited, and re-appended to the queue, it will not be in the same place it was prior to being edited. To change an entry&#8217;s position, use the Move Up or Move Down command.</p>

<p>Encodes can also be started or paused from the Encode Queue window. Prior to the conversion starting, the Encode button will instantiate the conversion. Once the conversion has started though, HandBrake disables the Encode button and adds a new button to the interface, labeled &#8220;Pause&#8221;. Clicking Pause during an encode prevents HandBrake from passing any more queue items to the encode, but does not pause the current conversion. To stop the current job, click Stop in the main window, which replaces the Start button once the encode has begun. The Stop button will also stop any subsequent conversion from taking place, and render the video currently being converted unplayable.</p>

<p>Next to the Encode button, the Queue button causes a dropdown menu to appear containing four options: Generate Batch Script, Import Queue, and Export Queue. The first option, Generate Batch Script, creates a batch script containing the necessary commands to convert each item in the queue with the conversion parameters it was added with. Once saved, this script can be executed at any time by double-clicking the <em>.bat script on a Windows machine, or the </em>.sh script on UNIX-based machines. Depending on the operating system, a Command Prompt or Terminal window will appear and the encode will begin, all without the need to open HandBrake&#8217;s main interface. Additionally, batch scripts also allow for multiple encodes to take place at once. Be aware, though, that despite the ability to have multiple conversions running at the same time, the encoder will not work any faster. For example, suppose that a computer maxed out at an encoding speed of around 25 to 30 frames per second. Multiple encodes running at the same time simply divides that number evenly for each instance of a conversion. In other words, running three conversions simultaneously on a computer maxing out at 30 frames per second would result in each conversion processing approximately 10 frames per second.</p>

<p>Next in line is Import, but it makes more sense to skip ahead to Export, discuss that option first, and then come back to Import once that is finished. Export takes each item in the queue and generates an XML file with the conversion parameters for each entry&#160;&#8212;&#160;much like the Generate Batch Script tool does. Unlike the batch script though, this file requires that HandBrake be open for it to be of use: once the generated XML file has been saved, Import is used to populate the queue with the items referenced within the XML file. In practice it makes sense to use the Export and Import tools when the need to edit conversion parameters for some or all of the items in the queue may present itself at a later date. Besides editing the Query Editor, there is no way to modify conversion parameters in a generated batch script; however, once a queue is imported using the Import tool, each item can be edited using the Edit function.</p>

<p>Finally, the dropdown menu at the top of the Encode Queue window, labeled &#8220;When Done:&#8221;, allows for a specific action to be taken once the queue has finished converting. These options include Do Nothing, Shutdown, Suspend, Hibernate, Lock System, Log Off, and Quit HandBrake. Due to the fact that encodes in general and especially those using high-level settings take quite some time to complete, this feature often comes in handy.</p>

<p>Encode Queue&#8217;s second section, labeled &#8220;Current Job&#8221;, contains information pertaining the the current conversion&#8217;s progress such as the source and destination location, progress, time remaining, and the parameters the video is being converted with.</p>

<p>The third and final section of the Encode Queue window displays each queue entry. Additionally, this area also displays the status of the current job, the number of chapters in the video, the location of the source and destination files, and the video and audio encoder HandBrake will use during the conversion. Right-clicking any of the entries in this area will cause a dropdown menu to appear containing four of the options discussed above: Move Up, Move Down, Edit, and Delete.</p>

<p>Next to the Show Queue button, the Preview button opens the Video Preview window. From this window a preview of the current source video, with the conversion parameters specified in HandBrake&#8217;s main window, can be quickly rendered to test the appropriateness of the output. This tool is especially useful when converting a video with subtitles, for example, to check and see if the video is going to appear as desired before spending an hour on the encode. Within the Video Preview window there are two fields and a few buttons: the first field, labeled &#8220;Start at preview:&#8221;, is used to select a starting point for the preview. The numbers in the corresponding dropdown menu do not necessarily correspond to seconds or chapters in the source video, they are simply arbitrary beginnings points for the encode. Next, the field labeled &#8220;Duration:&#8221; defines how long, in seconds, the preview should last. At the bottom of the window, the &#8220;Use system default player&#8221; checkbox causes the preview video, once encoded, to play using your system default player; otherwise, HandBrake uses VLC. Clicking the Play button to the right of the checkbox will begin encoding the preview video regardless of whether or not a video is already being converted in HandBrake&#8217;s main window or from the queue. Once finished, the preview video will be saved to the default output directory, from which it can be dealt with in the same manner a normal video would be. As soon as the preview is rendered, it will begin playing.</p>

<p>Last in line, the Activity Window button either opens or brings the Activity Window to the front. The Activity Window is automatically populated by something called the Scan Log. Every time a video is opened in HandBrake, HandBrake scans it for information to fill the main window with. The queried information includes filename, path (location), duration, video codec, bitrate, frame rate, and practically every other detail one could ever wish to know about a video. Once HandBrake has obtained this information it not only populates the relevant fields in the main window with that information, but also writes that information to the Scan Log. HandBrake saves the most recent scan log to the <em>logs</em> directory, which can be located by right-clicking the scan log&#8217;s window and firing on &#8220;Open Individual Log File Directory&#8221;. As a side note, clicking the &#8220;Copy&#8221; option, or clicking the &#8220;Copy to clipboard&#8221; button at the top of the Activity Window, will copy the scan log to the clipboard. The most recent scan log is saved as &#8220;last_scan_log1.txt&#8221;.</p>

<p>Back in the Activity Window, the dropdown menu currently labeled &#8220;Scan Log&#8221; contains one other option, allowing for the selection of the Encode Log as the current view rather than the Scan log. Every time HandBrake converts a video, details of the conversion such as path, output directory, and conversion parameters&#160;&#8212;&#160;as well as some of the video&#8217;s properties&#160;&#8212;&#160;are saved to the encode log. During the conversion, the encode log also contains information as to the conversion&#8217;s progress. Selecting &#8220;Encode Log&#8221; displays the most recent encode log in the Activity Window. The most recent encode log is also saved to the <em>logs</em> folder, just as the Scan Log is, as &#8220;last_encode_log1.txt&#8221;. Additionally, previous encode logs are combined with the respective video&#8217;s scan log and saved as a single plaintext file in the <em>logs</em> directory. These logs are named after the video from which their information was derived.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheSourceSection">The Source Section<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheSourceSection">#</a></span></h4>
<p>Beneath the button bar, the Source section displays the source video&#8217;s name next to the label &#8220;Source:&#8221;. Additionally, this section also allows for the selection of the title to be used in the conversion, a starting point for the conversion, and an end point for the conversion. The start and end points can be set using chapters, seconds, or frames; be aware, however, that delimiting the conversion by chapters is the only method guaranteed to be consistent; choosing seconds or frames will not produce a consistent result. In my experience, both the Seconds and Frames options have yielded a variation of up to but rarely exceeding around three seconds from the desired end point. Selecting a title to convert is as simple as choosing an option from the dropdown menu labeled &#8220;Title:&#8221;. For most sources with the exception of DVDs, this menu will only contain one option, which HandBrake will automatically select after scanning the video. Next, the method for selecting the range of the conversion must be chosen. Once chosen, a start and end point can be selected from their respective dropdown menus. Leaving the start and end point fields at the defaults will convert the entire video. Finally, the length of the output video is displayed beside the last dropdown menu, next to the label &#8220;Duration:&#8221;.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheDestinationsection">The Destination section<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheDestinationsection">#</a></span></h4>
<p>The Destination Section provides the ability to temporarily change the output directory and file name for the current conversion. The output directory is changed by clicking the &#8220;Browse&#8221; button and selecting a new directory, and the file name is changed by modifying the value in the text field labeled &#8220;File:&#8221;. Alternately, the destination location and file name can also be temporarily changed by editing the contents of the text field manually.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TheOutputSettingsSection">The Output Settings Section<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheOutputSettingsSection">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Most videos can be thought of as consisting of multiple levels: the first level is the container format, which is the file seen and interacted with through the file browser. Some common container formats, for example, are MKV and MP4. Within that container file, which functions much like a folder in the sense that it can contain multiple files within itself, resides the video and audio track, as well as any subtitles and metadata such as chapters. Each of these elements are stored as separate sub-files. From this point the various components can be further divided and examined, but for now this article is only concerned with the first level, the container format, and the second level where the audio, video, and subtitles are stored, and how they are stored there. HandBrake has the ability to utilize two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_format_(digital">container formats</a>): either the MP4 container or the MKV container. Since container formats are simply wrappers for the data stored within them, neither format has any compression or quality advantage over the other. To choose either the MP4 or MKV container, select the desired format from the dropdown menu next to the label &#8220;Container:&#8221;.</p>

<p>Continuing on in the Output Settings section, there are three checkboxes labeled &#8220;Large file size&#8221;, &#8220;Web optimized&#8221;, and &#8220;iPod 5G Support&#8221;. These three checkboxes allow the conversion to be fine-tuned for one or more of the three scenarios outlined by their names; that is, by ensuring that an MP4 file breaching 4GB is not corrupted, optimizing the video for web-streaming, or forcing compatibility with fifth-generation iPod Nanos, respectively. Note that these options are only valid for the MP4 container though, and thus will be disabled if the MKV container format is selected.</p>

<p>With a source, range, destination, and container format defined, the remaining conversion parameters such as resolution, frame rate, and subtitles are set within HandBrake&#8217;s eight tabs: Picture, Video Filters, Video, Audio, Subtitles, Chapters, and Advanced. Each tab is discussed in detail in the order I listed them throughout the following paragraphs, beginning with Picture. However, here is a brief summary of each: the Picture tab controls the output resolution of the video, and defines any cropping applied to the video during the encode. Video Filters allows for the application of various filters to the output video with the intent to improve playback quality. Video, the third tab in line, provides for the selection of the video codec for the conversion, as well as the frame rate and bitrate. Audio, next in line, contains options for choosing the audio track for the encode. Subtitles controls the application of subtitles in the video. Second to last, the Chapters tab displays the chapters of the source video and allows for chapters to be turned off in the output video. Finally, Advanced is used to set various high-level parameters such as the maximum number of reference frames, for example, or the method used for motion estimation. Special attention will be afforded to this tab later on in the article.</p>

<p>The Picture tab consists of two sections: Size and Cropping. To the left, the Size section contains fields and options for customizing the output resolution. On the right, Cropping controls any cropping applied during the encode. By default, HandBrake automatically sets cropping depending on the resolution set in Size; however, selecting &#8220;Custom&#8221; rather than &#8220;Automatic&#8221;, the default option, enables cropping to be applied manually. To select an output resolution, first expand the Anamorphic dropdown menu. This menu contains four options: &#8220;None&#8221;, &#8220;Strict&#8221;, &#8220;Loose&#8221;, and &#8220;Custom&#8221;. &#8220;None&#8221; allows for both the height and width of the output video to be manually set, thus providing a higher degree of control than &#8220;Strict&#8221;, which prevents any change in resolution. &#8220;Custom&#8221; offers the most control of all four options, with &#8220;Loose&#8221; coming in as a compromise between the four. &#8220;Loose&#8221; automatically retains the source aspect ratio, a key attribute of a video and a crucial property to retain in order to produce the highest quality result possible, while also allowing for the resolution to be manually set through the modification of the field labeled &#8220;Width:&#8221;; once this value has been set, HandBrake automatically adjusts the height for the conversion to match the source aspect ratio. At the bottom of this section, the output display size is presented next to the label &#8220;Display Size:&#8221;.</p>

<p>Next, the Video Filters tab allows for the application of certain filters to a video during the encoding process. Available filters are as follows: Detelecine, Decomb, Deinterlace, Denoise, Deblock, and Grayscale Encoding.</p>

<ul>
<li>Telecining is the process of transferring cinema video, which generally has a frame rate of 24FPS, to match the requirements of a TV, which is usually 25 or 30FPS. To accomplish this transition, some frames are duplicated. <a href="http://home4film.com/questions/1042/what-is-telecine-what-does-detelecine-do-when-ripping">The Detelecine feature</a> in HandBrake scans the source video for duplicate frames, regardless of whether they were added through the telecining process or not, and removes any that are found. This process results in a smaller file size and sometimes even a sharper picture, though can occasionally cause the video to jump during playback due to the fact that some frames are being removed; however, this occurrence is uncommon with modern detelecining techniques.</li>
<li><a href="http://neuron2.net/LVG/interlacing.html">Interlacing</a> occurs when interlaced video, which is video split into two fields to be viewed on a TV, is played on a progressive scan display such as a computer monitor. In this situation, interlacing artifacts, sometimes referred to as <em>combing artifacts</em>, become visible. Because TV displays are <em>interlaced displays</em>, these combing artifacts are often invisible to the human eye when played on an interlaced display, though, as mentioned earlier, they become visible on a progressive scan display. To handle interlacing, HandBrake has two different tools for the job: <a href="https://trac.HandBrake.fr/wiki/Decomb">Deinterlace and Decomb</a>.</li>
<li>Deinterlacing is the process of converting interlaced video, which is common amongst analog television and HDTV signals, into a non-interlaced format. However, although deinterlacing accomplishes its task, the process also reduces picture quality and adds a substantial amount of time to the conversion process.</li>
<li>Decombing, on the other hand, works by looking at each pixel of each frame of video, and then only deinterlacing frames that show visible amounts of distortion. By being &#8220;smarter&#8221; about how it scans for interlaced video, the decombing method is a better option to use when deinterlacing video than the actual deinterlace feature.</li>
<li>The denoise filter removes excess noise from the video, which can sometimes help improve the overall quality of the video, or, according to the HandBrake wiki, lower the bitrate.</li>
<li>To help smooth out low-quality videos, HandBrake provides the deblocking filter. This filter&#8217;s purpose is to decrease the number of outstanding blocks visible in the video, often referred to as &#8220;pixelation&#8221;. Dragging the slider to the right causes the encoder to more aggressively scan and remove blocks. There is a similar tool in the Advanced tab, discussed later on, that provides much more control than this filter.</li>
<li>Finally, the Grayscale checkbox removes color from the video. If your source video is black and white to begin with, turn this filter on to prevent any addition of subtle colors during the conversion process.</li>
</ul>


<p>The next tab in line, Video, has two sections: Video and Quality. The Video section is used to select the video codec and frame rate to be used in the output video, while the Quality section contains fields for setting the bitrate.</p>

<p>Earlier I explained that audio and video tracks are stored within container files, though I did not explain <em>how</em> they are stored, simply that they <em>are</em> stored there. To store this media, encoders utilize something called a <em>codec</em>. The word &#8220;codec&#8221; comes from a combination of the two words &#8220;encoder&#8221; and &#8220;decoder&#8221;, and thus is a set of rules defining the manner in which the form of media should be stored (encoded) within the container format, and the manner in which the media should be read (decoded) by the player.</p>

<p>The Video Codec dropdown menu allows you to choose between HandBrake&#8217;s four available video codecs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2">MPEG-2</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4">MPEG-4</a> for the MP4 container, and an additional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP3">VP3</a> codec for the MKV container. Each of these codecs are inherently lossy, which means that they apply some form of compression to the data stream while also removing data deemed to be &#8220;extraneous&#8221; during the encoding process, all in order to achieve a smaller file size. The combination of compression and data removal results in the loss of some quality, though the decrease in quality depends on a number of factors. Lossless codecs, on the other hand, do apply some compression, but unlike lossy codecs retain <em>all</em> the data in a stream. Lossless codecs therefore produce larger files, but due to the fact that they retain all the information from the source they are the preferred method for storing media in a manner through which to preserve as much quality as possible. It is important to note, however, that just because a codec is defined as &#8220;lossy&#8221; does not necessarily mean that a video, or any other form of media, stored using that codec will necessarily be of a lower quality than that same file utilizing a losslesss codec: it all comes down to video codec and the settings used to convert the video.</p>

<p>In this case, of the four available codecs, H.264 is by far the best option: supported by both container formats, the H.264 codec is not only more versatile, but also possesses numerous advantages over the MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and VP3 codecs. For example, videos encoded with the H.264 codec are able to achieve higher levels of quality at smaller file sizes than videos utilizing almost any other codec currently available, especially compared to HandBrake&#8217;s two alternatives. Additionally, rather than requiring the operating system to decode videos utilizing the H.264 codec, many mobile devices possess built-in hardware chips dedicated to decoding H.264 videos, resulting in lower power consumption during H.264 playback than with other codecs. There are other advantages to using the H.264 codec, such as more accurate motion estimation and interframe prediction, but the two reasons above&#160;&#8212;&#160;high-quality videos at smaller file sizes and decreased power consumption during playback&#160;&#8212;&#160;are arguably the most widely applicable.</p>

<p>Beneath the Video Codec dropdown menu, the frame rate menu contains options for manually selecting a frame rate for the output video, or using &#8220;Same as source&#8221;. As you may have guessed, &#8220;Same as source&#8221; uses the original video&#8217;s frame rate in the conversion.</p>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned that the detelecine feature has historically caused jumpy playback due to erroneously deeming certain frames as duplicates and removing them. Since videos are simply a collection of similar still images&#160;&#8212;&#160;frames&#160;&#8212;&#160;cycled through your field of vision fast enough to create the illusion of continuity and movement, the detelecine feature was able to cause this effect by disrupting that continuity of movement. A similar effect can be achieved by lowering a video&#8217;s frame rate: by lowering a video&#8217;s frame rate, data is removed that needs to be there in order to create the fluid movement expected of a video. Similarly, raising a video&#8217;s frame rate past the original value simply causes data to be duplicated in order to achieve the new frame rate, thus resulting in a larger file size without any increase in picture or playback quality.</p>

<p>Below the Framerate dropdown menu, the &#8220;Constant Framerate&#8221; checkbox forces the encoder to use the specified framerate throughout the entire video; &#8220;Variable Framerate&#8221;, on the other hand, allows the encoder to use lower framerates in scenes where little movement takes place, thereby greatly reducing the output file&#8217;s size.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate">bitrate</a> is another important factor in the overall quality of your video conversion, and is set within the Quality section of the Video tab. This parameter can be set in one of two ways: by setting the Avg Bitrate (kbps) field, which forces HandBrake to use the given bitrate in the conversion, or through the Constant Quality slider, HandBrake&#8217;s default and the recommended method for setting the bitrate.</p>

<p>The Constant Quality slider is automatically set depending on the selected video codec, though it is not required that the default value be used in the conversion. For example, when using the MPEG-4 codec, a QP (quantization parameter) value of 15 is set by default, whereas when using the H.264 codec, an RF (rate factor) value of 20 is used as the default. The QP and RF values are collectively referred to as the Constant Rate Factor, or CRF. I will discuss QP vs RF values in a bit, so for now bear with me.</p>

<p>Though it is possible to modify the default CRF value set by HandBrake, for most applications it is recommended that the default set by HandBrake be used. By moving the Constant Quality slider to the left or to the right, the amount of compression HandBrake will apply during the encoding process is adjusted. A higher CRF value will cause more compression to be applied to the video, while a lower value results in less compression and a higher-quality result, albeit in a larger file size. In fact, a CRF value of zero will apply absolutely no compression at all: it will convert the video in a completely lossless format. However, though this may sound like the ideal setting, the result is simply a massive video file that posses no greater level of quality than it would if it was converted with, for example, an RF value of 20. Note that the value of 20 was arbitrarily chosen to illustrate my point and is not necessarily the value you should select for each conversion. HandBrake&#8217;s wiki page on <a href="https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/ConstantQuality">Constant Quality</a> provides some example CRF values for common usage cases: for standard definition videos such as DVDs, it is recommended that an RF value of around 20 be applied. For high definition videos, however, such as Blu-rays, 720p, or 1080p videos, an RF value of approximately 22 is recommended.</p>

<p>Maintaining a constant quantization parameter (QP) value means compressing each frame by the same amount, whereas maintaining a constant rate factor (RF) value tells the encoder to compress different frames by different amounts according to detected motion. This functionality very closely mirrors the variable framerate option discussed earlier, which uses detected motion to determine whether or not the framerate can be safely reduced in any given part of the video without negatively effecting the quality of the result. Put more simply, setting a quantization parameter applies the same level of compression to the entire video regardless of movement or other factors, whereas setting a rate factor tells HandBrake to adjust the compression based on movement in the frame, with more compression being applied to scenes with a greater amount of movement since those scenes require less fine detail, and less compression being applied to scenes with little to no movement. Though it might seem, at first, that using a QP value would be more advantageous than using an RF value&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially for achieving a small output file size&#160;&#8212;&#160;it is, in fact, the opposite: setting an RF value is the preferred method for choosing a bitrate because it not only produces a smaller file, but also produces videos of a higher quality than those converted using a QP value because it applies less compression to frames that are more likely to be scrutinized, and more to frames that are less likely to be closely inspected. This is yet another reason why the H.264 codec, which uses RF compression, produces a higher-quality result at a better size than the MPEG-4 codec, which uses QP compression.</p>

<p>Earlier in my discussion of video codecs, I explained that both audio and video are stored within container formats as separate objects using something called a <em>codec</em>. As you know, HandBrake provides for the utilization of a few different video codecs; similarly, HandBrake offers four different audio codecs for the MP4 container, AAC, MP3, AC3, and DTS, as well as two additional formats for the MKV container: <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/faq/">Vorbis</a> and <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a>. For each of these codecs with the exception of Vorbis and FLAC, HandBrake offers multiple choices for audio encoders, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME">LAME</a> encoder for the MP3 codec or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAAC">faac</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg">ffmpeg</a> encoders for the AAC codec. Each codec also has another option which, for simplicity&#8217;s sake, can be considered an encoder of sorts: passthrough. The passthrough &#8220;encoder&#8221; simply passes the source audio to the new format without using a separate audio encoder. Thus, whereas each of the available audio codecs with the exception of FLAC are inherently lossy&#160;&#8212;&#160;FLAC stands for &#8220;Free Lossless Audio Codec&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;their &#8220;passthrough&#8221; counterparts are, on the other hand, lossless as in the case of the DTS codecs, or virtually lossless as in the case of the other audio formats. In order to retain the highest audio quality possible, it is recommended that one of these lossless formats be used. If you would prefer to use an audio codec with a higher compression ratio though, the AAC audio codec is the next best option as it provides higher quality audio than the MP3 codec at similar bitrates.</p>

<p>Before selecting an audio codec though, a source audio track must be selected. Like choosing a title to encode in the Source section, HandBrake rarely presents more than one audio track; however, when there is, it is extremely important that the correct track is selected. To select the source audio track, simply choose the appropriate option from the first dropdown menu in the Audio tab. If there is more than one option, each entry will generally be labeled with a language. For example, the first entry might read &#8220;1 English&#8221;, with the second entry labeled &#8220;2 Japanese&#8221;. Following the track&#8217;s name, HandBrake includes the codec it is stored with as well as the number of audio channels. Once an audio track has been selected, choosing an audio codec is as simple as selecting the desired option from the Audio Codec dropdown menu. When choosing an audio codec, keep in mind that while choosing a lossless audio codec such as FLAC or encoding the audio in a lossless manner using one of the passthrough &#8220;encoders&#8221; is theoretically a better idea than using a lossless format, the difference in audio quality will almost never be noticeable, and will only result in larger output files. Next to the Audio Codec dropdown menu, HandBrake provides six mixers for the audio track: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural">Mono</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound">Stereo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Surround">Dolby Surround</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Pro_Logic#Dolby_Pro_Logic_IIx">Dolby Pro Logic II</a>, and 6-channel Discrete.</p>

<p>Unlike Stereo, the mono mixer is designed to handle single-track audio streams and therefore centers the perspective in the sound field, whereas the stereo mixer uses two or more independent audio channels to produce the illusion of direction and perspective during audio playback. Although mono has largely been replaced by the stereo mixer, some fields continue to use it to this day. Continuing this trend of increasing audio channels, Dolby Surround, HandBrake&#8217;s next option for audio mixers, combines three independent audio streams to create an increasingly realistic soundscape. Dolby Pro Logic II takes a stereo track&#160;&#8212;&#160;recall that the stereo mixer uses two audio channels&#160;&#8212;&#160;and processes those two channels into five full-frequency audio streams in order to provide high-quality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound">surround sound</a>. 6-channel Discrete, on the other hand, stores six separate audio channels for use in playback.</p>

<p>Before I finish this section on mixers with my personal recommendations on the topic, let me talk a little bit more about Dolby Pro Logic II and how it works. As I said in the previous paragraph, the Dolby Pro Logic II mixer accepts a two-channel stereo track and, depending on the quality of the source, processes those two channels into five separate streams for surround sound playback. These five streams create the immerse surround sound experience by playing a track through each of the right front, center, left front, right rear, and left rear fields. As an aside, the 6-channel Discrete mixer relegates an audio track to each of these five fields as well as the missing area, center rear, <em>when the audio track provides for this type of playback</em>. The aspect that makes the Dolby Pro Logic II mixer especially interesting is that while other surround sound mixers require that the source already be formatted for surround sound, DPL II processes the much more common stereo audio track into the necessary five channels by extracting the difference between the spatial audio content of the two individual stereo channels. This feature provides for the application of surround sound in an audio stream not previously equipped with such an ability, an impossibility with the other surround sound mixers offered by HandBrake. Fortunately, HandBrake makes the mixer decision an easy one by displaying the number of channels contained within the source audio alongside the name of the track. In the unlikely case that the source audio is single-channel, using anything other than the mono mixer is pointless. In the event that the source audio consists of two tracks, on the other hand, both the stereo mixer or the DPL II mixer are suitable choices depending on whether the need for surround sound presents itself. For 5.1 channel audio tracks, HandBrake automatically chooses Dolby Pro Logic II as the mixer; I recommend leaving this choice as-is.</p>

<p>The sample rate is defined as the number of samples taken from a stream per unit of time. In its most basic form, the sample rate can be thought of as similar to the frame rate: the frame rate is the number of frames you see per second, while the sample rate, in the case of audio encoding, is the number of &#8220;frames&#8221; you <em>hear</em> each second. Just like when setting the frame rate, using a value as close to the source&#8217;s is the best way to produce a crisp and clear result, therefore making &#8220;Auto&#8221; my recommended setting for this field. Next to the Samplerate field, the Bitrate menu allows you to select a bitrate for the audio track. It is important to note that regardless of the conversion settings you use, the audio in your output video will never be of a higher quality than the source. If the source audio has a bitrate of 128kb/s, using 256kb/s in your conversion will just result in a larger file size, not an increase in quality. Therefore, the best way to set the audio bitrate is to take a look at the audio bitrate for the source video and use a bitrate close to the original&#8217;s as the conversion parameter. To check the source file&#8217;s bitrate, open the Scan log and browse through it until you find the audio bitrate, which should be around line 36. You can also use Ctrl+F to search the file for the label &#8220;Audio:&#8221;; the audio codec, sample rate, mixer, and bitrate for the source file will all be located on the same line in the order I just listed them.</p>

<p>Next to the Bitrate field, the DRC&#160;&#8212;&#160;or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">Dynamic Range Compression</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;parameter and the audio <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain">gain</a> are both set in the Advanced Audio window, opened by clicking the Advanced button towards the right edge of the section. When recording with a microphone, for example, <a href="http://www.marshallforum.com/workbench/190-what-gain-some-asked-me-so-here-we-go.html">increasing the gain magnifies the amplitude</a>, or signal strength, of the sound currently being processed by the microphone, thereby causing the microphone to become more sensitive to sound and thus making the recording louder; conversely, lowering the gain lessens the signal strength and thus causes the microphone to become less sensitive, making the recording quieter. With this talk of increasing and decreasing the volume of a recording through the modification of gain, it is easy to become confused as to the actual role of gain control in audio processing: the gain should <em>not</em> be used to make a recording louder or softer; that is the job of the volume. Instead, gain should be used to increase the sensitivity of the microphone, thus providing for clearer recording if set correctly. That said, HandBrake implements gain in a manner not exactly synonymous with the widely accepted usage of gain: in HandBrake, gain <em>is</em> actually used to increase or decrease the volume of an audio track. When using the gain to accomplish this task in HandBrake, setting the gain at anything more than +10 is guaranteed to cause the audio track to become distorted during loud parts and virtually inaudible during very quiet scenes.</p>

<p>Below the Audio Gain setting, the Dynamic Range slider makes it possible to manually set the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range">dynamic range</a> of an audio track. The dynamic range is the ratio between the largest and smallest possible values in the audio track. Setting this value manually both increases the volume of quiet sounds and decreases the volume of loud sounds, bringing the waveform closer together. HandBrake&#8217;s wiki page on the subject, <a href="https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/DynRangeCompression">Dynamic Range Compression</a>, provides examples for suitable values: the default value of 0 prevents HandBrake from applying any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">dynamic range compression</a> to the audio stream; a value of 1.0 uses compression hints embedded within the audio track; a value greater than 1.0 normalizes the audio stream as described above.</p>

<p>Next in line, the Subtitles tab has three buttons at the top: Add, Remove, and Import SRT. Add and Remove are self-explanatory: they add or remove a subtitle track from a video, respectively. Import SRT, on the other hand, requires a bit of explaining. Before I go into the details though, take a look at an extract from a sample SRT file:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1</p>
<p>00:00:01,000 &#160;&#8212;&#160;&gt; 00:00:05,000</p>
<p>This is the first subtitle</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>00:00:06,000 &#160;&#8212;&#160;&gt; 00:00:10,000</p>
<p>This is the second subtitle</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>00:00:011,000 &#160;&#8212;&#160;&gt; 00:00:15,000</p>
<p>And this is the third subtitle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This snippet of text, which would be saved as a *.SRT file, tells the video player to present &#8220;This is the first subtitle&#8221; from the first second through the fifth second. After the first subtitle, &#8220;This is the second subtitle&#8221; would be presented for four seconds, after which &#8220;And this is the third subtitle&#8221; would be displayed from the 11th through the 15th second. The numbers&#160;&#8212;&#160;in this case 1, 2, and 3&#160;&#8212;&#160;preceding the timestamp define the subtitle&#8217;s number, which allows the player to present the subtitles in the correct order. Beneath the subtitle&#8217;s number, the timing is in the format of HH:MM:SS,MS. First, a starting point for the subtitle (the contents of which are defined on the next line) is chosen, followed by &#8220;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&gt;&#8221;, then an end point. As I said in the last sentence, the third line in the set is the contents of the subtitle for the given amount of time. This is what makes up an SRT file: a very, very long collection of similar entries to the one above. For most videos, the SRT file is bundled into the container format, though on DVDs, for example, you can often find single SRT files for alternate languages somewhere in the file tree. The Import SRT option allows you to take a standalone SRT file and bundle it together with your output video during the encoding process, thus resulting in that single container format with yet another separate file inside it.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you are importing an SRT file or not, you need to select the subtitle to add from the &#8220;Track&#8221; dropdown menu, which is the first menu in the Subtitle tab. Generally, the subtitles listed in this menu will be named something like &#8220;English UTF&#8221; or &#8220;English SSA&#8221;. SSA and UTF are the two most common character encodings I have seen subtitles in, though there are many other character encodings available. If you do not see &#8220;English <em>character encoding</em>&#8221;, there should be an option labeled &#8220;Foreign Audio Search (Bitmap)&#8221;. If HandBrake cannot identify the subtitle track in the source, this option will attempt to extract bitmap images of the subtitle track from the source file to be used in the output video. If no subtitle track can be found, the Foreign Audio Search (Bitmap) option will still be displayed in the &#8220;Track&#8221; menu, though selecting it will not cause any subtitles to be added to the output video since they do not exist.</p>

<p>With a subtitle track selected, you have to decide how it will be displayed on your video. To do this, HandBrake provides three checkboxes that decide which and in what manner those subtitles will be presented to you during playback. In order of appearance, the checkboxes are as follows: Forced Only, Burned In, and Default. First, Forced Only tells HandBrake to display subtitles only when they are &#8220;forced&#8221; in the source video. For example, if you were watching a film mostly in your native language with a few parts in another language, the movie would most likely have subtitles at the parts during which a foreign language was spoken. These are called forced subtitles, and are present whether or not you turn on subtitles for the rest of the movie. Second in line, the Burned In option overlays the subtitle track on the video. At first glance this might seem like a bad idea, but consider the manner in which subtitles are displayed otherwise: if a subtitle track is not burned in to the video, the text will display in a small, opaque bar at the bottom of the screen. The subtitles will display one after another in this manner according to the length they are prescribed to display for&#160;&#8212;&#160;just as they should. However, due to the size of the display bar on some devices, only one line can be displayed at a time. For the most part this is fine, but as soon as multiple subtitles need to be displayed at once&#160;&#8212;&#160;think numerous people speaking at once, for example, or a crowd shouting&#160;&#8212;&#160;you begin running into problems. As soon as more than one line of text needs to be displayed at the same time, the video player will split that text into separate lines and display them individually, which results in either the last subtitle overwriting all previous entries in the set, or each subtitle being displayed for <em>x</em> seconds. But since as far as the video is concerned each of those multiple subtitle lines were displayed at once, the subtitle timing can become offset for the rest of the video. Therefore, Burned In is the best option to use if you know you will have multiple lines of subtitles at any point in the video. You cannot, however, turn off subtitles if they are burned in to the video, so think carefully before you choose this option. Finally, Default causes the subtitle track to appear automatically rather than requiring the viewer to manually turn it on after the video starts playing. If you are using the Burned In option you do not need to check Default.</p>

<p>Next to the three checkboxes explained in the previous paragraph, there are three more fields: Srt Language, Srt Char Code, and Srt Offset (ms). These three fields are only applicable if you import an SRT file, in which case they allow you to select the SRT file&#8217;s language, character encoding, and provide an offset in case the timing is somewhat off, respectively.</p>

<p>As soon as you&#8217;ve finished customizing your subtitles&#8217; settings, clicking the Add button will add that subtitle track to the video during the conversion. A list of subtitle tracks that will be added during the conversion can be found near the bottom of the Subtitles menu. This area not only displays the track&#8217;s name, but also whether or not the specific subtitles track was added with the Forced Only, Burned In, or Default options. To remove a subtitle track from a video, highlight it and click Remove.</p>

<p>Continuing on down the line, the Chapters tab allows you to view, edit, import, and export video chapters, as well as turn them off in the output video. Video chapters are simply logical splits in the video that divide it into sections which can be skipped to during playback. An example of good chapter usage would be a chapter for a show&#8217;s introduction, a chapter for the main title, and a chapter for the ending, which could include title credits or a preview of the next show, for example. Various other chapters could be added, but that would be a good example of logical splits in a video using chapters.</p>

<p>If you want to turn chapters off for some reason, simply de-select the checkbox labeled &#8220;Create chapter markers&#8221; near the top of the tab. If this checkbox is grayed-out, your source video does not have any chapters. Beneath the checkbox, the current chapters are displayed in two columns: Chapter Number and Chapter Name, which contain the chapters&#8217; number and name, respectively. If you would like to view the start and end time of a chapter, open up the Scan log and look for a line resembling this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Metadata:</p>
<p>title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Prologue</p>
<p>Chapter #0.1: start 182.089000, end 271.979000</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be an entry similar to this one for each chapter in the video. Each entry contains the following information: the chapter&#8217;s title, number, and start and end time, in seconds. From this information you can fairly easily discern a chapter&#8217;s place in the video, and change the chapter&#8217;s name in HandBrake&#8217;s main window if you wish. To change a chapter&#8217;s name, simple double-click the entry in the Chapter Name column, then type in the desired chapter name.</p>

<p>The last tab in line, Advanced, handles the nitty-gritty details of motion estimation, inter frame prediction, video compression, and many more advanced conversion parameters for the H.264 video. The settings within this tab are automatically set and locked from changes for both the MPEG-4 and VP3 codecs. For customizing the conversion parameters, the settings in this tab are divided into three sections: Encoding, Psychovisual, and Analysis. The Encoding section deals with video compression; Psychovisual toggles the x264 encoder&#8217;s DCT-Decimation feature, which prevents the encoder from removing data blocks deemed to contain little or no information; and Analysis manages the encoder&#8217;s settings for analyzing the source video.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Encoding">Encoding<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Encoding">#</a></span></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.axis.com/products/video/about_networkvideo/compression.htm">Interframe prediction</a> is a process that involves storing a fully independent reference frame, called an I-frame, and comparing it to a variable number of subsequent frames. If any similarities are found between the I-frame and those subsequent frames, the duplicate data will not be stored in the subsequent frames and will instead be referenced from the I-frame. Frames that reference data are one of two types: P- or B-frames. P-frames can make references to parts of earlier I- or P-frames instead of storing that information, and on average contain around 50% of the data an I-frame does. B-frames, on the other hand, make references to preceding <em>and</em> succeeding I- or P-frames, and can contain as little as 25% of the data an I-frame stores. Here are a few examples to aid in the comprehension of this concept:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;I</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an example of how videos that do not use interframe prediction store information: each frame as an entirely independent image with no references made to previous (or succeeding) frames regardless of whether or not any duplicate information is present between them. Now if that video were to be converted and the use of P-frames was enabled, it would look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&nbsp;P</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frame #1 is the I-frame, as the set must start with a full image containing all the information; frames #2, #3, and #4 are all P-frames that reference either the I-frame or one of the preceding P-frames, and only include the information that has changed between its frame and the preceding frame. So, for example, if these four frames were part of a longer video of a person walking to a house, the I-frame would contain everything: the person, the house, and the surroundings. The P-frames, then, would reference the house and the surroundings from the I-frame, as those would remain consistent from frame to frame, and would only include the person&#8217;s movement between each frame.</p>

<p>Now think back to my description of P-frames: when I was explaining P-frames, I described them to contain as little as 50% of the data in an I-frame. Even in a four-frame example such as this, the decrease in size is significant. If P- <em>and</em> B-frames are used though, the size decrease becomes even more significant. The resulting video, when played, would look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;P</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this video, the first frame is an I-frame. Then, instead of three P-frames, two B-frames are substituted for the middle P-frames. The video ends with a P-frame due to the B-frames&#8217; requirement of having something to reference both preceding them as well as succeeding them. However, due to the nature of B-frames, the video is actually encoded with this frame order:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;B</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The frames are stored within the video in this order because B-frames must have a frame to reference both preceding them <em>and</em> succeeding them, so the encoder must first encode the I-frame, then encode a P-frame in order to give those B-frames something to reference in front of and behind them. Once the I- and P-frames have been encoded, the two B-frames are encoded and inserted between those two frames, resulting in what you end up watching: I B B P. Otherwise, if the frames were encoded in the same order as they are perceived, the B-frames would have no succeeding frames to reference, and would therefore be incomplete. But the encoder does not encode the first frame (the I-frame), encode the second frame (the P-frame), and then insert two additional frames between them&#160;&#8212;&#160;that would only result in <em>larger</em> files, not smaller ones. Instead, this is the process the encoder uses:</p>

<ol>
<li>Encode the first frame in the set. This is the fully-independent I-frame. The video now looks like this: &#8220;I&#8221;</li>
<li>Jump ahead and encode the fourth frame in the video, totally disregarding frames #2 and #3. Note that it is only the fourth frame in this example and could vary depending on the conversion settings. Now, the video looks like this: &#8220;I&nbsp;&nbsp;P&#8221; Where &#8220;I&#8221; is the first frame, and &#8220;P&#8221; is actually the <em>fourth</em> frame in the video, not the second; it is only placed in the second&#8217;s place for the time being. You can think of the frames in the example above as in this order to make the concept clearer: I _ _ P.</li>
<li>Next, the I- and P-frames are compared: any differences found between them&#160;&#8212;&#160;and there will be quite a few since the first frame is frame #1 and the second frame is actually #4&#160;&#8212;&#160;are made into B-frames. The number of B-frames used is a parameter for the conversion, and therefore will vary. The finished video looks like this: &#8220;I&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;&nbsp;P&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, we wind up with a video that, instead of containing four full-image frames, has a single full-image frame followed by three reference frames. By discarding frames #2 and #3 in this example and substituting them with B-frames containing up to 25% of the data the original frames would have, the output video will be much smaller than the original. The use of this sort of compression makes eliminating a great deal of data that does not necessarily need to be there possible, with little cost to the overall quality of the video. However, due to the fact that, in this case, two frames are completely discarded and their contents interpolated from the surrounding frames, there is some decrease in quality.</p>

<p>The Reference Frame setting in the Advanced tab controls the number of reference frames that can be used by the encoder. HandBrake&#8217;s default is one, which means that the video encoder will use one P-frame in the conversion, preceded by a variable number of B-frames set in the next field. Currently, the H.264 video codec supports a maximum of 16 reference frames, which means that a maximum combination of 16 P-frames could be used in a video utilizing this codec before a new I-frame would need to be used. The general consensus, though, is to use no more than four reference frames to avoid losing too much quality. HandBrake recommends between 1 and 6 for optimal quality.</p>

<p>Next in line, the Maximum B-Frames setting controls the number of sequential B-frames that can be implemented before a new I- or P-frame must be inserted. The H.264 codec currently supports a maximum of sixteen B-Frames before a new I- or P-frame must be used, though the recommended number is much less: HandBrake recommends between two and five sequential B-frames, though it is generally accepted that no more than three B-frames should be used sequentially in order to achieve the ideal trade-off between quality and file size.</p>

<p>Earlier, when I discussed lossy and lossless codecs, I explained that both types of codecs do compress data; the key difference between lossy and lossless codecs is that lossy codecs discard data deemed to be extraneous. A common example of data that might be discarded by a lossy codec would be sound regarded to be beyond the range of human hearing. Regardless of the type of codec though, lossy or lossless, the data stream is compressed in order to save space. In HandBrake, there are two available compression schemas: CABAC and CABLC. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-adaptive_binary_arithmetic_coding">CABAC</a>, short for Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding, is known to require less processing power to decode than the CAVLC coder, though compresses data less effectively. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-adaptive_variable-length_coding">CAVLC</a>, short for Context-Adaptive Variable-Length Coding, on the other hand, compresses data streams with better results, though at the cost of decoding speed. To turn on CABAC coding, select the checkbox next to the label &#8220;CABAC Entropy Coding&#8221;; un-checking this field will cause HandBrake to utilize the CAVLC coder.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_estimation">Motion estimation</a> is the process of defining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_vector">motion vectors</a> that describe the transformation of blocks from one frame to another. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_compensation">Motion <em>compensation</em></a> is the result of this process: by calculating the change between the blocks of two or more adjacent frames the encoder can determine which blocks, if any, are duplicates of the original frame&#8217;s whose places were simply shifted. If any duplicates are found that match this criteria, they will be referenced from the original I-frame or a preceding P-frame. In a nutshell, that&#8217;s how inter frame prediction works. This process relies entirely on something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroblock">macroblocks</a>, which are composed of two or more blocks of pixels. The actual block size varies depending on the video, but here are a few of the more common block sizes (in pixels): 16x16, 8x8, and 4x4. The smaller the block size, the more likely a match will be found between the original frame and subsequent frames, which in turn results in a smaller video since a larger amount of data can be referenced rather than stored. The 8x8 Transform checkbox allows HandBrake to use 8x8 blocks rather than, for example, 16x16 blocks. By using smaller block sizes the encoder can more accurately estimate motion and utilize inter frame prediction, which in turn produces smaller files.</p>

<p>Enabling <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=674819#post674819">weighted P-frames</a>, done by checking the Weighted P-frames checkbox, allows the encoder to assign &#8220;weights&#8221; to reference frames. This feature is especially helpful during fades where one frame is simply darker or lighter than the preceding frame. In most cases the encoder is unable to recognize the similarity between frames in this situation for the simple reason that the entire image is changing. However, by enabling weighted prediction the encoder is more likely to recognize the similarity between frames in a fade-like situation, which means more reference frames. And as you know by now, more reference frames means a smaller file size. Note, though, that not all devices support this feature, so you may want to use the Preview tool to generate a short preview in order to test for compatibility.</p>

<p>Remember back when I was describing B-frames and said that they could not reference other B-frames, just preceding or succeeding I- or P-frames? That is not entirely true: so long as you allow more than one consecutive B-frame, setting the Pyramidal B-frames dropdown menu to &#8220;Normal&#8221; or &#8220;Strict&#8221; will enable B-frames to reference other B-frames. By default HandBrake allows this, though you can disable this feature by selecting &#8220;Off&#8221;; however, as it will decrease the video&#8217;s size with little to no loss in quality, if any, I recommend keeping this feature enabled.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Psychovisual">Psychovisual<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Psychovisual">#</a></span></h4>
<p>During the conversion the encoder considers each data block before writing it to the output video. By default, blocks that are deemed to contain little or no data are simply discarded&#160;&#8212;&#160;decimated, one might say. However, by checking the No DCT-Decimate checkbox you can disable this feature, thus allowing even data blocks that contain little or no information to be written to the output video. The encoder is generally pretty good at determining whether a block contains useful data though, so leaving this option at its default, enabled, is recommended, as disabling DCT-decimation will not increase your video&#8217;s quality by a noticeable amount and in most cases simply offers a larger file size.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Analysis">Analysis<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Analysis">#</a></span></h4>
<p>When determining whether to use a B-frame or not, the x264 encoder has a variety of algorithms at its disposal. The Fast mode, HandBrake&#8217;s default, takes the same amount of time regardless of the number of B-frames. However, due to its speed the results are often sub-optimal. If you want the best results, the highest quality video at a small size, choosing Optimal is the recommended course of action. By using the Optimal mode the encoder will take longer to convert the video, but the resulting video will be both smaller and of a higher quality. Additionally, Optimal is recommended if the use of pyramidal B-frames is enabled, as B-frames referencing other B-frames can quickly lead to poor quality if not handled correctly.</p>

<p>The Adaptive Direct Mode setting has four options for choosing the manner in which the encoder predicts motion in B-frames: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_frame#Enhanced_Direct.2FSkip_Macroblock">Spatial</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_frame#Enhanced_Direct.2FSkip_Macroblock">Temporal</a>, None, and Automatic. Spatial mode uses the motion vectors from neighboring blocks rather than calculating a new motion vector for each block, thus cutting down on the number of calculations required and speeding up the overall conversion process. The Temporal option compares the current block to the matched block in a succeeding P-frame and uses this measure to estimate the motion rather than calculating it again for each block. None, as you might guess, does not use any prediction, thus causing a motion vector to be calculated for each block. The last option, Automatic, allows the encoder to choose the prediction mode&#160;&#8212;&#160;either Spatial or Temporal&#160;&#8212;&#160;depending on the situation. Spatial is HandBrake&#8217;s default and the recommended choice, though Automatic will provide a small compression gain with an accordingly small increase in encoding time.</p>

<p>When estimating motion between blocks, the encoder has a variety of search patterns at its disposal. The Motion Estimation Method dropdown menu within the Analysis section allows you to choose from a list of five different search patterns listed in the order of fastest to slowest, least precise to greatest precision: Diamond, Hexagon, Uneven Multi-Hexagon, Exhaustive, and Transform Exhaustive. Diamond uses a diamond-shaped search pattern for detecting motion, whereas Hexagon is able to produce more accurate results by using a hexagonal search pattern, at the cost of some speed. Uneven Multi-Hexagon uses multiple complex search patterns to more accurately capture complex motion, and is thus slower than each of the previously mentioned settings. Exhaustive does not use a search pattern and instead compares each pixel, significantly lengthening the time required for conversion with a reportedly small compression gain. Finally, Transform Exhaustive is the most accurate setting for estimating motion and requires more time than all the other settings. Transform Exhaustive offers a small compression gain over Exhaustive.</p>

<p>By default HandBrake uses the Hexagon pattern, which is fine for most applications. If you <em>really</em> need the boost in encoding speed, Diamond is your best bet, though it will produce sub-optimal results. Conversely, if the speed of the encode is irrelevant to you, using Transform Exhaustive will produce the clearest video at the smallest file size of all the options presented above.</p>

<p>With motion estimation being one of the greatest advantages of the H.264 video codec over most other codecs, it is not surprising that there is yet another setting for improving the accuracy of motion estimation. Subpixel ME &#38; Mode Decision allows you to set the precision of sub-pixel motion estimation, which allows the encoder to refine motion estimates beyond pixel measurements into fractional measurements. By refining the measurements in this manner a greater amount of compression can be applied to the video. A lower value in this field will result in a faster encode, though at the cost of size and quality. A higher value, on the other hand, will produce a sharper video at a smaller size, though at the cost of conversion speed. HandBrake&#8217;s default for this setting is six out of ten: this is acceptable for most applications.</p>

<p>The Adaptive Quantization Strength slider controls how the encoder will distribute bits across each frame. A default value of zero will cause the encoder to distribute bits evenly across the screen, whereas higher values place more emphasis on the center of the frame by placing fewer bits around the edges and increasing the number of bits in the center.</p>

<p>The third and final column in the Advanced tab starts off with the Partition Type setting. This setting controls the number of partitions that will be considered by the encoder during the encoding process. HandBrake automatically turns this feature on, and it is recommended that either the default setting or All be used as this will improve compression.</p>

<p>Turning on Trellis can improve the compression of your video by between 3-5%, though at the cost of encoding speed, especially at higher bitrates. HandBrake provides three settings for the trellis: Off, which turns trellis off for the conversion; Encode Only, allowing trellis only during the video encode; and Always. Always allows trellis to be applied during both the video&#8217;s scan and during the encoder, which results in an even greater decrease in size.</p>

<p>The last setting in the Advanced tab helps to smooth out blocking artifacts after each frame is decoded by applying a filter to the video during playback. The aggressiveness of the filter is set with the first dropdown menu, with a lower value corresponding to a small amount of deblocking and a higher value applying a greater amount of deblocking. Below the strength menu, the second dropdown menu allows you to select the number of edges this filter applies to: a lower value means fewer edges, while a higher value means a greater number of edges will be effected. Since this filter is being applied during playback though, it is fairly CPU intensive and therefore not recommended for devices with small processing power such as iPods or other portable media players.</p>

<p>Despite my earlier claim, HandBrake actually contains nine tabs: in addition to the eight described above, one additional tab, Query Editor, can be enabled in HandBrake&#8217;s Options screen. Once enabled in &#8220;Advanced&#8221;, HandBrake will require a restart, and upon opening again will contain the ninth tab: Query Editor. HandBrake is, quite simply, a graphical user interface&#160;&#8212;&#160;a wrapper, if you will, used for setting parameters which are then passed to the command-line interface. The Query Editor tab strips away part of the wall between the two worlds by providing for the manual modification of the CLI query prior to adding a video to the queue. From this view, the CLI query can be edited to suit your needs. Note, though, that none of the changes made in the Query Editor will be reflected in the main interface, and clicking the &#8220;Generate Query&#8221; button will reset the query to the values set through the GUI. So for example, if you modified the output width in the Query Editor to be 600 pixels instead of the 800 pixels set in the Picture tab, the Picture tab would still contain a value of 800 in the Width field, and clicking &#8220;Generate Query&#8221; would change the 600 back to 800, as well as undo any other changes made to the CLI query. The Query Editor does, however, override the parameters set through the GUI when adding the video to the queue though: going back to the example of having set a width of 600 pixels for the video in the Query Editor tab, regardless of the Width field&#8217;s value, the video will be added to the queue with an output width of 600 pixels.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ThePresetsSection">The Presets Section<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ThePresetsSection">#</a></span></h4>
<p>Located on the far right side of HandBrake&#8217;s main window, the Presets section contains a list of built-in presets as well as any custom presets you may have created. In HandBrake, a preset is simply a collection of conversion settings that can be loaded with the click of a button. Settings such as resolution, video and audio codecs, and even advanced conversion parameters can all be stored within a preset and applied to any video. The main benefit of a preset becomes apparent when you begin to use HandBrake often: every once in a while opening the Video tab to change the codec, to customize the resolution in the Picture tab, and modify some of the more advanced settings in the Advanced tab is not a big deal; however, doing this more than a few times is both time consuming and annoying. Enter presets: by creating a saving a preset you can automatically load these settings with a single click rather than manually modifying the conversion parameters each time you open HandBrake, saving you both time and frustration. HandBrake comes with a number of built-in presets: seven for converting videos specifically for Apple devices, four for general purpose video conversions, and two presets designed to suit the Android platform.</p>

<p>You are not limited to the presets bundled with HandBrake though. Creating a preset is actually quite easy: simply add a video to HandBrake and change the conversion parameters to match your requirements. Next, click the Add button at the bottom of the Presets section. A window will pop up prompting you to name the preset. Note that custom presets are stored at the bottom of the Presets window, beneath the built-in presets, in alphabetical order, with numerical names first. Once you have decided on and entered a name for your preset there are two more fields to be considered before you click Add at the bottom of the window. The first field, labeled Use Picture Size, has thee options: None, Source Maximum, and Custom. Choose None if you do not want the resolution currently set in the Picture tab to be saved in the preset. If you do want to save the resolution in the preset though, select Source Maximum. Choosing Custom allows you to input a height and width for HandBrake to match whenever this preset is applied. The checkbox beneath the Use Picture Size menu, Save Filter Settings, will, if checked, store the current video filter settings in the preset. Click Add to save the preset. It will now appear in black letters at the bottom of the Presets window.</p>

<p>HandBrake is considered by many to be the most powerful video transcoder available to date. This guide has given you the knowledge necessary to begin using this powerhouse application by teaching you the basics&#160;&#8212;&#160;how to get HandBrake up and running on your machine, and how to use HandBrake to transcode a video. After reading this guide, the reason behind HandBrake&#8217;s esteemed position should be very clear: not only does it facilitate for the utilization of the H.264 video codec, considered by many to be the most versatile video codec currently available, but also provides a higher level of control when defining a conversion than any other video transcoder currently available. In combination, these two points, and especially the latter, make HandBrake the application of choice for thousands of people around the world. Check back often for my next article, which should go live within a day or two, and for the next installment of this article when HandBrake eventually adopts H.264&#8217;s successor, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding">H.265</a> video codec.</p>

<p>&#8220;People who know a little bit of statistics - enough to use statistical techniques, not enough to understand why or how they work - often end up horribly misusing them. Statistical tests are complicated mathematical techniques, and to work, they tend to make numerous assumptions. The problem is that if those assumptions are not valid, most statistical tests do not cleanly fail and produce obviously false results.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first of what I believe will be a long series of fascinating articles from Less Wrong. A great piece on <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/useless-correlations.html">statistical correlations</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I lose pride in something, I stop caring about it being good. Its only value to me is as something that I one day won&#8217;t have to do anymore. It always starts with the cutting of one small corner, but that&#8217;s all it takes. Pandora&#8217;s Box is open and the feature is infected. I cut the next corner with only a faint pang of remorse, and after that I don&#8217;t even notice the corners anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great article and an astute observation not only applicable in the professional world, but throughout our lives as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stress this enough: Do what you love...in between work commitments, and family commitments, and commitments that tend to pop up and take immediate precedence over doing the thing you love. Because the bottom line is that life is short, and you owe it to yourself to spend the majority of it giving yourself wholly and completely to something you absolutely hate, and 20 minutes here and there doing what you feel you were put on this earth to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>A surprisingly excellent article from The Onion that has gained quite a bit of traction since it was posted.

<p>After listening to the fifty-ninth episode of Roderick on the Line, I found the speech written for the president should astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become stranded on the moon. It would be a lonely way to go, sitting on the moon, staring at Earth a few hundred thousand miles away as their oxygen slowly depleted and they suffocated. It would have been a terrible way to go.</p>

<p>The iPad Mini, like the original iPad, launched to the tune of naysayers questioning the usefulness of a tablet in general, and especially one in such a form factor. After all, who could use the iPad for actual work? It was obviously a content-consumption device rather than a device capable of creating new and interesting things. Obviously. But now we have the iPad 4, and now we have the iPad Mini. And now we have two new ways to create whenever and wherever is convenient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Using an iPad mini was like switching from a 17&#8217;&#8216; MacBook Pro to an 11&#8217;&#8217; MacBook Air &#160;&#8212;&#160; all of a sudden you can use the device in far more places than you ever thought possible and still do almost everything you wanted to do on it.

<p>Paul Miller occasionally sends out dispatches, as The Verge calls them, articles about one thing or another penned by a writer who has forsaken the internet for an entire year. His last piece I read, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3955678/offline-love-loss-dating-without-facebook"><em>Offline: Love, Loss, and Dating Without Facebook</em></a>, was interesting only insofar as a story about an anticlimactic love endeavor can be; his latest article, linked at the top of this post, is much, much better. As Paul chronicled his difficulties finding the motivation to make good use of his newfound time, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/increasingly-prevalent-realistic-and-irrelevant.html">I couldn&#8217;t help but relate</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;These don&#8217;t make for catchy book titles:</p>

<p>* How To Disconnect From Reality In 365 Days</p>
<p>* At First I Liked Not Using The Internet But Then It Got Kind Of Sucky&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul&#8217;s piece made me laugh and it prompted introspection. If nothing else, if not for the great story, read the piece as a shining example of excellent prose.</p>

<p>A few days ago <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/what-if-the-google-reader-readers-just-dont-come-back.html">I linked to</a> <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/26/google-reader-readers">Marco Arment&#8217;s response</a> to MG Siegler&#8217;s post <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/24/bees/"><em>What If The Google Reader Readers Just Don&#8217;t Come Back?</em></a> without actually reading MG&#8217;s article. I got around to reading it this morning though, and he made a few interesting&#160;&#8212;&#160;albeit tired&#160;&#8212;&#160;points that merit some discussion.</p>

<p>First, MG very eloquently compared Google Reader and its users to a flower and honey bees, conjecturing as to the importance of the relatively small user base Reader laid claim to prior to the announcement of its impending demise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The first is that Reader&#8217;s users, while again, relatively small in number, are hugely influential in the spread of news around the web. In a sense, Reader is the flower that allows the news bees to pollinate the social web. You know all those links you click on and re-share on Twitter and Facebook? They have to first be found somewhere, by someone. And I&#8217;d guess a lot of that discovery happens by news junkies using Reader.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took issue with this statement on two levels: first in MG&#8217;s assumption that a great portion of Reader&#8217;s users are &#8220;hugely influential&#8221;, a statement I found curious in the face of all the articles talking about how so-and-so&#8217;s less-technically-inclined family member bemoaned the service&#8217;s passing despite Reader&#8217;s portrayal as a niche market player, and second when he suggested that we have some semblance of influence: as much as we like to think we have some power over these companies, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich">we don&#8217;t</a>. If that hint was too subtle, go read Marco&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich"><em>Your Favorite Thursday Sandwich</em></a> for a bit of perspective on the issue. The final point I want to make before moving on is that Reader is not the only service of its kind out there: Feedly and Newsblur, positioned as Reader replacements <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/google-readers-mass-exodus.html">gained a combined total of more than half a million users in just a few days</a>. There is no shortage of flowers, to adopt MG&#8217;s metaphor, and Readers users&#160;&#8212;&#160;bees, in MG&#8217;s parlance&#160;&#8212;&#160;quickly moved; the question, though, is how many will be lost in the transition?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;But the second reason worries me even more because it&#8217;s more quantifiable. By killing Reader, Google is likely to harm a lot of publishers, large and small, by eliminating a larger source of traffic.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will proceed as if everyone else on the internet has not already made this argument multiple times over. It is a valid fear, after all, losing one of the largest sources of traffic. Therein lies the real problem we will face in the coming months leading up to July first as more people move to other, comparable services, and following July first when those who remain must either vanish altogether or finally make the switch.</p>

<p>Something I found in a note almost lost in the sea that is the host of half-baked ideas begging to be honed to a comprehensible piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of things I have had to learn to be okay with over the past few weeks. Things like a much more structured day, consistent late nights out, and going to the gym less often that I would like, for example, or much less significant things like writing when I have time rather than when I want to write, or saying no to things I don&#8217;t have time for, even if I&#8217;ve already started doing that thing I now realize I need to say no to.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have devoted a lot of time to thinking about this, curious as to my motivations behind writing. In the past I said I wrote because I wanted to share my knowledge with others. How noble of me, I suppose. At other times, simply because I love the writer&#8217;s craft. This was closer to the real reason, but neither, while true on some level, accurately represented the actual drive that has pushed me to come home after a long day and sit down to write rather than collapse in my bed, the motivation necessary to make that seven-to-eleven-o&#8217;clock&#160;&#8212;&#160;or ten-to-midnight, as is the case here&#160;&#8212;&#160;side project a viable business.</p>

<p>I write because I don&#8217;t want to sit in an office for eight to ten hours a day doing anything. I write because I want the freedom writing permits as one of the few things I can do anywhere in the world at whatever time I feel so inclined to put pen to paper, so to speak. I write because I love the writer&#8217;s craft. I don&#8217;t write for pageviews; the number of pageviews I get&#160;&#8212;&#160;incidentally very few, in case you were wondering&#160;&#8212;&#160;is a by-product of this and nothing more, not the driving force behind my fascination and love of this craft.</p>

<p>Sometimes distractions are good. At the end of a long day spent working on homework, for example, being productive is the last thing I want to do: I would much rather relax and watch a movie than write. Other days, though, during the summer or over break, those are the days I should spend in Instapaper, reading, and in Drafts, writing. But more often than not, those two different types of days that for all intents and purposes should remain separate blend together, and I end up taking the easier path, at the end of which I find myself after two hours having accomplished quite literally nothing as my character in whatever game most recently struck my fancy is once again shot and killed.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I overhead a conversation in which one individual asked another if he played games on his sleek new ultrabook, to which the former replied that he did not: he preferred to spend his time on things with concrete, worthwhile outcomes. A badge or level in a game meant nothing to him. The conversation floundered at that point and eventually died. After all, what could have been said in response to something like that?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s asinine, this fatal attraction to the literally mindless forms of entertainment. Sure, I suppose one could make the case for increased reaction time, pattern recognition, and super-human powers&#160;&#8212;&#160;well, maybe not the last one&#160;&#8212;&#160;resulting from continued preoccupation with the increasingly prevalent, realistic, and irrelevant digital worlds, but at the end of the day, when I close the lid of my laptop and wrench my body from near-complete stasis, I have to face the cold reality of having wasted an entire day with absolutely nothing to show for it.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-03-25 12:34:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-03.html">03</a>/25 12:34:51 EST</time>
<p>In the past few months I have written many essays necessitating the use of citations as a manner through which to lend credence to some datum or another. As you may have surmised from this article&#8217;s title though, I believe the current model for determining credible citations to be broken. Take, for example, XKCD comic #976, <a href="http://xkcd.com/978/">Citogenesis</a>. In this comic, Randal Munroe once again displays brilliance by showing <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/11/16/xkcd-explains-where-internet-citations-come-from/">where citations come from</a>.</p>

<p>When an author writes a book, he or she is not required to cite their sources. The author does indeed have a certain obligation to present true facts to the reader, but disregarding that obligation&#160;&#8212;&#160;depending on the degree to which it is done&#160;&#8212;&#160;will not necessarily prevent a book from being released to the public if those errors are not caught by the editor. In fact, even on the web, writers are not required to cite their sources. Take The Next Web&#8217;s article <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2012/05/14/how-3-simple-buttons-raised-tipping-by-144-million-in-nyc-cabs/">How 3 simple buttons raised tipping by $144 million in NYC cabs</a>, <a href="http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/23049725899/plagiarism">plagiarized</a> from Joshua Gross&#8217; post <a href="http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/22958656041/the-144-146-165-button">The $144,146,165 Button</a>, for example, which <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html">I wrote about</a> quite some time ago.</p>

<p>As authors craft their montage of thoughts into a comprehensible written volume, most do their best to ensure correct information. However, such a goal is only possible to a certain extent when conducting original research, so especially in this case errors are likely to find their way into the finished product. Short of a re-publication though, a costly and slow process, nothing can be done to remedy this happenstance, and thus erroneous information presents itself as fact. The same principle applies to online publication as well: an author can write and publish anything he or she wishes. The degree to which that information must be proved reliable through a credible source depends on the venue through which the content is posted. Personal blogs and websites, for example, by and large do not operate under any oversight; larger publications, on the other hand, do, though&#160;&#8212;&#160;as Joshua Gross&#8217; plagiarized article demonstrates&#160;&#8212;&#160;this system is far from perfect.</p>

<p>All this is in an attempt to make one point: although less so online, both physical and online publications are not infallible; it is possible for an author, knowingly or otherwise, to pass incorrect information as fact through one of these mediums, after which it is up to the readers to catch this flaw or miss it and, as time goes on, lend credence to this false idea through inaction. This is the point Randall Munroe humorously made in the comic strip cited at the beginning of this article, Citogenesis, and leads me to the main topic of this article: Wikipedia and its ridiculous persecution by academia. To reiterate one of my opening lines, I believe the current model for determining credible citations to be broken.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a short essay comparing the life of the Hispanic knight El Cid to Spain&#8217;s struggle to expel the Muslim horde. In order to write that paper, I spent quite some time conducting research both into the life of Rodrigo de Vivar and the struggle for the control of Spain. One of the most interesting resources I stumbled across during this research was a page on Princeton&#8217;s website providing information for the Battle of Covadonga. It was not the information contained within it that interested me though, but rather the nondescript byline at the bottom of the page: &#8220;The article content of this page came from Wikipedia and is governed by CC-BY-SA.&#8221; The Princeton website scraped the first five paragraphs from the Wikipedia article and passed it off as its own content which, in an MLA citation, would have appeared as credible&#160;&#8212;&#160;if not more credible&#160;&#8212;&#160;than any of the other websites I referenced. In truth though, the information would have been <em>exactly the same</em> whether I had taken it from Wikipedia or Princeton. Exactly the same. Unfortunately, this short anecdote just scratches the surface of a system permeated with an incorrectly justified aversion to a resource that should be embraced rather than spurned.</p>

<p>I could create and publish a respectable website in a matter of minutes on any number of free blogging platforms, the contents of which would be completely subject to my discretion. I could, for example, claim to be a respected chemist and state that a molecule of hydrogen is an anabolic compound consisting of the Higgs-Boson particle, held together with dark matter. With a plausible &#8220;About&#8221; page backing up this false claim, an unsuspecting chemistry student could take this completely false fact and cite it properly as a truth, at which point who is to blame? The chemistry student for lacking the faculties to recognize that &#8220;fact&#8221; as an untruth, a shortcoming that brought that student, pursuant of more knowledge on the matter, to my fake website in the first place? I hope you realize how ridiculous it would be to blame the student for this, and I hope these examples highlight the point I am trying so desperately to make in this post.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no solution though: the system itself is not an imperfect one; under the proper circumstances, it actually works quite well. It is under any other circumstances, however, that its shortcomings become evident, and it is in those situations that the need for some alternative is most dire. This is a call to find that alternative, and a call to stop banning the free encyclopedia.</p>

<p>John Siracusa explaining Apple&#8217;s aversion to outsourcing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Like a lover who&#8217;s been betrayed one too many times, Apple has hardened its corporate heart against any form of true partnership. If it&#8217;s important, Apple wants to own and control it. When Apple does work with others, it insists on having the upper hand. iOS developers serve at the pleasure of Apple. Manufacturing partners must fight for the privilege of building Apple&#8217;s products, often using equipment Apple purchases for them. And, of course, Apple has its own mobile OS that runs exclusively on its own hardware.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple is often criticized by its detractors for its refusal to rely&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8220;work with&#8221;, as it is often so mildly put&#160;&#8212;&#160;other companies. Given its past experiences though, how could we possibly blame them?</p>

<p>Marco Arment in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich"><em>Your favorite Thursday sandwich</em></a>, where he argued against Om Malik&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">decision not to use Google Keep</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In this business, you can&#8217;t count on anything having longevity. To avoid new services that are likely to get shut down within a few years, you&#8217;d have to avoid every new tech product. Products and services lasting more than a few years are the exception, not the rule.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while I feel he does make a valid point, Marco overlooked a key difference between Google and every new tech product: Google has done this in the past and will do it again: this is not the first time they have closed the doors on a product we love, nor will it be the last. That&#8217;s the difference here. That&#8217;s the problem. Unfortunately though, Marco is right: everyone will continue to use Google&#8217;s products despite this uncertainty. Sure, a few may take a principled stand like Om Malik did, but at the end of the day, it won&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>I was talking to my girlfriend a few days ago when, in passing, she mentioned a conversation between her and one of her friends earlier that day. Her friend, she said, didn&#8217;t expect much of her boyfriend: she didn&#8217;t expect him to give her presents or bring her flowers; they weren&#8217;t needed&#160;&#8212;&#160;her words, not mine. I didn&#8217;t think too much of it at the time, but it stuck with me throughout the day until I sat down and wrote about it here.</p>

<p>It struck me, all of the sudden, just how sad that was: here this girl was giving this boy her time and attention and&#160;&#8212;&#160;maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;love, and she expected so little in return. That&#8217;s so sad. So very, very sad. Mixed with the sadness I felt was the inability to understand this mentality on both parts: the girl&#8217;s that she would expect so little, and the boy&#8217;s that he would do so little. I&#8217;m not saying he should buy her expensive gifts all the time and bring her flowers on their first date, but he should hold the door open, pay for dinner, surprise her with flowers when she least expects it, and brighten a bad day with a thoughtful gift. He doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect, but he can at least care&#160;&#8212;&#160;he can at least be a gentleman about it.</p>

<p>After finishing the backlog of Critical Path episodes early yesterday afternoon, I scrolled down through <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/too-many-podcasts.html">my extensive list of podcasts</a> until I came to <em>The Talk Show With John Gruber</em>. After <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/regarding-the-talk-show.html">my initial impressions</a> of John Gruber&#8217;s latest work, I did not expect to particularly enjoy the next hour and a half. Like my previous encounters with John Gruber&#8217;s work, however, where it took a number of tries to discover the value of The Talk Show while it aired in 5by5, the third time was the charm: I am once again hooked on John&#8217;s podcast. I gave The Talk Show a third chance, and I suggest all of you who, like me, recoiled so violently from everything John Gruber in the wake of the move to the Mule Radio Syndicate, give The Talk Show another chance: it&#8217;s not quite as good as it used to be, but it&#8217;s still The Talk Show.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-03-21 09:26:59-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-03.html">03</a>/21 09:26:59 EST</time>
<p>Since John Gruber abruptly announced that The Talk Show would move from 5by5 to the Mule Radio Syndicate a few months ago, many have speculated as to the reasons behind this sudden and unexpected split while both John and Dan remained, for the most part, silent. Twitter exploded with questions, theories, and, in some cases, anger; bloggers wrote long articles filled with speculation; Philip Elmer-DeWitt, writing for CNN Money, even entered the conversation with an uncharacteristically unemotional <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/19/john-gruber-jumps-ship/">article</a> for the topic; however, to this day John and Dan are the only two who know the actual cause for the split. Here I will aggregate the most common discussions and the strongest theories in an attempt at discerning the underlying cause for this unfortunate rift, using this topic as a manner through which to discuss the Mule Radio Syndicate of which I have many opinions on. I originally intended to incorporate this discussion into my post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/5by5.html"><em>5by5</em></a>, but following the announcement that both Hypercritical and Build &#38; Analyze would close their doors before the year&#8217;s end I chose to pause, step back, thank Dan, Marco, and John for the excellent work, and give a brief history of 5by5 and its impact on the podcasting industry. Separating these two articles also gave me the opportunity to fully explore all the possibilities of this unfortunate happenstance.</p>

<p>In preparation for and throughout the time I spent writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/5by5.html"><em>5by5</em></a>, I attempted to learn more about both the history of The Talk Show and the Mule Radio Syndicate in order to possibly better understand the reasons behind John Gruber leaving 5by5. While I was able to find information regarding The Talk Show relatively easily through <a href="http://wiki.5by5.tv/wiki/The_Talk_Show">its page on the 5by5 wiki</a> and answer many of my questions by recounting the life of the podcast on 5by5, information on the Mule Radio Syndicate has continued to elude me. Aside from <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/andrea-seabrook-from-npr-to-podcasting-hoping-to-invigorate-congressional-reporting/">a passing mention</a> in the occasional news article and what little information regarding the network is provided on <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/">the website</a>, few facts regarding this network are publicly available. Opinions, on the other hand, are in no short supply. Take these comments in response to John&#8217;s announcement that The Talk Show would be moving, for example: from reader <a href="http://daringfireballwithcomments.net/web/linked/2012/05/18/the-talk-show#comment5037">DDA</a>: &#8220;Wow, this sucks. I was hoping to avoid <em>any[thing]</em> related to Mule Design, given the sexist comments from Mike.&#8221; Another user, <a href="http://daringfireballwithcomments.net/web/linked/2012/05/18/the-talk-show#comment5043">Tim</a>, continues analogously: &#8220;Ugh, that guy Monteiro&#8217;s schtick is so old and tired. &#8216;Dig me, I&#8217;m that ironic, rude, 80&#8217;s indie music guy from Philly&#8217;.&#8221; Although I cannot speak to the personality of Mike Monteiro as I do not know him personally, based on the tweets he made in response to the widespread negative feedback in the days following John&#8217;s announcement&#160;&#8212;&#160;many of which can be found in the May 19 update <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">here</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would tend to agree with Mike&#8217;s critics.</p>

<p>So why, then, did John leave 5by5 after more than ninety episodes and nearly two years, not including <a href="http://thetalkshow.net">the show&#8217;s previous incarnation</a> of which Dan Benjamin was also a part of? <a href="http://daringfireballwithcomments.net/web/linked/2012/05/18/the-talk-show#comment5048">McGruber</a> theorizes that the move was a result of another podcast&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely Hypercritical&#160;&#8212;&#160;beating The Talk Show in weekly downloads; no longer the top podcast on the network, McGruber proposes that John moved his podcast in order to be #1 once again. Of the more nefarious explanations I consider this one of the less likely as I do not believe Gruber to be quite that petty; however, I cannot discard the idea as an underlying motivation behind the move. Possibly the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, so to speak.</p>

<p>Jonathan Poritsky of <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/">The Candler Blog</a> made a number of posts to his website regarding The Talk Show&#8217;s departure from 5by5, the first of which, <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/18/where-did-the-talk-show-go/">Why Did John Gruber&#8217;s Talk Show Leave 5by5?</a>, delves deeply into some of the possible causes behind the falling-out, of which he is sure was the cause of the egress to the Mule Radio Syndicate. Before I begin to dissect those arguments though, I would like to point out a particular observation in Jonathan Poritsky&#8217;s assessment of the controversy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Talk Show always had two hosts. Dan Benjamin helped keep the show on track when Gruber would wander off and riff. This new show lacks that structure and is instantly less enjoyable to listen to. I&#8217;ll certainly give the new Talk Show a chance, but Dan will be sorely missed. The show didn&#8217;t really hinge on either of them; they made a perfect team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as many others do. Having struggled through a few of the first episodes of The Talk Show&#8217;s third incarnation, I can provide first-hand evidence regarding the validity of this statement: without Dan, the show is certainly less enjoyable to listen to. Whether because John is much more apt to go off on a tangent, because there&#8217;s just no spark, or because John <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3995317">butchers the ad reading</a>, the absence of Dan is palpable&#160;&#8212;&#160;the elephant in the room. Jonathan&#8217;s article originally ended with that sub-par review of the latest Talk Show, though since then it has been updated numerous times to include further discussion of possible motives behind the divorce.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="TheAwkwardSignOff">The Awkward Sign-Off<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TheAwkwardSignOff">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Many people have cited <a href="http://soundcloud.com/poritsky/john-grubers-last-talk-show">the &#8220;awkward&#8221; ending</a> to the last episode of The Talk Show on 5by5, episode #90, as a hint of the split announced roughly two weeks later. I disagree with this theory. The Talk Show often ended as it began: abruptly; further, John was never one to prolong goodbyes or provide a prelude to them, just as was the case in this episode. Although in hindsight this ending could be considered as a precursor to the split, viewing it as anything other than a normal Talk Show ending is reading into it too much. Joshua Almanshofer of &#8220;You Call That...&#8221; shared a similar point of view in his article <a href="http://youcallthat.posterous.com/a-breakup"><em>A Breakup</em></a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Money">Money<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Money">#</a></span></h3>

<p>One very common theory explaining the fallout between Dan and John states that it was the result of a disagreement over money. Some say that the manner through which 5by5 handles t-shirt sales, which is to sell different shirts at intermittent intervals throughout the year, clashed with John&#8217;s production strategy, thereby creating some friction between Dan and John. Others speculate&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Jonathan Poritsky mentioned this in his article as well&#160;&#8212;&#160;that the release of the new 5by5 Radio app under &#8220;Benjamin Productions&#8221; rather than through &#8220;5by5 Productions&#8221; could have created some tension not only between John and Dan, but between Dan and some of the other hosts at 5by5 as well. Although the app description has since been updated to name 5by5 Productions, LLC as the seller of the app, <a href="http://blog.5by5.tv/2012/5/16/5by5-radio-for-ios">when announced on May 11th</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;one week before John made <a href="http://daringfireball.net//linked/2012/05/18/the-talk-show">the post announcing that The Talk Show would leave 5by5</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;the description <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/05/quickadvice-5by5radio">did indeed name Benjamin Productions as the seller</a>. Initially I disregarded this theory as ridiculous, but the more I considered it the more convinced I became that this was not only a plausible explanation, but also a likely one. This is why&#160;&#8212;&#160;and keep in mind, this is based on speculation, not hard facts: Dan released the official 5by5 Radio app through what we can probably safely assume to be his personal account. Being his personal app developer account, all revenue from app sales&#160;&#8212;&#160;which are driven, mind you, by the popularity of the shows he <em>co</em>-hosts&#160;&#8212;&#160;would have been deposited into his personal bank account. Once the money was deposited into his account, there was no guarantee that any of the other hosts shared in that revenue stream. As an anonymous Quora poster stated in <a href="http://www.quora.com/The-Talk-Show/Why-did-John-Grubers-The-Talk-Show-switch-podcast-networks/answers/1227036">a comment regarding the move</a>, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any hosts are receiving a cut of that money.&#8221; Given Dan&#8217;s friendly, easy-going attitude I am hesitant to even speculate as to the possibility of such an act, but the possibility does exist and could very well have been one of the reasons John moved to the Mule Radio Syndicate. Discrediting this theory is the fact that the Mule Radio iOS app is free, meaning that John does not benefit any more from app sales at the Syndicate than if Dan had refused to share the revenue with his co-hosts. Given the possibility of Dan refusing to spread the app revenue between his co-hosts though, leaving 5by5 could have been John&#8217;s response to that decision based on the principle of the matter rather than simply due to the loss of what would have undoubtedly been a meager source of income, which clearly is not a deal-breaker as illustrated by the Syndicate offering their app for free and John&#8217;s wholehearted participation in that network.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that today the 5by5 Radio app&#8217;s description names &#8220;5by5 Productions, LLC&#8221; as the seller, leaving us to wonder if availability under &#8220;Benjamin Productions&#8221; was a temporary arrangement until a developer account could be set up for 5by5. Alternately, the creation of an app developer account belonging to 5by5 Productions could have been in response to John&#8217;s reaction; if that&#8217;s the case, we are then left to wonder if Gruber was the only one to raise an objection to the handling of this situation, or if his argument had the support of other 5by5 co-hosts as well.</p>

<p>Some also believe that sponsorship revenue could have been a sore topic between Dan and John as well. To reference the anonymous Quora user once again, &#8220;Gruber posts a list of the talk show sponsors on Daring Fireball each week. This is worth almost as much as the daring fireball sponsorship which he currently sells for $7500 a week.&#8221; We can safely assume that since these sponsorship slots and their prices were posted shortly after The Talk Show&#8217;s departure from 5by5, this figure was close to or slightly less than the going rate for an ad slot while the show called 5by5 home. Raising the price would have made little sense especially giving the change in networks, and John had no reason to lower the price as he was apparently operating under the assumption that nowhere near as much backlash and negative press would follow the announcement. I will discuss this assumption shortly. Unfortunately for Gruber though many did respond negatively to the announcement, a large majority of which were bloggers of varying calibers who decided to write about the move. For the most part, they were not kind in their opinions.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that now sponsorships on The Talk Show sell for $2500, a $5000 decrease <em>per ad slot</em>. This decrease means that in any given episode of The Talk Show&#8217;s third incarnation, John earns, on average, $10,000 less. That&#8217;s a huge amount. Maybe someday we will see that figure back at $7500 per slot, but, as I will explain shortly, I believe this to be unlikely.</p>

<p>Before continuing, let&#8217;s discuss the reasons that The Talk Show&#8217;s move to The Mule Radio Syndicate may have initially solved the problem of sponsorship revenue between Dan and John. As I said earlier, John began handling sponsorships for the new Talk Show just as he does sponsorships for his website: by posting open slots and prices on Daringfireball.net. Choosing to handle sponsorships in this manner rather than through the Syndicate&#8217;s website as they are handled now indicates that John may have wished to handle the sponsorships of his podcast personally rather than leaving it to Dan. Additionally, posting prices and open slots on his personal website also indicates that Mike may have not shared in the ad revenue of The Talk Show. Part of the agreement between John and Mike could have outlined a deal in which Gruber came to The Mule Radio Syndicate in name only as a manner through which to raise the notoriety of the network. In exchange for releasing his podcast through the Syndicate&#8217;s feeds, John would keep the sponsorship revenue from his podcast rather than sharing it with Mike as the podcasting business model Dan built and other podcast producers adopted dictated. With the unexpectedly strong negative reaction and accordingly large drop in popularity, however, John and Mike apparently re-negotiated this deal to place Mike in charge of sponsorships in return for a share in the ad revenue.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Compensation">Compensation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Compensation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Some question exists as to whether John made Dan and the 5by5 network fanatically popular, or whether the reverse is true for John and Daringfireball.net through The Talk Show and 5by5. Given the notoriety of John Gruber and his blog even back when The Talk Show was brought to 5by5 in 2010 compared to the popularity of Dan&#8217;s fledgling 5by5 brand though, John was undoubtedly one of the main driving forces behind the network&#8217;s growth in popularity, especially in the first few years. A popular explanation for the divorce between Dan and John theorizes that John asked to be compensated for his exceptional contribution to 5by5&#8217;s success, and that Dan refused. Some say Gruber wished to be compensated with a larger paycheck than the other hosts received, while others speculate that Gruber asked for a stake in 5by5 in return for his help bringing the network to success. As the previously cited anonymous Quora commenter states <a href="http://www.quora.com/The-Talk-Show/Why-did-John-Grubers-The-Talk-Show-switch-podcast-networks/answers/1227036">in his post</a>, &#8220;It&#8217;s very possible that Gruber said that since he played a major role in the current success of 5by5, that he should be compensated more than any of the other hosts. I also believe Gruber asked for a percentage stake in 5by5 and Dan refused.&#8221; It is worth pointing out here that simply due to The Talk Show&#8217;s popularity Gruber would have received a larger paycheck than most, if not all, other hosts. However, Gruber may have asked for greater compensation not due to his show&#8217;s popularity but instead due to the integral role he played in 5by5&#8217;s success. The anonymous commenter continues: &#8220;Gruber approached Mike and said give me a stake in Mule, and I&#8217;ll do for you, what I did for 5by5.&#8221; The general consensus is that while Dan may have agreed to the former, he rejected the latter; as a result, John left 5by5 for the Syndicate, where Mike Monteiro offered Gruber the one thing Dan would not: a stake in the network.</p>

<p>Dan was not totally in the wrong though. Suppose he had given Gruber a stake in 5by5 in return for helping to craft the 5by5 brand. Supposing Gruber would have been satisfied, The Talk Show would have remained on 5by5. Now suppose that a month later Hypercritical, continuing its trend of growing popularity, surpassed The Talk Show as the most popular show on 5by5. After a month in the #1 spot, John Siracusa approaches Dan and asks for a stake in 5by5 as well, given the extreme popularity of his show and the growth is has contributed to the network over the past month. What grounds would Dan have for refusal of this request? Gruber was undoubtedly one of the main reasons 5by5 has grown to such stature in the past three years. John Siracusa could argue the same point, saying that his show has contributed equally to the profitability and growth of the network. Having given Gruber a stake in 5by5, Dan would have little choice but to comply with John Siracusa&#8217;s hypothetical request. Fast-forward another month or two, and Back to Work is vying for the top spot on 5by5. Another month passes, and Back to Work beats Hypercritcal out of that top spot, and then the cycle repeats once again with Merlin. I do not mean to say that either John or Merlin would intentionally put Dan in this position, but as the co-hosts of two of the most popular broadcasts on 5by5, the possibility exists both for these two hosts as well as hosts to come. Using stake in 5by5 as a reward for facilitating growth, regardless of how large, is impractical; Dan was in the right to refuse.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="UnforeseenEffects">Unforeseen Effects<span>&nbsp;<a href="#UnforeseenEffects">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Now that we have examined some of the more popular theories attempting to explain John taking The Talk Show to a competing network, it is time to discuss some of the effects this move has had on 5by5, The Talk Show, and The Mule Radio Syndicate. First of all, I do not believe the loss of The Talk Show was a crippling blow to 5by5. Granted the announcement obviously took Dan by surprise and the move almost certainly took with it a certain number of listeners, but given the overlap between listeners of The Talk Show and at least one other 5by5 podcast, it is unlikely that 5by5 lost a significant number of listeners with The Talk Show&#8217;s departure.</p>

<p>I titled this section &#8220;Unforseen Effects&#8221; because I believe John jumped ship without fully considering a number of things. I believe he assumed that he would be able to do for The Mule Radio Syndicate what he did for 5by5 in the early years using the established Talk Show brand: make it extraordinarily popular. I also believe he underestimated the general dislike of Mike Monteiro and The Mule Radio Syndicate. These two errors are grave indeed, and have cost The Talk Show popularity and John a significant amount of money.</p>

<p>The podcasting industry was a different place two years ago when The Talk Show moved to 5by5, seven months after Dan began broadcasting. Back then the market was nowhere nearly as developed as it is today: podcasting was a fringe medium; there were no established podcasting networks of note; what Dan and John were trying to do was revolutionary. Other podcast producers began to take notice as 5by5 began growing in popularity, proving the viability of Dan&#8217;s business model and as a result, podcast producers began following Dan&#8217;s lead. Today the podcasting industry is not the same as it was two years ago. <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a>, <a href="www.70decibels.com">70 Decibels</a>, and <a href="http://muleradio.net">The Mule Radio Syndicate</a> are all established broadcasting brands. The defining traits that made The Talk Show so popular&#160;&#8212;&#160;exceptional audio quality as compared to other podcasts of the day, the chemistry Dan and John had, and the format of the show&#160;&#8212;&#160;are now expected throughout the industry. In other words, The Talk Show is no longer a novelty. As such although the move to the Syndicate undoubtedly thrust Mike&#8217;s network into the spotlight, the move did not and will not result in the level of success The Talk Show on 5by5 did.</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s history with 5by5 is an interesting one. From the aforementioned Quora post: &#8220;Mike originally had a show on 5by5 before he moved that show to his own network. Mike actually paid Dan to have that show on 5by5. I believe the figure was $1000 a month. It was advertising for Mike. He paid Dan and got tons of earballs. Then when the show got some traction, he left 5by5 and started Mule. Very slick move. Devious, but slick.&#8221; This was indeed a very shrewd business move that deserves either criticism or praise. In a perfect world, Mike would have started Let&#8217;s Make Mistakes on 5by5 and rather than leave the network once his podcast became popular, stay with 5by5 <em>because</em> it made his show popular, and in doing so he could give something back to the source of his success. However, the arrangement between Mike and Dan seems to have been designed as impermanent from the beginning. In other words, Mike came to 5by5 with the intention of growing successful and then abandoning the network, and Dan was aware of that&#160;&#8212;&#160;and accepted the deal. Now, another 5by5 podcast moving to the Syndicate rubs many people the wrong way. Given that fact, on top of the general dislike of Mike Monteiro and his attitude, I am left to wonder as to whether Gruber considered the possible effects of associating The Talk Show&#8217;s brand with both this figure whom many hold in some level of contempt and this network many see as inferior to 5by5.</p>

<p>This all goes to say that while Gruber&#8217;s move of The Talk Show to The Mule Radio Syndicate will undoubtedly bring with it a certain level of attention, without the profitability and popularity of The Talk Show&#8217;s previous incarnations John Gruber will not be able to reproduce the same results he did for 5by5 throughout the last two years.</p>

<p>To close I would like to address <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/05/40-hours-and-a-mule.html">a particularly chastising article</a> Gabe Weatherhead of Macdrifter posted to his website in response to the multitude of speculatory blog posts and &#8220;personal attacks&#8221; published following the announcement that The Talk Show would change networks. Jonathon Poritsky responded to this article with a post of his own titled <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/05/20/they-write-about-podcasts/">They Write About Podcasts, Don&#8217;t They?</a>. The gist of the argument, from Gabe&#8217;s point of view, is that the listeners of The Talk Show have no business speculating as to the reasons behind the split. He went so far as the say the following in his article: &#8220;How can anyone without personal connections to and personal knowledge of the network switch have any opinion? Further, who gives a shit.&#8221; He continued further in the paragraph: &#8220;I had to resubscribe to a podcast on a different feed. Big deal.&#8221; I believe this final sentence fragment conveys the most profound and telling fact of the entire article: Gabe, despite being a self-proclaimed podcast evangelist, understands little about the medium, and nothing about the people that partake of it. This is a strong statement, so let me begin its explanation with the comment made by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3994456">scheeko</a> on the Hacker News thread following the announcement of The Talk Show&#8217;s move: &#8220;5by5 was the house we visited to listen to John (with Dan) and we show up and he&#8217;s not there...&#8221; The words are tinged with melancholy, an emotion Gabe obviously does not understand, nor does he understand the origins of. In addition to the analogy of a house, many also compared the breakup to a divorce, to which Mike Monteiro had this to say: &#8220;I am concerned at how many of you are comparing someone switching podcast networks to your parents&#8217; divorce. Please please please get help.&#8221; He followed that tweet with another: &#8220;Seriously, the next time one of you leaves AT&#38;T for Verizon I am going to go ballistic and stick my dick in your eye sockets.&#8221; Apparently neither he nor Gabe fully understand the medium: listeners have spent nearly six full days&#160;&#8212;&#160;right around 140 hours&#160;&#8212;&#160;over the past two years listening to The Talk Show since it moved to 5by5. Prior to that, another thirty episodes from the previous incarnation add another couple days. The point is that these listeners have spent an impressive amount of time listening to <em>Dan AND John</em> on The Talk Show; it has become normal&#160;&#8212;&#160;the way it should be. Illogical or not, these listeners expected that the relationship would never change. Now that it has and in such an abrupt manner, they are left confused and lost. That&#8217;s why they needed to write about this. That&#8217;s why some lashed out at Gruber. And that&#8217;s why we speculate.</p>

<p>This is a collection of topics, thoughts, and articles that I found relevant to this article but either did not have enough to say on to devote an entire section to in the main article or could not fit into the main article for one reason or another.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some find it ironic that the following day after announcing that The Talk Show would be leaving 5by5, Gruber posted a link to an article called &#8220;Why Wasn&#8217;t I Consulted?&#8221; The irony stems from the fact that Dan obviously was not consulted regarding this move.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Let&#8217;s examine the 5by5 podcasting business model: Dan approaches a potential co-hosts, pitches that person on a show, and, if all goes well, the pair end up co-hosting what ends up being a popular weekly podcast. Sponsors pay to have ads placed throughout the show, and Dan and his co-host are paid according to the show&#8217;s popularity. Now consider the business model for podcasts which Dan does not co-host such as In Beta, Systematic, and Geek Friday: why are these podcasts, all very popular shows, on the 5by5 network? For shows like Hypercritical, Build &#38; Analyze, Amplified and&#160;&#8212;&#160;until recently&#160;&#8212;&#160;The Talk Show, the answer to that question was because Dan handled the production of the show while his co-hosts brought their talent, expertise, and wit to the table. The result of this matrimony is a popular weekly podcast in every case. Podcast hosts sign with Dan because they either do not have the expertise or the time&#160;&#8212;&#160;or both&#160;&#8212;&#160;to handle the production of a podcast. Merlin Mann is a perfect example of this: while he undoubtedly has the expertise to produce Back to Work given his extensive podcasting background with You Look Nice Today and Roderick on the Line, he co-hosts with Dan because it takes the burden of production from him, and because Dan is a great co-host. Other hosts do not have the same set of motivations, though they may overlap slightly. Gina Trapiani, for example, hosts In Beta with Kevin Purdy. While the two could have probably released their own podcast, it would have been met with much more moderate success than it has been on 5by5, and neither has to worry about production or distribution to boot.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Take the snarky remarks regarding Mike Monteiro and contrast them with the comparison between Dan and John provided by a pscates2.0 on <a href="http://forums.applenova.com/showpost.php?s=ec36dbcc48175c054032b5462ca87a0b&p=753667&postcount=1">a forum post</a> shortly after the announcement that The Talk Show would be leaving 5by5 was released: &#8220;Two very different personalities (Dan&#8217;s affable, &#8221;everyman&#8220; who keeps the show on track, and Gruber&#8217;s caustic, opinionated curmudgeon who never seemed prepared or enthusiastic about the gig).&#8221; Taking a step back from the realm of speculation for a moment, this comment and the multitude of others jumping to praise Dan&#8217;s contributions to the show while criticizing Gruber&#8217;s lack of interest and preparedness lend further credence to the importance of a good host in this medium.</li>

<p>I was first introduced to The Next Web during the plagiarism fiasco from a few months back, which I wrote about in my post from quite a while ago titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>. In that article, I briefly conveyed the lasting impression the whole affair left on my mind regarding The Next Web: &#8220;I have associated The Next Web with plagiarism, rash outbursts, and poor choices.&#8221; As I said in that article, to this day I refuse to read articles on The Next Web.</p>

<p>My first real introduction to The Verge happened a few weeks later, when Josh Topolsky responded to accusations from John Gruber and Marco Arment that The Verge&#8217;s staff was pulling their punches when reviewing products designed nearly identically to that of Apple&#8217;s equivalents. I use &#8220;equivalents&#8221; very loosely here. I had certainly heard of The Verge before then, but that event served as my formal introduction to the site, and also established a general dislike of Josh Topolsky.</p>

<p>Unlike in the case of Josh Topolsky and The Verge, I did not overcome my first impression of The Next Web: to this day I refuse to read any articles posted to the site. Maybe I&#8217;m the one losing here. Maybe I would benefit from reading the articles posted on The Next Web. But we have to draw the line somewhere, and this is where I choose to draw mine.</p>

<p>Every time I hear someone predicting the future of a company&#160;&#8212;&#160;more often than not Apple&#160;&#8212;&#160;I can&#8217;t help but think of a passage I came across a while back, probably in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Economics-Common-Sense-Economy/dp/B0058M6SAG/ref=sr_1_2">Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell</a>. The passage read something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In looking for a correlation between a child&#8217;s ability to read and physical attributes, one could conjecture that as a child&#8217;s shoe size grows, so does that child&#8217;s ability to read. By all measurements, this would be an accurate hypothesis, supported by easily-gathered date available in any middle school around the country. This is indeed a valid trend. But it would not, however, be a valid correlation, as any amount of common sense would reveal: a child&#8217;s ability to read is not, in any way, dependent on their shoe size, even if such a correlation might exist. We must be careful, then, not to draw the wrong conclusions based upon useless correlations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although paraphrased, that passage has stuck in my mind over the years, as many other lessons from that excellent volume have as well. The point, then, is to keep this in mind when writings posts predicting the inevitable demise of Apple or the impending rise of Android based on the price of tea in China or some other useless correlation. In other words, use some common sense; think for yourself for once.</p>

<p>In a footnote to his interesting piece posted yesterday titled <em>Everything Else</em>, John Gruber made an astute observation regarding loyalty and Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Later in his piece, Gassee recommends that Apple engage a &#8216;powerhouse&#8217; PR firm to help sway opinion in its favor. I&#8217;d argue that Apple already has a powerhouse PR firm, and it very successfully engages in most of the tactics Gassee speaks of. But rather than a separate company, it&#8217;s completely internal to &#160;&#8212;&#160; and thus dedicated to &#160;&#8212;&#160; Apple.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason the importance of loyalty is lost on many today, but not Apple: Apple knows the value of loyalty, and that knowledge has certainly served them well over the years.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not, in other words, a matter of faith or belief, but a matter of interest. You train, you run the marathon, and then you take a week off and eat ice cream. Recovered, you start running again. There&#8217;s no mystical hocus-pocus, no &#8216;icy waters of skepticism.&#8217; Our hearts do not &#8216;fail&#8217; when we gaze at our cycling shoes or the box of contractor bags or the stack of over-wintered tomato cages in the unplanted spring garden. We might sigh to ourselves, and we might procrastinate, but we don&#8217;t go in for the Deus Deus Meus shit. At least, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>An interesting opinion on procrastination. It might not be something outside of our control after all. Imagine that.</p>

<p>Every time I think of Roderick on the Line, I can&#8217;t help but recall the episode of Build &#38; Analyze in which Marco Arment announced that he would soon have his first child, and detailed one of his goals regarding Adam: to teach him something just a little bit wrong, something that his son could go through most of his life believing to be true only to find out, in his early twenties, that the thing he had believed his entire life, that one fact his father had continued to push over the years, was just a <em>little</em> bit wrong. I found this absolutely hilarious. And for some reason, this is what comes to mind when I think of Roderick on the Line: it&#8217;s a show about the world that&#8217;s so right in so many ways, but every once in a while just a <em>little</em> bit off.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that everyone reading this go subscribe and download every episode, then spend however long is necessary to listen to every single installment before the next is released. All kidding aside though, Roderick on the Line is one of the best podcasts I have had the privilege of listening to since my introduction to the world of internet broadcasting a few years ago, and one of my favorite podcasts ever.</p>

<p>An interesting article by Marco Arment on the causes and effects of free apps and services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In other industries, this is called predatory pricing, and many forms of it are illegal because they&#8217;re so destructive to healthy businesses and the welfare of an economy. But the tech industry is far less regulated, younger, and faster-moving than most industries. We celebrate our ability to do things that are illegal or economically infeasible in other markets with productive-sounding words like &#8216;disruption&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emin Gun writing on Hacking Distributed about the impending demise of Google Reader and the farcical backlash that ensued following the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Second, I suspect that the Reader-loving hacker-turned-entrepreneur crowd, which is deeply insecure about its position in society, is perhaps so sensitive because they see this as a sign that Google, and by proxy, the computer industry, values the masses with their dirty mobile devices and effervescent Twitter feeds more than the self-titled &#8216;digital cognescenti&#8217; with their MacBooks and Reader accounts and IFTTT recipes that save noteworthy articles in Evernote or whatever. They want to flex their digital muscle. And to some extent, I sympathize with this. But let&#8217;s call a spade a spade, and let&#8217;s pick something more worthy over which to flex our muscle. My greatest fear is what would happen if Google were to go back on their decision. It will feed the crazed, self-important &#8216;technocrati&#8217; so much that we&#8217;ll be deluged with overblown outrage at every perceived online slight. I know how 2 year olds turn out when they get their way with tamper tantrums.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emin made a lot of great points in his article, my favorite of which was his call for all the people whining and complaining about Google&#8217;s announcement to instead focus their collective energies into making or finding a good alternative to Reader. If you can code, write a script to fetch and parse your favorite feeds; such a challenge would be simple and take a few evenings, at best; if not, there are plenty of alternatives out there. Embrace this change, don&#8217;t fight it.</p>

<p>A lack of good ideas and direction caused me to repeatedly forsake the creation of this article, but a persevering determination kept it alive through long hours spent searching for the single salient problem plaguing American education. I came upon the rather anticlimactic answer late one night long after I should have turned the lights out and gone to bed in the most unlikely of places, the one unending source of potential solutions I habitually disregard: myself.</p>

<p>The key to effective education, I came to realize, is not a new system or methodology, though I do believe&#160;&#8212;&#160;as John Roderick said in episode eighteen of Roderick on the Line&#160;&#8212;&#160;this educational construct designed for twenty million people is long overdue for reconsideration in light of the three hundred million individuals we expect it to educate today. While such an approach would likely solve a portion of the problem or maybe even the entire issue, a multi-billion dollar infusion would also have a positive effect on education in America, and require much less effort. Both approaches achieve the desired result without actually addressing the root issue though, and for that reason they should not be championed as the solution to all our problems as the so unfortunately often are. The key to effective education is inspiration at a very young age, and sustained inspiration throughout a child&#8217;s formative years. After all, you can only do so much to make a person proficient in any given area faced with the absence of genuine interest. Just as you can lead a horse to water but cannot make it drink, we can give children the opportunity to learn, but cannot&#160;&#8212;&#160;with good results&#160;&#8212;&#160;actually make them learn the material, as evidenced by the state of education in America today.</p>

<p>Some might go so far as to say that given such a viewpoint, we should leave children to their own devices instead of forcing them to learn certain skills and acquire a certain knowledge base. If their proficiency in those areas is wholly dependent on their level of interest, what&#8217;s the point? To come back to the horse analogy, if you do not lead the horse to water it will die of thirst; if we do not prompt children to learn&#160;&#8212;&#160;if we do not lead them to the water, so to speak&#160;&#8212;&#160;well, we the results might just be the same.</p>

<p>Quite a bit of discussion has taken place over the past forty-eight hours following the news that Google Reader will fade away on June 1st. Some have focused on the implications the announcement will have on the RSS spec, but a great deal&#160;&#8212;&#160;possibly even a majority&#160;&#8212;&#160;of the discussion has taken place around blog readerships. David Sparks&#8217;s article <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/the-rss-apocalypse"><em>The RSS Apocalypse</em></a> and Aldo Cortesi&#8217;s piece <a href="http://corte.si/posts/socialmedia/rip-google-reader.html"><em>Google, destroyer of ecosystems</em></a> stuck out in particular, where the two bloggers conveyed a similar concern: the potential loss of a huge swath of readers either unable or unwilling&#160;&#8212;&#160;or both&#160;&#8212;&#160;to find an alternative method for subscribing to their websites. But as Shawn Blanc said at the end of <a href="http://www.shawnblanc.net/2013/03/goodbye-google-reader/"><em>Goodbye Google Reader</em></a>, &#8220;Only time will tell, and, in truth, those subscribers who don&#8217;t port their feed to another service likely weren&#8217;t all that engaged of readers anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granted we&#8217;re already well into 2013, but then again, this isn&#8217;t much of a list. I don&#8217;t want to see a &#8220;better&#8221; social network usurp Twitter and Facebook, a new laptop with a million pixels, or a bendy phone; I want to see rock solid syncing across all my devices regardless of platform, bundled neatly into an attractive and usable app. Simplenote comes close but, as I detailed in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/drafts-and-reeder.html"><em>Changing my Workflow with Drafts and Reeder</em></a>, is a far cry from even mediocre syncing; similarly, Dropbox is great and absolutely reliable, but requires that I manage individual text files where instead I simply want to create a blank note and walk away secure in the knowledge that regardless of which device I pick up next, it will be everywhere. While Drafts comes close with an excellent cross-platform app and reliable syncing across my iOS devices, there is no desktop counterpart to this wonderful writing experience. As of right now, not a single solution exists to solve this problem, and that&#8217;s quite unfortunate.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-03-15 12:02:30-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-03.html">03</a>/15 12:02:30 EST</time>
<p>Last time I used this title, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/something-to-it.html">I wrote about a more simple lifestyle</a> as part of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn.html">my Cabin</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-patron-saint-of-cabin-porn.html">Porn Binge</a>; this time, I&#8217;m writing about something different: the iPad Mini.</p>

<p>As I packed my iPad and computer in to my backpack early yesterday evening, I had yet to finish <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/reeder-and-drafts.html"><em>Changing my Workflow with Reeder and Drafts</em></a>. With half an hour before dinner and an undetermined amount of time after, I had to make a decision between editing my article on my phone or iPad with what little time I had left at home, and then while out on the road. Vastly superior when it comes to writing especially but editing and proofreading as well, my first inclination told me to bring the iPad. After a brief moment of thought, however, as I wrapped my computer cord up and pushed it into the bottom of my backpack, I decided to use it for now, but to pick up wherever I left off on my phone after leaving the house. By no means an uncommon decision to make, I often choose not to use my iPad with its &#8220;fancy&#8221; Kensington keyboard case in public not because I fear it would get stollen or because I&#8217;m afraid it would get damaged, but because I don&#8217;t want to be <em>that</em> guy standing there typing away at his iPad in its special case, oblivious to the world, saying but not saying at the same time, &#8220;LOOK AT ME, I HAVE AN IPAD AND I DO THINGS ON IT! Hiii, can I axe you a quest&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8221; well, except the last part. But I&#8217;m sure you can understand what I mean: as an eighteen year old high school student, I feel as if every time I use this gaudy piece of engineering brilliance, I make some sort of implied statement about status or something of the sort when in reality my iPad was not something I didn&#8217;t have to work for, a gift or present my parents bought me, but a device I spent an entire summer working for.</p>

<p>I realize that I am over thinking this, but to some much lesser degree I believe it to be very true and all too real. Maybe because I was brought up in a house where it was considered disrespectful to glue yourself to a device around other people, maybe because of something else. The fact remains, though, that I am often uncomfortable using my iPad in public.</p>

<p>After mulling over this realization for several moments, the iPad Mini sprang in to my mind as if to say, &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; The discussion of the iPad Mini&#8217;s usefulness is by now long since done and over with, but for this post I&#8217;m dragging it back out for a few more rounds before pretending to put it away until I find another reason to discuss it once more. Given that I had previously considered the iPad Mini an interesting product only insofar as a low-end iPad, I was surprised to find myself increasingly convinced of its usefulness in such a situation as this one, where I would&#160;&#8212;&#160;presumably&#160;&#8212;&#160;feel much more comfortable pulling out a device much closer to the size of my phone than a small computer. Maybe there is, after all, something to this iPad Mini. Who would&#8217;ve guessed.</p>

<p>I have wanted to overhaul my workflow for a long while now. Feedler Pro, my go-to RSS reader, has gone quite some time without a significant update and is beginning to show its age. Just last night, for example, I spent nearly ten minutes wrestling with it in an attempt at reading a batch of articles curiously marked as read for no apparent reason. Simplenote&#8217;s syncing idiosyncrasies have also become harder and harder to ignore as well, an issue that came to a head this morning when nearly a hundred deleted notes reappeared in the desktop client. Neither a new occurrence nor an especially irregular one, curious hiccups such as this one are one of the few things I can actually depend on Simplenote&#8217;s wholly inconsistent syncing platform for. These two mishaps joined forces with <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">Google&#8217;s recent announcement putting a finite lifespan on the industry&#8217;s most popular feed reader</a> to create the perfect storm, finally prompting me to look in to some alternatives.</p>

<p>The announcement of Google Reader&#8217;s impending demise set the internet in a tizzy last night and throughout today as <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/03/billlllllllions/">post</a> <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/goodbye-google-reader/">after</a> <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/13/google-reader-sunset">post</a> went live analyzing the decision and predicting the effects it will have on the industry and the RSS spec in particular. More than anything else though, the discussion has focused on alternative apps and services. Just this morning I plowed through articles on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101534/feedly-clones-google-reader-api">Feedly</a>, Fever, <a href="http://feedwrangler.net/">Feed Wrangler</a>, an interesting proposition by Daniel Jalkut dubbed <a href="http://www.bitsplitting.org/2013/03/13/netnewswire-cloud/">NetNewsWire Cloud</a>, and many others from my Instapaper queue, most of which on products I had never heard of before. Armed with the knowledge gained in the aforementioned articles and many others besides, and after a fair bit of consideration, I ended up downloading Feedly based on the good things I had read about the app on <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/14/transitioning-from-google-reader-to-feedly/">The Loop</a>, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/goodbye-google-reader/">Shawn Blanc&#8217;s personal blog</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101534/feedly-clones-google-reader-api">The Verge</a>. Without the ability to sort articles as I prefer to read them though, along with a relatively confusing&#160;&#8212;&#160;although visually impressive&#160;&#8212;&#160;interface and sluggish performance on my iPhone 4, Feedly fell short of my needs. In the end I opted to go with Reeder, of which I had also heard many great things about. Like Feedly and a number of the other alternatives I considered before making my decision, Reeder does not use Google Reader as a syncing backend. Taken in tandem with Reeder&#8217;s clean, modern, and intuitive interface and comprehensive control panel, the choice was an easy one to make, and one that I am very satisfied with. The multitude of other bells and whistles&#160;&#8212;&#160;extremely useful caching for offline reading and impressive integration of third-party apps and services, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;are all just icing on a perfect cake.</p>

<p>With a new RSS reader in place, I set about replacing Simplenote. Although I have used Simplenote for quite some time, its syncing backend has proved deplorably unreliable. Unlike my search for a new feed reader, where I went in blind and relied on the opinions of others to point me in the right direction, I already had an app in mind: Drafts. Initially brought to my attention on episode #105 of Back to Work, <a href="http://www.5by5.tv/b2w/105">Fissures of Men</a>, Drafts implements every feature Simplenote possess, and more. This afternoon I purchased Drafts for both my iPhone and my iPad, and let me tell you, as a writer having tried more apps on both the iPhone and iPad than I care to remember, writing in Drafts&#160;&#8212;&#160;regardless of the device&#160;&#8212;&#160;is a joy; I would recommend this app to anyone desiring an excellent cross-platform writing experience for everything from a simple note to a novel. Robust performance, extreme customizability, deep integration with all my favorite apps and more besides, and aesthetically pleasing, Drafts ranks at the top of all iOS text editors I have every come across.</p>

<p>As far as my computer goes, I continue to use Sublime Text as my one and only text editor, First Crack to publish this site, and have no plans to change that any time soon. But who knows, a month ago I would have called Simplenote the best writing app on iOS, and look how that has changed.</p>

<p>// This is not a post about Google Reader: too many people have already shared more than enough opinions on the announcement; I have nothing interesting nor new to say on the topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our shows deserve a solid platform to continue to grow. In my mind, there is no better place for this than 5by5 and no better person than Dan Benjamin to help us continue moving forward. When he first reached out to gauge our interest in joining his network, I was floored. As I said, Dan is a hero of mine, and I was honoured to have our network considered to join 5by5. As we continued to talk, and as I spoke with the other hosts, it was clear that this was the right opportunity for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the news first appeared in my Twitter feed last night I did a double take, positive that I had misread the announcement. Upon further speculation though, and to my growing excitement as I began catching up on the news, 70Decibels and Myke Hurley are indeed moving to 5by5 with the express goal of creating even more great podcasts. Best news ever? I think so.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-03-14 12:43:55-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-03.html">03</a>/14 12:43:55 EST</time>
<p>After publishing my last article, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/soylent.html"><em>Soylent</em></a>, and as I made a late-night snack of a pear, I couldn&#8217;t help but continue thinking about Soylent. Rather than tacking these additional thoughts on to the bottom of the previous post with the sad excuse for poor journalistic planning that is the &#8220;UPDATE:&#8221; header though, I decided to shape them into an entirely separate post, a new post with a few more of my thoughts on Soylent.</p>

<p>From the short amount of time I spent perusing the Hacker News comment thread for this story, I encountered a great deal of skepticism and an inordinate amount of hostility directed towards Rob, his fascinating findings, and his impressive creation interestingly named Soylent. As all the armchair nutritionists, biologists, and general know-it-alls prepared their strongly-worded monologues though, I wonder how many took a step back and examined the success Rob has experienced: not only has his physical health improved over the past thirty days or thereabouts, but his mental health has greatly improved as well: he went from running less than a mile to seven in just four weeks, a very difficult transition that must be attributed to something, and Soylent is simultaneously the most likely and only culprit; psychologically, Rob&#8217;s capacity to focus, absorb, and retain information has also increased, a transformation that, again, must be attributed to Soylent.</p>

<p>And it all makes sense. We go through our lives adhering to one diet or another, carefully monitoring and proportioning our foods in a vain attempt at becoming healthier human beings. When in truth we should look to a diet that tells us to eat everything not for the sake of doing so but because our bodies&#8217; needs often exceed the restrictions placed upon us by the latest fad in dieting, we instead relegate ourselves to eating only certain foods in carefully controlled quantities and only at certain times. It&#8217;s asinine and nonsensical, but it is the only way that we have been able to provide ourselves with the semblance of a complete diet. Until now, that is: Soylent provides every chemical necessitated by the body, and has the potential to provide even more in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic">nootropics</a>. It would not be an extreme stretch to characterize this creation as the perfect diet, as I am sure some already have. Unlike conventional diets though, Soylent appears worthy of such a title.</p>

<p>Providing our bodies with every chemical it could possibly need at each and every meal is not the only benefit to Soylent though, nor is it even the most compelling reason to adopt the diet: the real power behind Soylent is the exacting control it would enable us to possess over our diets. A deficiency of iron, for example, would be easily combated by increasing the amount of iron in your Soylent mixture. Thinking of hitting the gym more often? You will want to add more carbohydrates and protein to your Soylent mixture, plus a few more ingredients I haven&#8217;t thought of off the top of my head. No more power shakes, protein supplements, or ridiculous cravings, Soylent solves all these problems. The benefits of a carefully controlled diet, one in which any sort of deficiency can easily be remedied with the addition or removal of a given ingredient, are enormous; overstating them would be impossible both for healthy and sick individuals alike, as well as those requiring special diets.</p>

<p>As a last-ditch, final effort to convince the skeptics who have managed to make it this far in to this article, consider Soylent in this light: protein shakes are often used by those who frequent the gym as a way to combat a deficiency of protein, among other things, in their bodies as a result of working out. Protein shakes allow their bodies to operate with the appropriate amount of protein, and as a result of which they see accordingly excellent results. Soylent is to the entire body what protein shakes are to those deficient in protein: the solution to the body&#8217;s craving for each and every vitamin, mineral, and substance it is deficient in, allowing it to preform to its greatest potential.</p>

<p>Finally, the convenience of this approach, like the enormous advantages of a finely-tuned diet, cannot be overstated. Imagine a scenario in which your food bill was cut nearly in half along with your utility bill, and you suddenly had a significant amount of previously occupied time to do whatever you wished with. That is the scenario Soylent offers, one in which rather than requiring a significant amount of time, energy, and money as most conventional diets do in order to become a healthier human being, Soylent will not only give you all that back without any of the usual downsides to fast food, but also do so much more efficiently and to much greater results. Once proven, or even before then if you opt-in to experiment with the mixture during the testing phase, I can see no reason not to embrace Soylent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hacking the body is high risk, high reward. I read a textbook on physiological chemistry and took to the internet to see if I could find every known essential nutrient. My kitchen soon looked like a chemistry lab and I had every unknown substance in a glass in front of me. I was a little worried it was going to kill me, but decided it was for science and quickly downed the whole thing. To my surprise, it was quite tasty and I felt very energetic. For 30 days I avoided food entirely and I monitored the contents of my blood and physical performance. Mental performance is harder to quantify, but I feel much sharper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curious after reading Monica Heisey&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/rob-rhinehart-no-longer-requires-food"><em>This Man Thinks He Never Has to Eat Again</em></a>, from which I took the excerpt above, I headed over to Rob Rhinehart&#8217;s personal blog <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/">Mostly Harmless</a> looking for some more information on Soylent. What I found in <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298"><em>How I Stopped Eating Food</em></a> and the follow-up article <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424"><em>What&#8217;s In Soylent</em></a>, in which Rob chronicled the creation and resulting physical and psychological benefits of Soylent, along with the ingredients and reasons for which he chose to include them, respectively, fascinated me. I look forward to hearing a lot more from Rob in the near future: Soylent is an extremely novel and promising idea, and one that has the potential to not only revolutionize our lives, but the world as well.</p>

<p>Although initially intending to make this short observation at the tail end of my previous post, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/critic-markup.html"><em>Critic Markup</em></a>, I ended up spending much more time discussing the new and interesting spec than I had originally planned. The second topic of Ben&#8217;s post, where he pointed to an interview on <a href="http://thedistraction.net/episode-12-ben-brooks-of-5by5-and-brooks-review/">episode twelve of The Distraction podcast</a>, sent me down an all-too-familiar rabbit hole, at the end of which I had subscribed to two new podcasts: <a href="http://thedistraction.net/">The Distraction</a> and <a href="http://castroller.com/podcasts/HundredDown">Hundred Down</a>. The greatest problem we face today, at least on the internet, is an embarrassment of riches: we have too much good content vying for our attention. Not only in podcasts&#160;&#8212;&#160;I am currently subscribed to nineteen podcasts, plus an additional seven parked subscriptions&#160;&#8212;&#160;but in every other form of content on the internet: with the advent of The Magazine and other similar publications, an increasing number of excellent writers making their way on to the internet, and new avenues opening every single day, it becomes increasingly difficult to decide what to pay attention to. That skill, I feel, is what will set the great writers apart from the rest in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>Last month, when Ben Brooks <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/tired-ben/">decided to take</a> a short <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/mine/">sabbatical</a>, he enlisted the help of <a href="http://patdryburgh.com/">Pat Dryburgh</a> who graciously agreed to <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/empty/">step in and keep the site going</a> during Ben&#8217;s absence. When Ben came back, he posted <a href="http://criticmarkup.com/"><em>While I Was Out</em></a>, a short piece covering a few interesting things that had happened during his break.</p>

<p>Ben spent some time discussing the advent of <a href="http://criticmarkup.com/">Critic Markup</a>. Positioned as a complement to Markdown, Critic Markup fills gap in my Markdown use case: commenting. I prefer to write everything, from emails to entire school papers, in Markdown; however, lacking the ability to comment effectively has left me high and dry more than a few times since I adopted Markdown as my go-to syntax for everything under the sun. Critic Markup solves this problem for me; however, Ben nevertheless had some doubts as to the practicality of this product:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Unlike Markdown, though, I fear you really need to use the integrated toolkits (TextExpander, Keyboard Maestro) to get the most of the language as you are having to add more syntax than you do with Markdown. I&#8217;ll report on this more as I dive into it, but I am a bit skeptical about ease of adoption here.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Critic Markup is a novel idea from which many parallels can be drawn to Markdown. At first, Markdown existed solely as an easy to write, easy to use markup language for plain text. Created to streamline the process of writing on the internet, Markdown accomplished that job to sensational results. It did not <a href="http://dillinger.io/">transform text</a> as <a href="http://markable.in/">you type</a>, it was not integrated in every text editor ever made, and it overcame those and other &#8220;shortcomings&#8221;. Like Markdown, Critic Markup was created to cleanly and efficiently solve a single problem: the inability to easily create and manage editorial comments in a Markdown document. Like Markdown in its early days, it will be quite some time before we see widespread platform adoption of the Critic Markup spec, but that does not mean its well thought-out implementation will be any less useful without those neat management features demonstrated on the Critic Markup homepage or at least until those additional features become widely implemented. It&#8217;s not the bells and whistles that make Markdown useful, nor will it be the extra bells and whistles that make Critic Markup useful; Markdown is useful as a finely-crafted syntax, just as Critic Markup will be in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Opened in private beta last year, Submit lets creators upload comics for approval. From there, Comixology reviews work to make sure it &#8221;maintains a level of professional content,"&#8220; then adds it to the catalog. Besides getting a storefront, authors will have their work formatted for Comixology&#8217;s mobile apps, with a panel-by-panel view that&#8217;s proved useful on small screens. In return, they&#8217;ll give up a hefty chunk of revenue: there&#8217;s no up-front fee, but Comixology keeps half the money from each sale after other processing fees, and like other in-app purchases, sales through the iOS app will see Apple take its own cut.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will be interesting to see how the advent of this and other similar systems facilitating an even more streamlined publication process changes the content creation scene in the next few years. An exciting time, to be sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure the advent of Blogger, WordPress, and the likes also ushered in an era in which we have been bombarded with substandard writers filling up the Internet with pages of crap. But such software also allowed some great writers to emerge, and some of them have launched careers and created decent businesses because of it. People and publications like John Gruber&#8217;s Daring Fireball, Jason Calacanis&#8217; Weblogs, TechCrunch, Daily Kos, and Glenn Greenwald all fall into this camp, and that&#8217;s just to name a tiny few. All of them invested immense time, money, and energy into editorial - and they also happen to be compelling writers - but they couldn&#8217;t have done it without the blogging software.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have to side with Marco on this issue: no one reads Daring Fireball because the site sports an off-blue background color and small white text, people read Daring Fireball because John Gruber writes there. That&#8217;s not to discount the importance of good design, but rather that it is not of paramount importance: millions would still read Daring Fireball every month had John colored the background orange, The Magazine would still be a success if the menus were green, and just because your background is off-blue and your text is white certainly does not mean your site will be successful.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-03-12 11:58:49-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-03.html">03</a>/12 11:58:49 EST</time>
<p>A few weeks ago I put the finishing touches on <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-crying-shame.html"><em>A Crying Shame</em></a>. Rather than posting the article here though I submitted it to Marco Arment&#8217;s The Magazine for consideration in a future issue, hoping to one day open the app and find my own words alongside the work of those I hold in high esteem. Within a few days I received a brief response from The Magazine&#8217;s executive editor Glenn Fleishman requesting more information, and I sent him the entire piece. Bolstered by his apparent interest my confidence ran high during the ensuing weeks. Unfortunately, it was not to be.</p>

<p>Late last week, as the temperature continued to drop outside my hotel room on a characteristically cold Duluth night, my phone vibrated. Slightly apprehensive, I opened my email to find another brief message. Stripping the obligatory courtesies out, Glenn Fleishman&#8217;s email rejecting my article from The Magazine read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for work that&#8217;s less philosophical and 10,000-foot view and more rooted in narrative: a good beginning, middle, and end with growth along the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>To say I was crushed would be a vast overstatement: the possibility of such a turn of events had always existed in my mind, and the rejection did not come as a particular surprise; to say that I was disappointed, however, would be an understatement. I was not so much disappointed that my piece had been rejected though, but because I expected so much more from The Magazine: I expected to walk away from this experience, regardless of the outcome, inspired to create better content more often; instead, I found a publication imposing the same restrictions my teachers force me to adhere to. This shining example of what I once considered real writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;the important writing, the stuff that actually mattered&#160;&#8212;&#160;had suddenly performed an about-face, turned to me, and shoved the same criteria my English teachers force upon me in my face; and I recoiled violently, disappointed and disgusted.</p>

<p>When I sat down to write this post I began this paragraph with, &#8220;Another beautiful&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;but stopped there, curious at my choice of the word &#8220;beautiful&#8221; to describe this cabin. This cabin, from what I can see of it, is not particularly beautiful, and although one might make the case to classify its surroundings as such, beauty is not the first thing that comes to mind when I look upon this photo taken some misty day on a far away hillside; rather, the word is merely the only way I know how to quantify the image displayed before me, the way I know best to attempt to convey the sentiment I feel when I see this little cabin nestled in the mountains of Vermont, shrouded in mist and surrounded by trees, the happy home of a lucky individual.</p>

<p>I must start this article with a confession I feel embarrassed to make: until quite recently, this issue existed solely in my peripheral vision; I acknowledged its existence, but only as an unfortunate happenstance. While the internet oscillated back and forth on the sinusoidal curve representing the collective outrage of armchair activists everywhere, I deftly scrolled past the occasional article attempting to address the topic in my news feed penned by writers calling for a change I saw no urgent need for. Until quite recently, sexism existed almost completely outside my realm of focus.</p>

<p>I started writing this article after spending a long Saturday volunteering at an inner-city FIRST Lego League tournament. As my long-time coach and mentor put it, &#8220;it&#8217;s important to give back to a program that has given you <em>so</em> much.&#8221; Indeed it is, and so I volunteered as a technical judge. Tasked with judging the various facets of structural design, programming, strategy, and attempting to gauge the level of understanding of basic engineering principles for those teams to which such a question was applicable, my panel was given fifteen short minutes for each of the twelve or so teams within our judging group: ten to review the aforementioned areas, and five to educate and provide constructive feedback.</p>

<p>Of the roughly twelve teams we interviewed throughout the day, approximately three out of four consisted solely of boys, almost all of which had at least eight team members; relatively small all-girl teams constituted the remaining percentage, and we neither judged nor came across any co-ed teams. Loud, obnoxious, and unfocused, these groups of adolescent males often proved <em>insufferable</em>. And while this sweeping generalization did not fit every all-boy team&#160;&#8212;&#160;four delightfully intelligent young boys made up our first team of the day, for example&#160;&#8212;&#160;the pattern repeated consistently enough to spawn a feeling of dread in the backs of our minds when we looked out the window and saw eight or more boys literally bouncing off the walls. This pattern contrasts sharply with our experience judging all-girl teams: very intelligent, calm, collected, articulate, enthusiastic, succinct, and interested, these traits made those small groups of generally less than five girls not only a true delight to work with in technical judging, but across the research project, presentation, and teamwork areas as well, as I came to find out in speaking with the other judges. By the end of the day the three all-girl teams not only occupied the top three spots in the technical bracket, but in every other aspect too. And rightly so; those traits served them well.</p>

<p>On that Saturday night after a long day spent at the tournament and a long car ride home alternating between sleep and forced wakefulness as my head slipped out of its carefully positioned spot and bounced off the cold glass of the car window, I started writing this piece as nothing more than an interesting observation. At the time, I did not intend for this article to become anything more than my tired musings. Then I read Asher Wolf&#8217;s article <a href="http://asherwolf.com/dear-hacker-community-we-need-to-talk/101/"><em>Dear Hacker Community - We Need To Talk.</em></a> in a rare resurgence of free time; then I changed my mind.</p>

<p>Since that late night spent poorly transcribing my thoughts, I have spent a considerable amount of time thinking about this idea, formulating my thoughts on this unbelievably stupid value system that has an unjustifiable tendency to place men over women. I find the pervasiveness of this fallacious belief in the tech community&#160;&#8212;&#160;in the hacker community, as Asher Wolf put it in her aforementioned piece&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially disturbing. In a space where factors such as race, age, and nationality are disproportionally unimportant as compared to the skill set those within it posses, it seems particularly asinine to me that as a society we nevertheless continue to promote men entering this field over women, and foster a community promising the chance of a terrible experience to the few women that persevere, with Asher Wolf&#8217;s experience as a prime example of this unfortunate possibility.</p>

<p>To bring this back to the FLL tournament I volunteered at a number of weeks ago, if a girl of twelve or thirteen acts as or more mature than a boy of fifteen, and that girl possess comparable or even better technical skills than that older boy, how can we possibly justify a stigma dictating that the boy should receive encouragement and more better opportunities to pursue a technical career than the girl, who may even find herself discourage from walking down a similar path? How can any such argument stand against the obviously disproportionate display of potential on behalf of the younger girl as compared to the older boy, or between two children of opposite genders and of the same age for that matter? Therein lies the question we as a community need to answer. We must answer this question before anything else and upon coming to a conclusion lead by example, an example for the rest of the world to follow. As thought leaders and the creators of the technologies that will grow to shape the future, we are uniquely positioned to propel those brilliant young minds, both male and female, from the FIRST Lego League tournament I attended weeks ago on a level playing field, providing each with an equal opportunity to achieve greatness. We have a responsibility to condemn the experience of those like Asher Wolf, and a duty to ensure that it never happens again, for doing anything else would be naught but a crying shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t start with any wireframes. We didn&#8217;t spend anytime in brainstorming meetings. I gathered an understanding of the general goals, and went to work throwing my initial thoughts into a fake product. The end result was a prototype that, in a lot of ways, was functional.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as writers do, designers often get caught up in minor details and the implementation of processes rather than creating a final product. Whether that sticking point is a brand new text editor or a distraction-free writing environment, a wireframe or finding the perfect hue to contrast just so with another color, it is important to put these potential time sinks in perspective: while they certainly are important, we &#8220;need to concentrate on the things that the reader will notice&#8221;, to <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/cms-war/">quote Ben Brooks</a>, rather than the details we get caught up in all too often, the details that prevent makers from making things.</p>

<p>&#8220;As someone whose memory of perceived past technological betrayals and injustices is so keen that I still find myself unwilling to have a Microsoft game console in the house, my lack of anxiety about this move may seem incongruous, even hypocritical. I am open to the possibility that I&#8217;ll be proven wrong in time, but here&#8217;s how I see it today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A typeface&#8217;s readability is about far more than just one cosmetic attribute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind next time you design a website with Arial or Helvetica. You don&#8217;t even have to buy a font from TypeKit: go to Google Web Fonts and pick something suitable from there&#160;&#8212;&#160;anything to make your site more readable and set yourself apart from everyone else is an excellent choice. Remember, though, that the first job a font should be employed to do is make readable content; it should not be employed to take over the job of your design, but rather serve as a complement to a superb design.</p>

<p>John Gruber in an exceptional article posted to Daring Fireball a few days ago.

<p>&#8220;The Magazine isn&#8217;t successful because I have red links, centered sans-serif headlines, footnote popovers, link previews, and a white table-of-contents sidebar that slides over the article from the left with a big shadow even on iPhone. It isn&#8217;t successful because authors write in Markdown, the CMS gracefully supports multi-user editing, we preview issues right on our devices as we assemble them, and any edits we make after publication are quickly and quietly patched into the issue right as people are reading it. Very little of this matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an all-too-common belief these days, the idea that creating a website mimicking both the design and posting strategy of those bloggers we hold in high regard can somehow catapult us to a similar level of success. But as Marco goes on to say in the aforementioned blog post, design and presentation exist on the outside of a system in which content is the key that unlocks both loyal readership and phenomenal success.</p>

<p>In my last post simply titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/outbox.html"><em>Outbox</em></a> I linked to an article by Laura June of The Verge in which she raised a number of doubts as to the practicality of Outbox, including the potential legal troubles the startup could run into given that opening its users&#8217;s mail is an integral part of the startup&#8217;s business model. I glossed over those concerns in my last post; however, I feel they do merit some discussion.</p>

<p>The thesis I kept returning to over lunch was grounded in free-market economics and flavored with a hint of <a href="http://www.verifiedfacts.org/">conspiracy</a>: of any organization dealing with sensitive information, Outbox, as a public company, would have a particular interest in preserving its users&#8217;s privacy or risk numerous costly and eventually crippling lawsuits. Even setting that very likely possibility aside though, what guarantee do we have now that the Post Office clerk or the mail room worker is not carefully slicing open our letters, reading the contents, and them resealing it? In truth, absolutely none; and for that reason I found it particularly asinine for someone to discount this startup by proposing a potential problem plausible in today&#8217;s postal service.</p>

<p>&#8220;For $4.99 a month, you sign up online for an Outbox account (they also have apps), and then an Outbox employee comes to your house, picks up your mail, takes it back to Outbox HQ, opens it, scans it, and gives you access to it via your account. From there, you can &#8221;unsubscribe&#8220; from junk mail, and request to have your mail &#8221;delivered&#8220; to your house (even though it was definitely already delivered once, the other day).&#8221;</p>

<p>After reading Laura June&#8217;s article on the new startup Outbox posted to The Verge earlier this week, I feel that she missed the point: Outbox is not supposed to catalyze the process of bringing mail to your home, but instead offer real-life spam filtering and digitization in exchange for the addition of a day or two between sender and recipient. And that&#8217;s a tradeoff I&#8217;m sure many people, myself included, would be comfortable making.</p>

<p>Ah the linkblog. Although <a href="https://twitter.com/hypercritical/status/294115979150098432">not the genesis of the format</a>, John Gruber is often credited with the advent of this extremely pervasive practice and its widespread adoption over the years, a propagation that has continued despite the resurgence of its detractors every few months. Nevertheless, in spite of those dissidents, many writers have built a business around this model. Today, I would like to focus on one in particular: Shawn Blanc.</p>

<p>Every time I see an article from Shawn Blanc scroll into view in my feed reader, I stop and open it because, more often than not, it is an actual article as opposed to a linked list post discussing whatever tired topic has already been dragged across every other blog I read. Contrast that with The Loop and Daring Fireball where I merely read the article headline, seldom even opening the full text in my RSS reader much less actually navigating to either site. I find it unlikely that this habit is unique to me, and thus is something new bloggers attempting to determine their posting strategy should keep in mind, as should veteran writers as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Members contribute nearly half of this site&#8217;s income. Which means there is no way I could be writing here as my full-time gig without the generous support of the members.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a month left in Shawn Blanc&#8217;s membership drive he announced an additional incentive to the existing membership perks: prizes. Worth an aggregate of more than $3,000, these prizes are a great way to encourage readers on the fence about whether to become a member or not and an interesting take on the increasingly popular practice of individual bloggers cultivating a strong readership through member programs. Here&#8217;s to hoping Shawn not only reaches his goal, but exceeds it as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We paid for these goddamn seats, and we&#8217;ll recline them if we want to.&#8217; So then everyone was angry: I was angry because I had no room, and she was angry because I passive-aggressively kicked her seat once every 15 minutes&#160;&#8212;&#160;often enough to be annoying, but not often enough to definitely be on purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Funny how such a little thing could become such a bone of contention to so many people. Having spent days in airports and on numerous long flights though, I can certainly see where Dan Kois is coming from: there are few things more annoying during a flight than having what little personal space you are allotted cut down to a fraction by the person in front of you.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I fill the last jar with sweet summer pears I ponder for a second. Why do all this work when I could buy it? Well the truth is I don&#8217;t like money. I&#8217;m not good with it.

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-start-a-magazine.html">Speaking of Marco Arment</a>, yesterday he posted an article called <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/02/21/the-first-read-later-service"><em>The first &#8220;Read Later&#8221; service</em></a> in which he discussed the origins of Instapaper and the service that was eventually rebranded as Pocket:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Months after Instapaper launched all of these features and was being very well-received in the tech press, in October 2008, Read It Later added a web service for sync, other-browser bookmarklets, and offline saving. Then an iPhone app in 2009. And while Read It Later has introduced some original features, Weiner systematically copied almost every major Instapaper feature over the first few years of Instapaper&#8217;s existence.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco also linked to a few other pieces in his aforementioned article: <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/11/16/readability"><em>The Relationship between Readability and Instapaper</em></a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/09/16/some-other-tablets-you-may-have-seen"><em>Some other tablets you may have seen</em></a>. The following excerpt is from the latter of the two, explaining a part of his reasoning behind writing <em>The first &#8220;Read Later&#8221; service</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This awkward avoidance betrays a lack of confidence in their innovation and an internal culture of severe denial &#160;&#8212;&#160; two deep-rooted traits that Microsoft is famous for. So when the Microsoft people speak like this, it&#8217;s not serving them well: to everyone outside of Microsoft, it&#8217;s painfully obvious that they&#8217;re either delusional or trying very poorly to bullshit us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Marco: the story behind Instapaper and its competitors needs to be told; and for those spreading lies, saying that Readability was the first app of its type on the market, this is unacceptable. Did I say Readability? I meant Clearly&#160;&#8212;&#160;wait, no, Pocket; excuse my confusion.</p>

<p>Marco Arment gave Jacob Goldstein of NPR some concrete numbers for the Magazine, showing just how great an idea launching this publication was, the importance of a consistent publication schedule, and the rewards of such an excellent implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Last fall, Marco Arment launched a general interest magazine. It&#8217;s called, aptly enough, The Magazine. Writers are paid $800 per article. There are no ads. Until recently, it was available only via iPhones and iPads. Astonishingly, it&#8217;s already turning a profit.&#8221;</p>

<p>With years of programming under my belt and currently taking a philosophy course, I found the parallels a blogger writing under the moniker &#8220;panefsky&#8221; drew between programming, philosophy, and specific philosophers interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is perfectly reasonable to consider the programming languages as the different philosophies of a virtual world, in which entities do exist and interact with each other. To this respect, even the fundamental philosophical questions receive an interesting transformation: For example &#8216;What is self-conscience?&#8217; can be rephrased as &#8216;What is reflection?&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are at the very beginning of the build process,&#8217; Dave Bedwood, creative partner at Lean Mean Fighting Machine, said in an email. &#8216;This site is very much for people to sign up now, get a second twitter account, private to them, and just watch it learn and grow. As A.I advances, then maybe we will then get into it being able to copy syntax. When you die, if you&#8217;ve had this account for a long time, it may be able to keep tweeting as you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Although skeptical at first, the more I thought about it&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially in light of the impressive learning capabilities of the <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/quadracopters.html">quadracopters previously linked to</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;the more I became convinced that this step in artificial intelligence was not only possible, but something we will likely see in the coming years.

<p>When I scrolled past this article on Hacker News late last night, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect. I certainly wasn&#8217;t expecting to see remote control quadracopters (flying vehicles with four rotors instead of one as in a helicopter) balancing, throwing, and catching a large pendulum with practiced precision. To my amazement though, that&#8217;s exactly what I found, along with another video showing <a href="http://youtu.be/3CR5y8qZf0Y">two similar quadracopters juggling a ball back and forth</a> with near-unbelievable success. Merely classifying these demonstrations as absolutely amazing falls far short of the impressive work conducted by Dario Brescianini, Markus Hehn, Raffaello D&#8217;Andrea, and the author of the original article Markus Waibel at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, but it will have to suffice.</p>

<p>Kenneth Erikson tells his amazing life story in an article titled <em>I&#8217;m a shut-in. This is my story</em>. No matter what I try I can&#8217;t quite capture the essence of this intensely personal piece, so I will leave you with this excerpt and the strongest urging possible to set aside a good hour to read K-2052&#8217;s amazing story from beginning to end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re fake for long enough you&#8217;ll eventually start to fake yourself. The same tricks you pull on others you&#8217;ll start to pull on yourself. And trust me, there is no better person at deceiving you than you. You know all the right things to say to make you feel good. You know all the buttons to push. You know all the quotes, phrases, logic, rationalizations and flashes of epiphany that you&#8217;ll swallow hook line and sinker. You&#8217;re your most deceptive foe. You could sell yourself invisible snake oil from an imaginary salesmen in an invisible desert and then congratulate yourself on your luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite some time ago I came across Jeffrey Way&#8217;s article <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/editorials/publishers-dont-restrict-writers/"><em>Publishers: Don&#8217;t Restrict Writers</em></a> and added it to my Instapaper queue more out of curiosity at an article posted on Nettuts+ not about programming than anything else. Nearly a month prior, I had read an article on Ben Brooks&#8217; website called <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/11/self-publishing/"><em>Self-Publishing</em></a> in which he said something I found very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Writing an iBooks book on my own turned into less about writing and more about layout, software, and editing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben went on to say that as a result of this unnecessarily complex process&#160;&#8212;&#160;a process Jeffrey outlines and talks about in his aforementioned article&#160;&#8212;&#160;he had decided not to write the book. In a similar vein Jeffrey discussed the effects placing artificial restrictions on writers often causes, concluding that stipulating such harsh requirements often prompts writers to refuse projects at their onset or leads to its eventual abandonment as the absurdity of such rules becomes apparent. Restrictions constrain ideas to a pre-determined idea of what is acceptable; in a space as innovative as writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially on the internet&#160;&#8212;&#160;it is not only impractical to force writers to operate within ridiculous constraints, but also non-conducive to the great content we as a society and the internet community in particular hold so high.</p>

<p>Yesterday marks the tenth day since I last made a post to this site, the tenth day spent doing other things besides reading and writing in every free moment of my day; today marks the eleventh day since that last post went live, and the day I have decided to return to that lifestyle.</p>

<p>Last week was unusually busy as compared to the previous six weeks, and unfortunately sitting down to write at midnight and wedging an article in whenever I had a spare moment was one of the first things to go. As my schedule filled&#160;&#8212;&#160;or as those few things occupying my calendar expanded to demand more time, as is more accurate&#160;&#8212;&#160;writing got pushed further and further down the stack until I not only ceased writing, but everything I associate with it as well: I stopped listening to podcasts; my Instapaper queue, finally emptied early this month, filled once again; I barely managed to check Hacker News once a day, if even that; and I went days without opening my feed reader or Twitter, which I use in a very similar way. I was busy; writing had ceased to be a priority in my life.</p>

<p>The important lesson buried within this anecdote resides in my attitude towards this hiatus and the manner through which I have attempted to enter back in to the habit of writing after spending ten days doing anything but: throughout my short leave I occasionally felt some degree of disappointment in myself that I was not writing, but I was careful not to let that feeling become overly powerful or taint my sentiment towards this craft. Rather than feel guilty that I had not written anything for another day I took it in stride, confident in the knowledge that when the time came, I would sit back down to write once more. This decision allowed me to push my computer towards the back of my desk earlier this afternoon, prop my iPad open, and begin to write this article. There was nothing special about my approach: no magical thinking, no ritualistic preparations; there was no hesitation in my mind, no feelings of doubt in my ability; there was only a writer sitting down to write once again. That, and nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a young man I discovered that most people are insecure and full of shit. They are balloons of crap on the verge of bursting. The slightest pin-prick can destroy their self image and cover everyone else in their filth. I discovered that &#8216;normal&#8217; is a lie. A teenage boy that can&#8217;t smile is as self conscious as a girl with a bad haircut. I was lucky. When I was 9 I lost control of a motorcycle and crashed. When I was 9 I learned that there&#8217;s no such thing as being normal.&#8221;</p>

<p>After reading this article by Hartley Brody quite some time ago, I set out to build a web scraper designed to analyze Hacker News. And while the project remains unfinished, it is in no way a reflection upon the work that inspired me to undertake it. Hartley Brody talks about ah interesting way to capture data using a web browser and scraping rather than an API in an article well worth the read.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I communicated about concerns and issues - as well as complaints from Cryptoparty participants peeved with out-of-touch crypto-lecturers who wanted to teach command lines to crypto-newcomers - I got put downs, got brushed off, ignored, told &#8216;oh don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll look after it, it won&#8217;t be a problem&#8217;, &#8216;don&#8217;t worry your head about it&#8217;, or aggravatingly - told that I wasn&#8217;t qualified to judge their choices as I wasn&#8217;t a crypto-expert or a hacker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asher Wolf brings to light a darker side of the internet as and the hacker community in particular, chronicling her &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; experience, if you will, with misogyny in the hacker culture. Disgusting&#160;&#8212;&#160;indescribably disgusting; that&#8217;s the thought that overrode all others as I read this piece, and the lesson we need to learn from this article. Absolutely terrible.</p>

<p>From the author of <a href="http://bloglivingthedream.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/so-simple/">so simple</a>, the article I referenced in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/so-simple.html">my last post</a>, speaking to her attempt at achieving a &#8220;simpler, greener, cleaner, freer life&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I still feel very guilty about small habits which I can&#8217;t shake, one of which is my Nespresso coffee machine with its dependency on capsules bought in a store which makes my skin crawl with its ostentatiousness, a cathedral to consumerism.  But today while stocking up my habit, I found out that I can recycle the capsules at the store and the aluminium will be melted down.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I looked back on this short post consisting merely of the two paragraphs above, prepared to save it for publication tomorrow morning, I couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling that it lacked something. There was, ironically, definitely something missing from this post about simplifying one&#8217;s life. And then it came to me: a few weeks ago during my cabin porn binge I posted an article called <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/something-to-it.html"><em>Something to it</em></a>. After spending two days consuming every available resource so much as mentioning cabins or simplified living, I made an observation that maybe there was something to this simple lifestyle after all, something more than a cabin deep within the woods and a less demanding lifestyle&#160;&#8212;&#160;something more than meets the eye. This article from the anonymous writer at Living the Dream rekindled that spark, igniting the curiosity that prompted me to ask the question, &#8220;is there something more to this simplicity?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another blogger writing a response to Rohan Anderson&#8217;s post <a href="http://wholelarderlove.com/hard-at-work-living-simple/"><em>Hard at Work, Living Simple</em></a>, putting in to words the feeling I spent so long attempting to quantify and capture but, ultimately, proved too elusive to voice in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hard-at-work.html">my commentary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There is no manual, no one set way to downsize, seize life, focus on what&#8217;s important.  But geez, when I read Rohan&#8217;s Whole Larder Love blog entry today, I was ready to make him my guru, his website my guide to &#8216;simple living&#8217;.  Read it for yourself.  Just this one post struck me deeply and I cannot explain why.  But I sat at my desk looking out my 6th floor office window reading it on my iPhone at lunch time with tears thickening my eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the wagon lumbered up the street proclaiming the news of Aaron Swartz&#8217;s suicide, I jumped right on. I had never even heard of him, but I nevertheless jumped right on the bandwagon, eager to bemoan the passing of an individual many hailed as nothing short of a prodigy. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/aaron-swartz.html">I eulogized the man</a>, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/lean-into-the-pain.html">praised</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/be-more-productive.html">his</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/who-writes-wikipedia.html">work</a>, and condemned the system that supposedly drove him from this life. Tom Negrino of Backup Brain took a slightly different approach after spending nearly four weeks in embittered silence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fed up with the Aaron Swartz hagiography and subsequent bullshit garment-rending from people who didn&#8217;t know him well, or at all. I&#8217;m still reading fresh examples of anguished wailing and blogging and Twittering about the guy. But to me, he seems unworthy of the sainthood that&#8217;s being thrust onto his corpse.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a topic such as this and words such as Tom&#8217;s, many will likely label him as insensitive and brusque. Think for a minute though, before writing a very strongly-worded tweet from the vantage point granted by your lofty pedestal, that Aaron Swartz might not have been the saintly do-gooder everyone describes him to be or the martyr we seem to be searching for so desperately. Maybe, just maybe, he was a cowardly child afraid of facing the consequences of his actions, someone that through some twisted reasoning though it acceptable to kill himself and allow one of the few people he loved to find his body suspended from the ceiling. Maybe, just maybe, Tom is right.</p>

<p>&#8220;I greatly admire what WordPress did for the web; to say that we want to be the WordPress of forums is not a stretch at all. We&#8217;re also serious about this eventually being a viable open-source business, in the mold of WordPress. And we&#8217;re not the only people who believe in the mission: I&#8217;m proud to announce that we have initial venture capital funding from First Round, Greylock, and SV Angel. We&#8217;re embarking on a five year mission to improve the fabric of the Internet, and we&#8217;re just getting started. Let a million discussions bloom!&#8221;</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-02-05 17:18:27-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-02.html">02</a>/05 17:18:27 EST</time>
<p>&#8220;No one could tell me why I was wasting my creative energy, focus, and life on something I didn&#8217;t want to do. Classes didn&#8217;t hold my attention- I could teach myself more in an afternoon than I would learn in a 10-week class. My classes appealed to the lowest-common denominator. The bottom of the barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the situation Steve Corona describes in his insightful piece <a href="http://stevecorona.com/college-was-my-biggest-mistake/"><em>College was my biggest mistake</em></a> is not exclusive to college, but a never-ending battle waged throughout the lives of countless students across the world regardless of age or location, especially in American. Even as a homeschooler I encounter this difficulty every single day in every one of my classes. Let me say it again in the hopes of reinforcing this crucial point: this situation, the tendency for classes to appeal to the lowest common denominator, as Steve put it, is not exclusive to colleges, but an all-too common experience in today&#8217;s educational construct. And while there is some hope for educational reform, we must ask the question, &#8220;Will it be too late?&#8221; Towards the end of his piece Steve explained that even today fewer companies look at college credentials, instead preferring the real-world experience formalized learning does such a good job of preventing, the real-world experience people like Steve opt for at the expense of the increasingly irrelevant college degree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since my early twenties, I&#8217;ve looked at my older peers and tried to figure out why some stagnate and how others stay vibrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Matt Might goes on to propose that &#8220;comfort breeds technical fossilization&#8221; and thus leads many writers to stagnate as time goes by, I would instead suggest that the blame should go to stagnation itself as both the cause and effect rather than simply the effect of growing comfortable, for through the door propped open by a lack of desire to try new and daring things waltzes stagnation and then ruin, unchecked and uninhibited by the rolling tides of innovation seeking to drown both. Matt Might&#8217;s article <em>12 resolutions for programmers</em> goes on to propose a number of other activities designed to keep those tides rolling, and in doing so perpetuate that all-important desire to create and innovate.</p>

<p>Rohan Anderson of <a href="http://wholelarderlove.com">Whole Larder Love</a> on the pursuit of happiness in a more simple life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Many believe that you&#8217;re supposed to find love, get married, work you butt off, earn money, own stuff, out-do your neighbours and pop out perfect kids. People that believe in this are in fact, idiots. Because that approach is not suited for everyone. From my short life I&#8217;d say life is more about experiences, love, culture, memories, achieving contentedness and if you&#8217;re lucky, very lucky...finding true happiness. The latter of which is THE goal for people these days. But let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s a bit rubbish. You can&#8217;t be happy all the time, not even half the time, but you can be content. And I reckon that&#8217;s something worth aiming for.&#8221;</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-02-05 12:52:11-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-02.html">02</a>/05 12:52:11 EST</time>
<p>Last weekend I found myself at a place I rarely make it to these days: it was early evening, I had cleared my Instapaper queue of articles newer than the last week, and my feed reader&#8217;s article count read, for the moment, zero. I had no articles to read, no back-burner topics clamoring for my attention, and I felt unmotivated to wade through my extensive Instapaper backlog in search of a suitable topic to write about. The situation felt strangely unfamiliar and weird. Shifting back into gear though I alt-tabbed over to my Simplenote client and began scrolling through an amalgam of nearly one hundred and fifty half-baked articles, prompts, and ideas. Before long I stopped on a note titled &#8220;Citational Fallacy&#8221; and began reading.</p>

<p>Written months ago, I expected to rewrite the greater majority of Citational Fallacy, merely preserving the title, general topic, and possibly the gist of the argument contained within. To my surprise, however, I discovered four exceptionally well written paragraphs. Paragraphs so good, in fact, that even today, a week after I first opened Citational Fallacy, I have yet to make a meaningful contribution to the piece. Not for lack of trying, but simply because regardless of how many times I sit down and pound out a paragraph, none of my attempts compare to the original. Rather than beating my head against a wall though, I spent some quality time thinking about this and eventually came upon a realization I find quite intriguing: over the past few months I have become all too accustomed to &#8220;writing with personality&#8221;, and in doing so have let my standards slide. Whereas a few months ago, back when I wrote Citational Fallacy, the thought of using a single be verb or employing even one contraction would not only have been unthinkable but also a mark of shame, today I sit here writing poorly formed articles rife with grievous grammatical and stylistic errors, all in the name of making my writing more engaging by employing &#8220;personality&#8221;. This realization led me to an interesting conclusion and lent me the conviction with which I sat down to write this piece late last night:</p>

<p>The act of &#8220;writing with personality&#8221; merely serves to facilitate subpar work in a vain attempt at excusing the abandonment of all the traits that make for exceptional writing. Primary among these quickly abandoned traits resides the editorial process, cast to the wayside in order to safeguard the whimsical flair masquerading as personality behind which poor writing lies, hidden in the shadows cast by poorly formatted paragraphs, weak sentences, repetitious wording, appalling disregard for even the most basic rules of grammar and style, inconsistency, boring word choices, passive sentence constructions, and abhorrent be verbs.</p>

<p>The line between correctly implementing personality and throwing the rules out the door is a fine one, and one very few writers walk upon. To the one side those who stick to the rules forced upon them over years spent under the tutelage of the education system reside with their dry, five-paragraph essays and MLA works cited pages; on the other exist those incapable of comprehending even the most basic of rules, instead choosing to write by swiping their hands across a keyboard, applying a rudimentary spell checker, and posting the article&#160;&#8212;&#160;if it even deserves the designation&#160;&#8212;&#160;in the preposterous hope of somehow attracting a significant level of attention. Between those two factions, however, a select few sit perched atop the mountain, perpetually teetering at the edge of the abyss, constantly fighting the winds that rock them to and fro towards one form of destruction or another.</p>

<p>I somehow managed to forget to post this article after I wrote it, so here it finally is:</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>A blast from the past in an article written three years ago today, on January 26, 2010, by Josh Bernoff:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We call this new world the Splinternet (with a nod to Doc Searls and Rich Tehrani, who used the term before us with a somewhat different meaning). It will splinter the Web as a unified system. The golden age has lasted 15 years. Like all golden ages, it lasted so long we thought it would last forever. But the end is in sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how the increasingly diverse computing market was viewed even just a few years ago, in a time when accidentally finding this article on my computer and piecing together this post between my phone and iPad would have been impossible.</p>

<p>In the wee hours of this morning Andrew Sullivan and his team completed The Dish&#8217;s migration from The Daily Beast, transitioning fully to a reader-supported model. In an article posted to The Verge a few hours later titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/4/3949834/andrew-sullivan-the-dish-experiment-goes-live"><em>Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s grand experiment in reader-supported online journalism is now live</em></a>, Jeff Blagdon describes the challenges facing The Dish as one of the first major websites to become reader-supported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Prominent political blogger Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s site The Dish is now up and running at its new user-funded home. So far, the ad-free experiment appears to be a success, with Sullivan pulling in $511,000 in revenue over the five weeks that passed since the project was announced &#160;&#8212;&#160; half of the $1 million the writer says he needs to run the site for a year.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeff went on to question the plausibility of The Dish reaching its funding goal in the coming weeks, skeptical of whether or not it was possible. But Andrew has a plan, detailed in The Verge&#8217;s piece <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/2/3827960/andrew-sullivan-dish-blog-leaving-daily-beast-for-reader-subscription-model"><em>Andrew Sullivan leaving The Daily Beast for ad-free, reader-supported blog</em></a> as well as on The Dish&#8217;s own site in <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/02/04/migration-explained/"><em>Migration Explained</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Starting Monday morning, some posts will have a blue &#8216;Read On&#8217; button. If you click that button, the post will expand for continued reading, just as in the past. If you&#8217;re a subscriber, you will always be able to access all read-on material. If you are a non-subscriber, you will be limited to seven read-on clicks during a 30-day period. If you open a read-on post in a new window, that will also count against the read-on meter. If non-subscribers max out the read-on meter, all content above a read-on will still be free and accessible - but the deeper dish won&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Striking the delicate balance between a full-on paywall and leaving their content open for anyone to read, The Dish&#8217;s segregation strategy fills me with hope for other major websites forsaking ads in place of reader contributions in one form or another. He continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Incoming links from other blogs and websites will never, ever count toward the meter; other bloggers need not fear that their readers won&#8217;t be able to see content they link to. I want to personally soothe Dan Savage&#8217;s concern on this point.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I foresee this becoming a problem, I applaud The Dish&#8217;s foresight to create their paywall strategy with bloggers in mind. All in all The Dish has a very interesting plan, one that I hope to see succeed in the coming months.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Jim Dalrymple posted an article to his blog <a href="http://loopinsight.com/">The Loop</a> called &#8220;<a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/02/02/scientists-create-near-living-crystal/">Scientists create near living crystal</a>&#8221;. When the article scrolled into view, I mused as to why a scientist creating something near a living crystal would be of any interest. After all, creating things is part of the scientist&#8217;s job, is it not? Then yesterday afternoon I saw an article titled &#8220;<a href="http://sciencenordic.com/we-should-only-work-25-hours-week-argues-professor">We should only work 25 hours a week, argues professor</a>&#8221; from Science Nordic. Although the first time around I opted not to open it, curiosity got the better of me the second time I scrolled through Hacker News. I opened the page expecting to find a misguided, self-righteous professor of some degree (pun intended) pontificating as to why he felt academics should only work 25 hours a week. What I found, however, was an interesting piece proposing that rather than whiling away our youth working at the expense of spending time with family and friends only to find ourselves with an inordinate amount of free time in our latter years, we should instead work for greater portions of our lifespan in exchange for shorter work weeks.</p>

<p>These short anecdotes have two things in common: the titles to both articles were poorly written. In the case of Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s piece, the title led me to believe a scientist was creating something near a living crystal, when in actuality scientists had created a near-living crystal. Similarly, Science Nordic&#8217;s title implied that professors were claiming that they should work a mere 25 hours a week, not that the collective we should. Thanks to these grammatically-incorrect titles, it was only by chance that I ended up reading either article. Unfortunately, these are not the only culprits: I see this happen almost daily.</p>

<p>Good writing is not only important in the body of an article, but the title as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the most refreshing parts of the show is how humbly John approaches his opinions. It isn&#8217;t about him getting it correct, it is about arriving at the best result possible through collective effort. Nearly half of the show is John discussing follow-up comments he has received about past topics. Sharing his platform with the opinions and comments of others always felt incredibly intellectually honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>I finally got around to David Smith&#8217;s article The Hypercritical Way after hearing about it during Hypercritical&#8217;s final episode, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/100">Metacritical</a>. While the passage quoted above is a good attempt at quantifying one of the many reasons so many people loved Hypercritical so much, you will never find the actual reason written in a paragraph regardless of how many pages that paragraph spans. The compilation of selected excerpts at the end of the article gets closer to defining that feeling, but nevertheless falls short in an act only listening to every single episode will ever accomplish.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s maybe most striking about Tweetping is its presentation of data in pulses and punctuations: boomboomboomboom-PAUSE. That&#8217;s largely an accident of interface, but it also suggests something profound about Twitter and the social web: This stuff has a beat. It has rhythms and rushes and respites. It&#8217;s its own kind of organism, with its own kind of pulses &#160;&#8212;&#160; its own kind of heartbeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first, the <a href="http://tweetping.net/">Tweetping</a> world map is nearly empty. A combination of javascript libraries begin parsing a real time stream of data from the Twitter API though, and the map quickly begins to populate. Within a few minutes, the map becomes a somewhat accurate representation of the world&#8217;s Twitter activity. Although Tweetping has been the recipient of <a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2013/02/tweetping/">some criticism</a> since coming to widespread attention this past weekend, it is nevertheless one of the best Twitter activity visualizations on the internet. This morning, over breakfast, I used it to watch the West Coast wake up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes when the pressure of city living would build to boiling point, I&#8217;d pack up my car and head bush. At times there would be a sense of insecurity, even fear, of the bush. Even though I grew up there, I would still be intimated. Why? Because I&#8217;d become a synthetic human. I&#8217;d spent far too much time at a desk under dull lights staring at a computer. I&#8217;d eat in the tea room, or the cafeteria with the other robots, and I&#8217;d spend hours between 8am - 5pm working on databases and spreadsheets and numerous other useless tasks. So when it came to the breaking point, I&#8217;d pack the camping gear in the car and head bush, I ended up both intimidated and impressed by the bush, as it had become foreign to a certain extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Siricusa on Apple&#8217;s to-do list for the coming year, posted to his personal blog <a href="http://hypercritical.co/">Hypercritical</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t just lead Apple to a record quarterly profit of $13.1 billion on sales of $54.5 billion, so I don&#8217;t expect to be consulted. But were Tim to ask me, here&#8217;s what I would tell him Apple should do in 2013&#160;&#8212;&#160;in broad strokes, and in no particular order.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John&#8217;s third and seventh points, to diversify the iPhone product line and to improve iCloud, respectively, merit some discussion. A few weeks ago I wrote a post called <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-problems-with-icloud.html"><em>The Problems with iCloud</em></a>, in which I talked about Apple&#8217;s latest foray into cloud services and my problems with the product. It would be a huge step forward for Apple to finally offer a cloud service superior to the competition&#160;&#8212;&#160;superior to Dropbox. Underestimating the significance of those move would be a mistake.</p>

<p>And then we have the suggestion to diversify the iPhone product line. I first saw this idea from Marco Arment late last week, and the Internet has been abuzz since then. I am not qualified to speculate as to the probability of these rumors, nor would I even if I did possess the knowledge; my goal in publishing this website is not to become the next John Gruber or Mac Rumors. I will, however, say this: by &#8220;diversify the iPhone product line&#8221;, everyone means to say that Apple should ship a cheaper iPhone. Whether or not Apple chooses to do this, however, is not a matter of feasibility in production or difficulty selling this new, nuance device, but whether Apple wishes to support the low-end market they will capture with a low-end iPhone.</p>

<p>When I sat down to write earlier this evening there were a lot of things on my mind, my mind kept returning to the subject of design, still fresh in my mind after this site&#8217;s redesign last weekend. As much as I like the clean and simple layout I have now, it is not very media-friendly. I made this choice early on in the design process partially because I very rarely desire to post any sort of content other than plain text, but also because I have not found an acceptable way to do so in a manner complementary to my site&#8217;s design. Like <a href="http://the-magazine.org">The Magazine</a> in its early days, therefore my site does not feature anything but simple text. Although for the most part I am fine with that, I would nevertheless prefer to have the ability to post a cool or interesting sound byte, image, or video should the need present itself.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind, I drew an interesting parallel. Marco Arment&#8217;s <a href="http://the-magazine.org/">The Magazine</a>, now in its ninth issue, is known and widely regarded as the superlative publication of its paradigm for three reasons: quality articles, quality design, and quality distribution. If Marco doesn&#8217;t like an article, that article will never ship; he retains complete control of the app&#8217;s design; and as of today, combining each edition&#8217;s size sums to a mere fraction of the hundreds of megabytes required for traditional digital magazines. In other words, Marco Arment controls every aspect of this experience, from distribution to the end user experience, and he uses this control to produce the best digital magazine on the market.</p>

<p>Does this at all sound familiar? We bloggers also control every aspect of every reader&#8217;s experience on our sites: as writers we control the content; as designers, or as the contractor hiring a designer, we have the final say in every design proposition; and as the publisher of our own content, we determine how our products reach our audiences. In other words, we control every aspect of this experience; unlike Marco Arment though, for some reason the vast majority seem to be incapable of realizing this simple fact, continuing to produce poor content in confoundingly whimsical designs.</p>

<p>We all have the potential to succeed in this space for the very same reasons Marco succeeded in the digital magazine industry. Your success depends on whether or not you realize this though, and on the steps you take towards that goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should things pan out in Dish&#8217;s favor, we could very well see a fifth major carrier here in the US, something that would certainly shake things up in the wireless market. Whether or not Dish is able to accomplish that with Clearwire or by pursuing another deal will have to be seen, but we wouldn&#8217;t count the satellite provider out just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>In episode sixty-four of <a href="http:/5by5.tv/criticalpath">The Critical Path</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/64">Mano a Mano</a>, Horace Dediu and Benedict Evans discussed, among other things, the state of the cellular carriers throughout the world, with special focus paid to networks in the United States and the myriad difficulties an entrant would face against the incumbents.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly Horace and Benedict both made very insightful observations as to the impracticality of the move Dish seems to be making, and yet Dish nevertheless appears intent on becoming the fifth major carrier in the United States. It will be very interesting to see how this unfolds.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider makes one edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of edits doing things like changing the name of a category across the entire site &#160;&#8212;&#160; the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But it&#8217;s the outsiders who provide nearly all of the content.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz made a number of interesting observations and suggestions throughout this piece. Of those, this is my favorite, found near the end of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college. Writing essays isn&#8217;t a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned. Who would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations of two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little jokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little style, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the added benefit of padding things out.) Another way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem. Instead of building a web application, try building a web application framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The problem is that the topics that are most painful also tend to be the topics that are most important for us: they&#8217;re the projects we most want to do, the relationships we care most about, the decisions that have the biggest consequences for our future, the most dangerous risks that we run. We&#8217;re scared of them because we know the stakes are so high. But if we never think about them, then we can never do anything about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like Shawn Blanc, I too prefer to share interesting links I come across on my site rather than through Twitter or, dare I even say it, Facebook.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Like Lopp and Bowler, many people are migrating to Twitter as their outlet to share links. And while I think Twitter and App.net are great places for that, I personally like the idea of sharing most of the links I come across via my site.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I choose to link a post based on three criteria: my interest in the topic, whether I feel I can add to the conversation or not, and depending on the obscurity of the link. I don&#8217;t link to an article or a product if I&#8217;m not excited about it; I don&#8217;t want to waste my readers&#8217; time any more than I want to waste mine. If I can&#8217;t add to the conversation in a significant way, I simply won&#8217;t join it. There are already too many websites that do this. And for those gems hidden on the fiftieth page of Cabin Porn or buried at the end of a long article, I often link to those as a way to call attention to something excellent that otherwise might go unnoticed. That&#8217;s how I link, relying on the quality of my commentary and prudence in determining whether to link to an article or not to separate my site from the myriad others that have adopted the linkblog format. That&#8217;s how I define rather than copy.</p>

As I thought more and more about it though, as I read <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/01/27/apple-ready-to-release-additional-ipad-model-likely-128gb-version/">9to5 Mac&#8217;s coverage of the rumor</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/28/gurman-128">John Gruber&#8217;s take</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3926532/5th-generation-ipad-part-potentially-revealed-in-leaked-image">potential substantiation by The Verge shortly thereafter</a>, and as I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/52357425">A day in the life from Whole Larder Love</a>, the realization that the iPad 4 rumor was not what I wanted to write about slowly dawned on me. I suppose in order to give that epiphany any degree of substance I should provide some background.</p>

<p>I have been writing about one form of technology or another ever since I can remember. My first website, in fact, which I refuse to link every time I reference it out of a mixture of embarrassment and wonder that sometime so contrived could have ever been published to the internet, was about making websites. Ever since that first blog, I have written about technology with a particular focus on computers. Only recently, with the launch of this site, did I enter in to the reporting space, viewing it as the next logical step in my career as a blogger. The last few weeks, however, have seen my interests begin to shift. The culmination of this shift, I thought, was the number of posts I made over the past two days. Turns out&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>turns out</em>, as Marco is so fond of saying&#160;&#8212;&#160;I was wrong: the culmination was not the series of posts and articles about cabins, but instead my choice not to write about the 128GB iPad 4 rumor.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;re still here for that you might as well leave: I have nothing to say. Nothing to say about that anyways.</p>

<p>I suppose this transition was a long time coming, now that I think about it. For quite some time I have been fascinated with initiatives like YouTube Friday from Shawn Blanc, the most recent installment of which, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/01/those-who-make/">Those Who Make</a>, has continued to fascinate me for nearly a week with thought-provoking videos from&#160;&#8212;&#160;you guessed it&#160;&#8212;&#160;those who make things. Similarly, Ben Brooks&#8217;s departure from the tech reporting norm expected of Apple bloggers and successful venture into product reviews such as <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/knife-follow-up/">his excellent knife analysis</a> also captured my attention, as did Marco&#8217;s entrance into this space as well. <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/">Tools &#38; Toys</a>, a gadget and software review site Shawn Blanc runs, is the most recent example of this. All these ventures have one thing in particular in common: they are all a departure from the traditional, from &#8220;the tech reporting norm expected of Apple bloggers&#8221;.</p>

<p>I want to join Shawn, Ben, and Marco. I don&#8217;t want to be the next John Gruber with my linked list and succinct, witty quips. Not that there&#8217;s anything bad with that approach, that&#8217;s just not what I want from this website. No, I want this website to be something different, something out of the ordinary. I don&#8217;t want this website to be just another linkblog, pushing out post after post with my nuance opinion on an over-analyzed topic, merely parroting the thoughts and ideas of the bloggers I follow and admire. I want this blog to be an outlier, the one that bucks the trend; something extraordinary.</p>

<p><em>Keep in mind that I wrote this post last night before Apple officially announced the 128GB iPad 4. At that time it was still an unsubstantiated rumor.</em></p>

<p>I accidentally re-discovered this article last night as I was writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-128gb-ipad-4.html"><em>This Post is Not About the 128GB iPad 4</em></a>, as I was looking for the link to <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/knife-follow-up/">Ben Brooks&#8217;s knife reviews</a>. #20 is probably my favorite:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give a shit about what people think of your honest opinion. If you think Android is better than iOS, Windows better than Mac, and Nikon better than Canon &#160;&#8212;&#160; so be it.

<p>Pandering came to mind the first time I read this and once again this time around. Something to keep in mind as you produce any sort of content attracting widespread attention and thus widespread criticism as well.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, That Phone Guy is an act of sorts Merlin grew semi-famous for a few years ago, in which he would mimick &#8220;that phone guy&#8221; by talking loudly and obnoxiously into his wallet, often either next to or in the very near vicinity of the one he was mocking. Absolutely hilarious.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been making a lot of posts in the last 24 hours about Cabin Porn; I&#8217;ve written a lot and linked to even more. At the risk of sounding repetitive, if I could condense all the insight I have gained over the past two days into a single paragraph, it would be the opening lines from <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/13641808772/this-must-be-the-place-by-lost-found-films-50">John Coffer&#8217;s video</a> I linked to in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-must-be-the-place.html"><em>This Must Be the Place</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I was living in Florida and I had a nice two-bedroom condominium, a garage, a swimming pool, some tangerine trees outside, a sports car and a Ford van. It wasn&#8217;t really very fulfilling, in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something to it, this life of simplicity. Some choose to go whole-hog, to use a bad pun, as Rohan Anderson did with his hand crafted log cabin smokehouse. As an aside the video, which I linked to in passing partway through <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn.html">the original Cabin Porn post</a>, can be found on <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/31346968688/hunter-grower-gather-blogger-rohan-anderson-built">the Cabin Porn tumblr page</a>. Others choose simply to live more modestly. Regardless of the degree at which they enter into this lifestyle though, the mere fact that so many do it, to such amazing results, merits cause for pause in some level of consideration. There must be something to it, after all, something more than a cabin out in the woods&#160;&#8212;&#160;something more than meets the eye.</p>

<p>My problem, if it could even be called that, with my obviously beloved Cabin Porn tumblr is not really a problem as much as a twinge of disappointment I felt as I made my way through all fifty-six pages on the site. I was disappointed because as I neared and eventually surpassed the halfway point, fewer of the cabins were actually that: a cabin; rather, many of the structures featured on Cabin Porn were more akin to small houses than the cozy, generally handcrafted buildings nestled away from civilization I came to the site looking for. It got progressively worse as I approached the final page. Now granted, in recent years the folks at Beaver Brook have gotten much better at this, but it nevertheless left me feeling slightly dissatisfied when I closed page #56.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great thing about having my job evaporate into thin air was that we were able to move out of town to this nice, quiet place where the only traffic we ever see is the occasional passing of a neighbor&#8217;s dog team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My favorite detail: The chimney is built with stones collected from 30 different countries, a lifetime project for one of its previous, and apparently nomadic, owners.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if the unique and often quite intricate designs were not enough to separate these cabins.</p>

<p>Rather than posting separate articles for each cool cabin I came across or interesting story I found on <a href="http://freecabinporn.com">Cabin Porn</a> throughout this past day, I decided to condense the day&#8217;s updates into a single post. There are a few cabins, however, whose stories merited more than a simple line item on an imposingly long list, and for those I did make an exception.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/25183549412/from-peter-anderson-so-i-bought-a-140-acre-gold">140 Acre Gold Mining Claim</a>. Certainly not the nicest of cabins, and I don&#8217;t know much about real estate, but I&#8217;d say Peter Anderson made off with a steal at just $3,000 for this massive plot and the accompanying cabins. What a catch.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/24130198168/cabin-between-austria-and-slovenia-submitted-and">Cabin between Austria and Slovenia</a>. This view reminded me of a hike I took with a Boy Scout troop during my trip to South Africa in the hills surrounding Barberton. We hiked up the mountain one day, camped in a small building similar to this cabin, and rode bikes down the mountain the next day. Another very fond memory of my trip there.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/22253288058/adirondack-shelter-in-oil-creek-state-park">Adirondack</a>. I slept in this very adirondack one cold and rainy weekend a few years ago, and have spent many a night in an adirondack since then. Wonderful little buildings and a great way to spend the night.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/21784037353/hackney-shed-by-office-sian-in-london-england">Hackey Shed</a>. I absolutely love the idea of an open workspace such as this one and one that can easily be closed if the weather takes a turn for the worse while still allowing for a spectacular view.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/16440397386/hut-in-niigata-prefecture-japan-submitted-by">Hut</a>. I took a particular liking to this &#8220;cabin&#8221;, if it could even be called that, not because the structure was anything special, but because of the spectacular mountain range it sits atop. Absolutely beautiful.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/14362535618/allandale-house-by-william-obrien">Allandale House</a>. One of the more picturesque A-frames I was able to find on Cabin Porn.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/9077333990/andrew-ranvilles-puumaja-project-meaning">Puumaja project</a>. The first actual tree house I found on Cabin Porn: all the others were suspended mere feet from the ground. Very impressive&#160;&#8212;&#160;not only for designing a well thought-out tree house, but also in designing an attractive one.</li>

<p>A very cool website Shawn Blanc runs along with a small staff of other writers from around the internet. I first learned of Tools &#38; Toys in episode #25 of the CMD+SPACE podcast, <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/1/23/026-a-full-time-masterclass-with-shawn-blanc.html"><em>A &#8216;Full-Time&#8217; Masterclass, with Shawn Blanc</em></a>, and then spent some time earlier this afternoon taking a cursory look at the group&#8217;s work. Not surprisingly, it&#8217;s top-notch.</p>

<p>&#8220;A town within a city, a rebel neighborhood within a well-ordered society. This is Christiania (Freetown), Denmark, a small community smack dab in the middle of Copenhagen, Denmark. Within this community are tiny houses, built by hand and with whatever materials are within reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found this article through a link on the Cabin Porn tumblr page. Christiania is not only home to a number of impressive cabins though, but also to a curious way of life made all the more interesting by the rules the residents abide by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The 900 or so freethinking individuals who inhabit the area are a self governing community who refuse to pay taxes to the Danish government, run their own businesses and schools, live without cars on unpaved roads, build their own houses, restaurants and civil buildings and even have their own currency.&#8221;</p>

<p>To once again reference Ben Brooks&#8217;s article <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/01/design-workspace/"><em>Fatal Design Flaw of Workspaces</em></a>, he described his ideal workspace towards the end of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I often dream of my ideal workspace:</p>
<p>* 10,000 square foot space of nothing.</p>
<p>* Four foot by ten foot desk in the center, made of wood.</p>
<p>* Herman Miller Embody chair.</p>
<p>* Concrete floors.</p>
<p>* No windows.</p>
<p>* Thirty foot ceiling.</p>
<p>* Spot light illuminating only my desk.</p>
<p>* Just the laptop on the desk.</p>
<p>* No cables in sight.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I read this description, I couldn&#8217;t help but think about how different my own ideal workspace would be from this one. Where he dreams of a large expanse of nothing, dark except for well-lit area around his immaculate desk, I idealize a small cabin like the glass lodge linked at the top of this post: a bright, cozy space, isolated somewhere away from civilization where I can be alone to work. I suppose in that regard, at least, we can agree.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cabin at Beaver Brook is in a forest that used to be mostly dominated by white pines, the tallest trees in the Eastern United States. The forest was nearly clear cut and the logs were floated down the nearby Delaware River to Philadelphia where they were used as structural beams for buildings and British ships. ... Now, BB&#8217;s trees are mostly 40-50 years old, though I&#8217;m grateful there are still a few old growth trees to remind me of the previous magnificence of this historic forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>What struck me about this post as I scrolled through <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/">Cabin Porn</a> earlier this morning was not the sad story, but the cover of Erik Rutkow&#8217;s book: featuring two cowboys, for lack of a better term, amidst a huge forest of leviathan trees. It saddens me to think that today, we lack both.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t quite say for sure why I decided to go with this title, or, rather, what made it come to mind as the clock neared midnight last night. I had just finished <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-art-of-not-saying-anything.html"><em>The Art of Not Saying Anything</em></a> a few minutes ago, and some part of my mind was bemoaning the abandonment of a great majority of the lessons my English teacher instilled within me not long ago. Namely, to avoid be verbs and contractions; to write grammatically correct sentences; never to start a sentence with a conjunction; and never to address the reader directly. Over the past few months I have slowly abandoned many of these beliefs&#160;&#8212;&#160;these morals, if you will&#160;&#8212;&#160;one by one as I continue to evolve as a writer.</p>

<p>As I reflected upon <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn.html"><em>Cabin Porn</em></a> and finished <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-patron-saint-of-cabin-porn.html"><em>The Patron Saint of Cabin Porn</em></a> late last night, I thought back to something Jim Dalrymple and Merlin Mann talked about on the seventh episode of The Crossover, <a href="http://5by5.tv/crossover/7">We Met at a Tequila Bar</a>. It&#8217;s late and I can&#8217;t quite recall their exact words, but the gist of the discussion was that sometimes, you don&#8217;t always need to write a thousand words&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even a hundred, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;about something; sometimes, a simple &#8220;Yep.&#8221; will suffice. More is not always better.</p>

<p>In violation of one of my personal rules, not to listen to a podcast unless I can devote my full attention to it, I was putting the finishing touches on the latest iteration of First Crack during Jim and Merlin&#8217;s discussion, so I unfortunately did not pay much attention to it at the time. As I wrote <em>The Patron Saint of Cabin Porn</em> in particular though, those were the only words I could hear. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to let the article you&#8217;re writing about speak for itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 1968, at the age of 51, Dick left a life of ranching, carpentry and heavy machine repair to retire to Twin Lakes, Alaska in what is now Lake Clark National Park. Deposited by float plane, and carrying only the simplest of tools, he set out to build a homestead and survive the winter, alone in the wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found this partway through the first ten pages of <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/">Cabin Porn</a> last night. At fifty-one to attempt something many will never attempt in their lifetime...such an amazing story. Inge Wegge and Jorn Ranum <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/34097710799/in-2010-inge-wegge-and-j-rn-ranum-spent-9-months">did something similar in the Arctic Circle</a>:</p>

<p>&#8220;In 2010, Inge Wegge and Jorn Ranum spent 9 months above the Arctic Circle surfing, snowboarding, and subsisting in a cabin they built of driftwood, stone, and sea debris.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I finally got around to opening <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/">Cabin Porn</a> yesterday evening on another exotic living space binge brought on starting Friday afternoon with Ben Brooks&#8217;s article <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/01/design-workspace/"><em>Fatal Design Flaw of the Workspaces</em></a>, I was excited. Posts like <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/the-world-s-skinniest-house"><em>The World&#8217;s Skinniest House</em></a> and <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/tiny-houses"><em>Tiny Houses</em></a> over on Huckberry&#160;&#8212;&#160;both linked to in Ben&#8217;s article&#160;&#8212;&#160;had rekindled a long-extinguished flame somewhere inside of me, igniting that visceral desire to discover something new and interesting. Here are a few of my favorites, in no particular order. I would be the happiest man in the world to have any one of these amazing cabins.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/40519771077/off-grid-farmhouse-designed-by-studio-moffitt-in">Off-grid Farmhouse</a>. There&#8217;s just something about a wide open field of tall prairie grass waving in the gentle summer breeze that has always appealed to me. Every time I watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves">Dances with Wolves</a> I envy First Lieutenant John Dunbar as he walks through waist-high grass on those warm summer days, left with nothing to do but write in his journal.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/39929306273/sod-roofed-hut-in-geiranger-norway-submitted">Sod-roofed Hut</a>. I love the sharp rise and fall of a mountain range, the majesty of the land soaring high in the sky, just as much as a seemingly infinite prairie. I can&#8217;t even imagine what it would be like to step outside and see this view every day.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/39141117637/treehouse-near-the-embalse-del-neusa">Treehouse</a>. Nobody loves a nice forest as much as I do. There&#8217;s just something about knowing that I could walk for an entire day in any direction and still never meet another human that taps in to some base human desire to be alone, and to be alone in nature.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/38163763484/a-frame-in-southern-iceland-between-the">A-frame</a>. A dash of compromise: some woods, a few small hills, and an empty plain.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/33779384565/handbuilt-cabin-in-washington-state-writes-owner">Handbuilt</a>. Many of the cabins featured on Cabin Porn are hand built. Ah, to build such a thing as Hunter/grower/gatherer/blogger Rohan Anderson built a <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/31346968688/hunter-grower-gather-blogger-rohan-anderson-built">log cabin smokehouse</a> with his own two hands.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/33502084826/dawn-overlooking-mueller-hut-in-mt-cook-national">Mueller Hut</a>. Once before in my life have I seen a view such as that depicted in the first photo, when I was traveling in South Africa. One of my favorite memories of my trip there.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/31336533577/hand-built-floating-cabin-in-perry-creek-on-the">Floating Cabin</a>. As soon as I saw this cabin I immediately thought of a summer long ago spent at a friend&#8217;s cabin in the North Woods of Minnesota. A trip I will never forget.</li>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/30941312747/island-cabin-on-georgian-bay-ontario-canada">Island Cabin</a>. I&#8217;ve only been on an actual island a handful of times in my entire life. My earliest memory of such begins with a boat ride out to Put-in Bay; the last of a chilly night spent fishing and huddled around a campfire in the woods of West Virginia with a group of close friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>This site is not merely interesting because we get to see cool little houses built in interesting places. No, it&#8217;s interesting because it serves as a window into an ideology, another way of life&#160;&#8212;&#160;a different world view. Featuring books like <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/38229031987/from-our-library-handtools-their-ways-and">Handtools: Their Ways and Workings</a>, <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/37846024839/from-our-library-the-poetics-of-space-by-gaston">The Poetics of Space</a>, <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/37333822825/from-our-library-how-to-stay-alive-in-the-woods">How to Stay Alive in the Woods</a>, <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/35563006466/from-our-library-living-the-good-life-by-helen">Living the Good Life</a>, <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/33644158821/on-our-cabin-shelf-two-classic-books-about-maine">We Were an Island</a>, and <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/32198356423/john-seymour-was-an-advocate-for-self-reliance">The Self-Sufficient Life</a> to name just a few, Cabin Porn promotes such an admirable way of life we could all benefit from striving for.</p>

<p>And this is all just from the first ten pages, not even a fifth of the site.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-27 16:01:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/27 16:01:31 EST</time>
<p>Early Friday morning I started redesigning this site&#8217;s layout. I wanted to create a better reading experience and place more emphasis on my content, with particular attention paid to the latest articles. Two days later, in the wee hours of Sunday morning, I closed my computer having not only accomplished my initial goals, but also after successfully completing a long-overdue complete overhaul of the content mangement system I drive this site with, First Crack. For those unfamiliar with my work on this Markdown-based content management system, check out <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-first-crack.html"><em>Introducing First Crack</em></a> and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-in-practice.html"><em>First Crack in Practice</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition to eliminating nearly 100 lines of code, I have also greatly optimized the latest iteration of First Crack. For example, whereas the previous version opened and parsed each content file multiple times to build the home page, RSS feed, and article page, First Crack now reads and parses each line of each file only once. I did not only make performance improvements server-side in the Python script though, but also client-side with the removal of my dependancy on jQuery and an accompanying Javascript file to correctly display my site, along with a simplification of my site&#8217;s structure as well as CSS. All in all this is a huge step forward not only for First Crack, but for this site as well.</p>

<p>Along with the aforementioned improvements to First Crack, the CMS now supports a number of new features:</p>

<ul>
<li>New command line parameter: The latest version of First Crack brings with it a new option in its &#8220;Authoring&#8221; mode: &#8220;-u&#8221; for uploading a single file. Combined with the &#8220;-r&#8221; parameter used to rebuild a single structure file, these two options make minor fixes a breeze.</li>
<li>A more responsive design: Another goal I had when I set out to redesign my site last week was to build a more responsive design, a design that would not only be readable on a computer, but on a mobile device as well. While I still have some kinks to work out, this design is one step closer to providing the best possible experience regardless of the device my site is viewed through.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to little interest in the GitHub repo, I have ceased updating it; however, although <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">First Crack&#8217;s GitHub page</a> has stagnated, I still intend to open source First Crack upon its completion.</p>

<p>In pursuit of more perfect compromise between functionality and minimalism, Ben Brooks closed his article on minimalist spaces with an observation I found very vindicating, having made the switch almost wholly myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if my perfect office really involves a laptop, or if it would be perfect with only an iPad and keyboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;SplinterNet is a simple mobile app that allows users to author posts in a similar fashion to blogging or tweeting. These posts can contain text and a single image. However, rather than being hosting on internet servers, users distribute their posts by syncing with other app users via Bluetooth. The peer-to-peer syncing creates an ad hoc distribution network without requiring the use of mobile networks or any other monitored network infrastructure.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very interesting idea indeed, even when considered as simply another form of blogging&#160;&#8212;&#160;a new platform for microblogging, perhaps. I look forward to hearing more from this app&#8217;s creators as it evolves from development into a service suitable for widespread use.</p>

<p>I have a particular fondness for hand-crafted things, and a special spot in my heart for crafting those things myself. <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/thosewhomake/">Those Who Make</a> features masters of their respective crafts doing what they do best: making things. Since coming across the Vimeo channel in <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/01/those-who-make/">an article over on Shawn Blanc&#8217;s blog</a> last night, I only just managed to pull myself away for long enough to write this short post. As Shawn Blanc said, &#8220;Click through with caution &#160;&#8212;&#160; you may never come back.&#8221;</p>

<a class="original u-url" href="/blog/the-problems-with-icloud.html">The Problems with iCloud</a>
</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-26 18:28:21-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/26 18:28:21 EST</time>
<p>As a born PC user I rarely interact with iCloud on my main computer. Even on my iOS devices I rarely use iCloud, where, given the choice, I will choose Dropbox or some other method to sync documents and settings across devices. The most recent episode of Back to Work, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/103"><em>Lotta Little Knives</em></a>, brought the issue to a head in my mind, and Ben Brooks&#8217;s less recent article <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/01/archiving-cloud/"><em>Archived Data, in the Cloud</em></a>, in which he proposed an interesting solution to the topic at hand, prompted me to write this piece.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;How does a great cloud storage system work using the Fusion Drive model? Just swap &#8216;SSD&#8217; with &#8216;your local device&#8217; and &#8216;HDD&#8217; with &#8216;cloud&#8217;. The OS intelligently decides which files it should keep locally &#160;&#8212;&#160; everything else gets off-loaded to the cloud.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution, however, fails to solve the main problems with iCloud: that it tries to be everything to everyone, and that, even by Apple&#8217;s we&#8217;ll-make-it-work-don&#8217;t-worry-how standards, iCloud is an exceptionally closed system. Combined, these two aspects have led to inconsistent syncing and, most importantly, a profound feeling of doubt. In <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/statuses/126685517445206018c">a tweet from 2011</a>, Merlin Mann described Dropbox&#8217;s syncing experience, saying, &#8220;When I hit a button and &#8216;Send to Dropbox,&#8217; I for damn sure know where it is...it&#8217;s EVERYWHERE&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s never NOT everywhere.&#8221; Conversely, when I make a change to an application relying on iCloud as a back end, I don&#8217;t know where it is&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether that &#8220;it&#8221; is a file or a setting. That&#8217;s the problem with iCloud: it&#8217;s sometimes in some places. And that&#8217;s an inconsistency I, and many other people, cannot afford.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-24 14:32:54-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/24 14:32:54 EST</time>
<p>After writing my last post, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-next-step.html"><em>The Next Step</em></a>, and as I went back to perusing the steady stream of news and articles I proctor throughout the day, I started thinking about the prevalence of the Apple blog. I touched on this briefly in my last article. There&#8217;s a strangely pervasive mentality in the blogosphere these days that in order to be successful, one must do some combination of three things: write about Apple, adopt the linkblog format, and post regularly, the argument being that few companies are as interesting to write about as Apple. For the most part, I agree with these requirements: nobody writes about Microsoft anymore, because Microsoft isn&#8217;t doing anything revolutionary anymore; for the same reason, nobody writes about Samsung or Oracle or Adobe. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple is the only interesting company on the market. As I said in my previous post, Google is doing many of the same things Apple does and receives so much attention for, although granted often to a lesser degree. In fact, Google does even more with their much broader research and development division, leading to the creation of driverless vehicles, augmented reality glasses, and, most recently, an experimental cell network. No other company in the world can claim the same.</p>

<p>Apple is not the only interesting company we have the option to write about, but it is by far the easiest. There is no shortage of opinions on the latest product announcement or what the thermostat setting in Apple&#8217;s headquarters means for the future of the company. There is, however, a great shortage of opinions on the inner-workings of Google, on those actions hidden behind a white screen and jauntily colored logo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Google&#8217;s no stranger to crazy experiments, and not all of them will necessarily change the world: for every self-driving car and wearable display, there&#8217;s an army of employees working on personal engineering projects. But it doesn&#8217;t sound like that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221;  - Sean Hollister of The Verge in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/23/3909700/google-secret-wireless-network-maybe-dish-partnership">Google building secret wireless network, says it involves &#8216;highly competitive consumer electronics&#8217;</a>.</p>

<p>The last decade has seen Google evolve from a company focused on search and ad revenue to a multi-faceted corporation capable of producing everything from cell phones to the necessary software to operate those devices. These changes attracted but trivial sustained attention in a space defined and dominated by Apple bloggers and their copycats, as did the announcement that Google had entered into the internet service provider space with high speed fiber lines in select cities. Just as with the actions of Apple though, there is an interesting trend to be uncovered for those diligent enough to look for it.</p>

<p>Google began on the web; Apple, with physical devices. More than ten years later both companies have begun to encroach upon the other&#8217;s speciality, Google with the advent of the Chromebook and the acquisition of Nokia, and Apple as it begins to develop its ability to build competitive cloud services. Disregarding the question of whether these services are comparable&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether the Chromebook is comparable to a Macbook, for example, or if iCloud is a comparable service to Google Drive&#160;&#8212;&#160;and simply looking at these steps in their most basic form reveals a common trend, one that is often recognized with Apple but very seldomly, if at all, with respect to Google: the move towards complete vertical integration. In other words, complete control of every aspect of the user&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p>With the rumor that Google may soon begin developing its own cellular network, we see another step towards that goal of complete control, one that Apple has yet to undertake.</p>

<p>Although the trailer features few live scenes from actual gameplay, it does exhibit impressive graphics especially when compared to traditional video game animations. I have high hopes for this game, and look forward to the day when live gameplay will be indiscernible from the animation used in the trailer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when we&#8217;re gone, its hydrogen will still continue fusing, irrespective of the politics of our successor race, whatever species next decides to fill its nearest star with qualities like love, intentionality, goodwill, and grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>I take some issue with this fatalistic point of view. The hydrogen will indeed continue fusing regardless of the majority of the decisions we make today, but that fact should not be used to discount the change we can implement today to in some way effect future change.</p>

<p>In a space increasingly defined by Apple bloggers and their copycats, it is not only interesting to see another writer&#8217;s process, but also to see how that creator works towards such a different end product using largely the same tools as those obfuscating this space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally what he&#8217;s doing is quite simple: he tweets, and he retweets. A lot. Sometimes he goes 20 hours at a stretch, collating from those he follows and passing information on to his eighty thousand followers. He often interjects questions or critiques, building on what he&#8217;s read and recruiting fact-checkers. The result can be simultaneously cacophonous, intimate, and illuminating.&#8221;</p>

<p>A particularly astute observation from my favorite blog, Blogarach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;America is a nation of tantrum-throwing moral infants that&#8217;s been dragged bawling out of the crib of its own moral and ethical object impermanence, and even now it&#8217;s kicking and screaming on the floor of the department store, yelling that some black guy got into a California law school ahead of a deserving white.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another post from what is quickly becoming my favorite blog, and one of the few sites whose articles I consistent read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;For all the po-faced, high-church sentimentality and stentorian sententiousness of the quadrennial American coronation day, there&#8217;s something almost charmingly&#160;&#8212;&#160;and disarmingly&#160;&#8212;&#160;tacky about our great national junket jubilee, a certain plastic tablecloth, fire-hall wedding, warming-tray ziti trashiness that makes the fact that we are ultimately celebrating the ratification of one more dude&#8217;s right to once more screw the poor and bomb the fuck out the rest of the world slightly more tolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Siracusa in an article from 2010, in which he briefly discusses the problem faced by those wishing to enter into blogging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Of course, now I just spent 20 minutes futzing with Tumblr themes (before giving up when I realized that I won&#8217;t be happy with the results without investing many, many more hours) instead of writing the the post that motivated this little excursion in the first place.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For non-technical people, the problem is undoubtedly even worse. And while the advent of sites like Squarespace aim to lower the bar of entry, it is nevertheless still all too high, an unnecessary barrier preventing smart people from easily sharing their knowledge with the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The changes to my working (and sleeping) routine have forced me to write when it&#8217;s time to write, not when I feel inspired.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the time I didn&#8217;t understand the concept of writing when it was time to write rather than when I felt inspired, which is why I didn&#8217;t pay a great deal of attention to this article when Shawn Blanc first released it. At the time, I wrote when I felt inspired, not when it was time to write. At the time, there was no specific time to write, all the time was the time to write. And then my schedule got busy, and now I stay up late to write because it&#8217;s what I love to do. Now I write when it&#8217;s time to write.</p>

<p>When I first saw this tweet roll by in my feeds either earlier this week I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it. As I sit here and it&#8217;s nearly midnight, however, John Gruber&#8217;s excerpt came to mind: &#8220;Midnight: Hunter ready to write.&#8221; These days I have very small windows in which to write in: between homework and class during the day, and after I return home from FRC practice at 9:30 (at the earliest) each night. Outside of those small windows, which are all to frequently filled by one thing or another, I have the weekends. The weekends and midnight.</p>

<p>A few days ago in preparation for posting <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/aaron-swartz.html"><em>We Have Lost One of Our Own</em></a>, a short article I wrote eulogizing Aaron Swartz in response to the news that he had committed suicide, I spent some time perusing his work. This article, Take a Step Back, is one of the many I saved to Instapaper, and the one in which I found this interesting tidbit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are the blogs on &#8216;life hacks,&#8217; which are full of gadgets and gizmos that seem to cause more problems than they solve. There are the anti-procrastination blogs, where the author has a constant stream of epiphanies that all seem to amount to &#8216;just put away the distractions and get stuff done.&#8217; And there are the charlatans, who tell you that all your wildest dreams can come true if you just follow their patented advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The title reworked for this article, Reginald Braithwaite&#8217;s article <a href="http://raganwald.posterous.com/why-the-fuck"><em>Why the Fuck?</em></a> posted earlier today not only made it to the Hacker News front page, but to the top spot. He makes an interesting point to begin with, and then anticlimactically ended the piece with a call to arms in the fight against diabetes and obesity. But that&#8217;s his point: today the glamorous projects aren&#8217;t the ones helping people. The greatest technical minds of the previous generation spend their time at the Googles and Apples, at the Facebooks and Microsofts of today. Will we follow in their footsteps, or strike out on our own? And for those that do choose to walk a different path, where will that path lead?</p>

Not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t use Simplenote, and unfortunately I&#8217;ve noticed some of the synching problems he has. Nevertheless Simplenote remains the best on the market, and for that single reason I will continue to keep all my notes, to write all my articles, and to store nearly every bit of textual information I come in contact with in this app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing through the window is Outside. Now, I&#8217;m not a massive fan of Outside, generally speaking - I&#8217;m of the belief that we coped with Outside for a long time, until we finally invented Inside, and then breathed a huge sigh of relief - but it can really clear your head and restore some perspective. And sanity. And apparently vitamin D, or something, but health is a worry for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>An interesting article posted over on Blogarach in response to Aaron Swartz&#8217;s death. Even more impressive is that it&#8217;s a single, extremely well-written sentence. Worth the read even if you are not following the tragedy that is Aaron Swartz&#8217;s suicide.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight minutes and eleven seconds in to <a href="http://5by5.tv/bb/18">the eighteenth episode</a> of <a href="http://5by5.tv/bb/">The B&#38;B Podcast</a>, Shawn Blanc, in response to Ben Brooks talking about the salient point of his Lion review, said, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t boil down your whole article into a tweet, what are you doing writing the article in the first place?&#8221; Amidst a discussion regarding Ben and Shanw&#8217;s recent Lion and Web OS reviews, respectively, this humble observation is easy to miss as its brevity belies its profundity. This modest phrase said in passing is nevertheless one of the most profound insights into the writer&#8217;s craft I have ever come across.</p>

<p>An article from Ben Brooks posted in November of last year I had near the middle of my Simplenote list, burried beneath a slew of notes, ideas, and half-baked articles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested in writing when it&#8217;s not about the writing. iBooks Author is neat, but I don&#8217;t want to learn it - instead I&#8217;ll just &#8220;publish&#8221; the book here as a series of posts, where I know what I am doing (somewhat) and where writing is about writing and not layout, marketing, legal issues, notices, copyrights, glossaries, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with his conclusion, as I&#8217;m sure many writers do. That&#8217;s why, in part, I built First Crack: so that once it was working, I didn&#8217;t need to worry about the logistics and nitpicky details of publication. Instead, I could write in an environment in which &#8220;writing is about writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Matt Alexander of One Thirty Seven made so many interesting points I had a hard time choosing an excerpt of acceptable length for this post. I ended up settling on this one though, reflective of the tone throughout his exceptionally well-written article <em>We&#8217;re Boring, They&#8217;re Sexting</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Sitting on the front porch of our quaint weblogs and latte-art-filled Instagram accounts, we&#8217;re collectively yelling at the kids playing in the street using these platforms in newer, happier, and increasingly care-free ways. These kids have been born into a world of social networking and privacy concerns are literally the last things on their minds. They&#8217;re just looking for the next best way to chat, flirt, and sext their way into each other&#8217;s bedrooms, whilst we continue to perpetuate unwritten societal rules of etiquette for Twitter and Facebook.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t say enough good things about this piece&#160;&#8212;&#160;just go read it for yourself. And while you&#8217;re at it, read Josh Miller&#8217;s post referenced in the first paragraph of Matt Alexander&#8217;s article, <a href="https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3"><em>Tenth Grade Tech Trends</em></a>.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-14 15:41:24-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/14 15:41:24 EST</time>
<p>As I concluded <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/defining-an-industry.html"><em>Defining an Industry</em></a> I again found myself once again trying to decide whether I should continue writing or stop where I was. On the one hand I was happy with the article&#8217;s length, approximately 550 words. On the other hand though, I really wanted to spend some time talking about being overtaken in a market and about market cannibalization. Ultimately proposing that adhering to industry standards in a given market will not perpetuate success, for in such a case a newcomer unbeholden to existing stigmas will eventually enter and surpass the incumbents, I felt such a topic would fit nicely in <em>Defining an Industry</em>. The more I thought about it though the less I agreed with my initial sentiment though, so I finished the piece, saved it for posting at a later date, and began this article.</p>

<p>Look back six years to January of 2007: the dominant smartphone platforms are primarily RIM and HP, and they have been for a number of years. So long, in fact, that it would not have been out of line to say that innovation in this space had nearly stagnated. Less than six months later, Apple released the iPhone; the world of smartphones would never be the same.</p>

<p>Now look back just three years, this time honing in on the computing industry. Netbooks are the hot topic these days. Offering extreme portability and unheard of battery life, computing power seemed like such a small price to pay for the obvious benefits these devices. Unlike in the smartphone market three years ago innovation was in full swing when the iPad launched in the beginning of April. Nevertheless, it took the portable computing industry by storm; by the end of the year, Netbooks were already a fading memory, and the tablet industry was booming with Apple in the lead.</p>

<p>To adopt the format of the article these ideas nearly went into, the consistent vein present in these two anecdotes is stagnation. Stagnation, and the opportunity created along with it. In the case of the smartphone market, innovation had stagnated; little was being done in the way of major disruption to the proven successful products. When Apple released the iPhone, they released a device &#8220;five years ahead of anything the competition had to offer&#8221; in the words of Steve Jobs. The portable computing industry, however, had stagnated in a different way: while innovation was certainly taking place, it was only occurring within the netbook space, a narrow segment of the industry as a whole. Apple recognized this and chose to look outside that crowded space, where it developed the iPad. As a result of these two wildly successful products, Apple grew to become the most profitable company in the world. These are both well known stories, and stories you are undoubtedly very familiar with. Consider this next example as well:</p>

<p>Following its release in 2004, the iPod Mini soon became the most popular electronic device on the market. Twenty months later, with sales still going strong, Apple discontinued the product. A curious decision for sure, when canceled the iPod Mini was Apple&#8217;s most popular product. A year after that, Apple released the iPod Nano.</p>

<p>This is the first example of market cannibalization within the Apple product line: Apple discontinued a wildly successful device in order to release a similar, new device soon after. With the launch of the iPhone 2, Apple perfected this strategy: whereas with the iPod Mini Apple had discontinued the previous version before releasing the new iteration, the first iPhone remained available long after the company released the iPhone 2. Now, rather than discontinuing the outmoded product, Apple shifted it to a lower price point, thereby capturing the high end with the latest version and a slightly lower tier with the previous version. In exchange for capturing the wider product base, Apple cannibalized the iPhone 1 market, transferring a portion of that revenue stream to the iPhone 2 while simultaneously attracting another segment of the market with the iPhone 1. Apple continues to implement this strategy today.</p>

<p>The release of the iPad Mini was simply a supplement to this rule. Although the proven successful strategy of using the previous iteration as the moderately priced, entry level device was working with the iPad, no amount of versioning and price reduction could transform the tablet into a different form factor, the form factor the iPad Mini now occupies.</p>

<p>Along with the release of the iPad Mini many prophesied cannibalization of the iPad&#8217;s market without realizing that Apple had already been doing this with other products, and without realizing the obvious differentiating factor in the two devices: the form factor. The iPad Mini allowed Apple to not only occupy the high-end tablet market with the iPad and the high-end smartphone market with the iPhone, but also the previously-unoccupied (by Apple) market for medium-sized tablets. With the versioning strategy first implemented with the iPod Mini, Apple is now uniquely positioned to saturate the market at the high-end level with quality devices of varying form factors and of varying prices.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been spending a lot of time thinking about disruption theory. I&#8217;m writing articles about podcasting, technology, and education, in which 5by5, Apple, and the likes of The Khan Academy are disrupting the incumbents in their respective industries to superb results. 5by5 proved the viability of business based on podcasts, and explosive growth in this space ensued as the medium gained increasingly widespread recognition outside of geek circles. This growth and Dan&#8217;s business model set into motion a renaissance of sorts and provided the foundation for the advent of companies like 70 Decibels and The Mule Radio Syndicate, and many more to come.</p>

<p>Before the iPod, CD players and the last vestiges of the dying cassette era saturated the portable media player market. Few complained though, because at the time these devices epitomized some of the most advanced technology of the day. Many believed these devices would stay at the forefront of technology for the foreseeable future. Then Apple entered the market and revolutionized the industry with a product comparable to many devices still sold today. Apple did the same with the smartphone market when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, to even greater results.</p>

<p>Similarly, the need for education reform is no secret: many have been talking about it for quite some time while America continues to grow each and every day. As John Roderick said on an episode of <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>, &#8220;At no previous point in history were there three hundred million Americans. You cannot educate three hundred million people the same way that you would educate twenty million people.&#8221; The manner in which to go about that reform, however, has eluded many as they cling to the &#8220;tried and true&#8221; Prussian education system, a methodology whose origins trace back to the nineteenth century. Ever so slowly Salman Khan&#8217;s The Khan Academy is beginning to make inroads in public schools throughout the nation though, providing that much-needed reform.</p>

<p>The consistent vein that runs through each of these brief anecdotes is that prior to the disruptor&#8217;s entrance, podcasting was a niche market filled with generally sub-par broadcasts, low-quality devices permeated the personal computing industry, and learning took place in a classroom behind a desk in front of a teacher for all but a small minority. Prior to the disruptors&#8217; entrance these industries were reasonably clear cut and well-defined, and then that definition changed as it will undoubtedly change again in the near future.</p>

<p>These observations contain an important lesson for those who pay attention: you cannot absolutely define an industry. Through the wisdom of hindsight we can look back and scoff at those saying that the portable media player market <em>is</em> CD players, that the smartphone market <em>is</em> RIM, or that the portable computing market <em>is</em> netbooks. But at the time, the portable media player market was CD players, and the smartphone market was RIM, and the portable computing market was netbooks&#160;&#8212;&#160;those products defined their respective industries for a time. But then those definitions changed because a newcomer unbeholden to these pre-existing stigmas entered the industry and the markets were redefined.</p>

<p>You cannot adhere to the definition of an industry and simultaneously perpetuate success. After all, there are only so many possible innovations in a portable media player market defined as the market in which CD players are sold.</p>

<p>From Christine Pelisek&#8217;s article on The Daily Beast, I thought these two excerpts were of particular interest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the wake of the Newtown tragedy, NRA executive Wayne LaPierre drew criticism for suggesting that posting armed guards in schools could help prevent future shootings. Taft Union High School does employ an armed officer on campus, but he was snowed in on Thursday and did not make it to work.</p>
<p>In another ironic twist, the shooting happened just a few hours after the school held a staff meeting to talk about how to deal with shootings like the one in Newtown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this one later in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We can have all the gun control in the world but he was going to take [the gun] to school,&#8221; said Youngblood about the suspect. &#8220;It is an issue of mental health more than it is gun control. It is not normal to get a shotgun, walk into class, and shoot someone. That is not a normal reaction of someone who thinks he is being picked on.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The barrier to entry for pirating music, movies, or software discourages casual piracy; it does not pose anything other than a minor convenience, if even that, to anyone determined to download Carrie Underwood&#8217;s latest album without spending a cent. The question, then, and Sherif Youngblood got to this point in the article as well, must be asked: &#8220;How much of a difference will stricter gun laws make?&#8221; The shooter at each and every one of these recent school shootings obtained the weapon from an adult family member or friend. How far must new gun laws reach in order to keep the weapons out of the hands of troubled young individuals, and at which point do the ends no longer justify the means?</p>

<p>Earlier today I stumbled across an interesting article called <a href="http://stupidiswinning.tumblr.com/post/40268049719/we-are-in-the-final-years-of-our-internet">We Are In The Final Years of Our Internet</a> over on Stupid Is Winning explaining why the author believes the internet as we know it is likely to gradually fade as a younger, more tech savvy generation comes of age. The author is hypothesizing that a generation raised on touch screens and iTunes is unlikely to use the internet in the same way it is used now, which will eventually bring about a revolution of sorts in which the computing world and the internet in particular centers around specific apps rather than the browser. Perhaps the most interesting part in the article is not the main body, however, but the &#8220;jumbled thoughts in no order&#8221; at the bottom of the post, where the author proposes a number of questions and scenarios. Rather than a certainty though&#160;&#8212;&#160;the idea that the world of technology and the internet in particular are destined to change dramatically in the near future&#160;&#8212;&#160;I think we need to ask ourselves these questions: what is the possibility of reaching an asymptote in the near future at which point the need for innovation ceases? Before you answer, consider another: does anyone really want a phone the size of a bluetooth dongle&#160;&#8212;&#160;a Siri phone? does anymore <em>really</em> want a computer inside their head? Perhaps ranging into the dystopian extreme with the latter scenario, the thought nevertheless begs the question, &#8220;Is there a point at which we will have innovated <em>enough</em> that further innovation and future disruption is not only unwanted but also&#160;&#8212;&#160;and most importantly&#160;&#8212;&#160;unwarranted?&#8221;</p>

<p>An interesting collection of thoughts and observations regarding the meaning of life. These are my two favorites, the first from Frank Donofrio:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been asking myself why I&#8217;m here most of my life. If there&#8217;s a purpose I don&#8217;t care anymore. I&#8217;m seventy-four. I&#8217;m on my way out. Let the young people learn the hard way, like I did. No one ever told me anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Charles Bukowski:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can&#8217;t readily accept the God formula, the big answers don&#8217;t remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God.</p>
<p>We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our educational system.</p>
<p>We are here to drink beer.</p>
<p>We are here to kill war.</p>
<p>We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.</p>
<p>We are here to read these words from all these wise men and women who will tell us that we are here for different reasons and the same reason.</p>

<p>I planned to work on a number of articles this evening, but then, after I got home a short while ago and opened Hacker News, my evening plans changed as I began to read about Aaron Swartz. Rather than attempt to write about a man I know little of and who I knew nothing of before this afternoon, here are the better articles I have seen floating around the internet:</p>

<p>When I think of music piracy, getting caught is not the first thing that comes to mind. Before the story from a few years ago of a woman fined millions of dollars for sharing less than 25 songs on Limewire, before the story of a young girl&#8217;s Hello Kitty laptop being confiscated for sharing music&#160;&#8212;&#160;before either of those or the myriad other cases, Limewire, Frostwire, torrenting, and sites like Pillage and Sogou roll to the front. Getting caught is not the first thing that comes to mind when I think of music piracy. That&#8217;s why music labels feel the need to so excessively penalize those caught doing the wrong &#8220;thing&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;whatever that &#8220;thing&#8221; may be depending on the medium, the time of day, and the wind direction&#160;&#8212;&#160;and why they feel the need to make an example out of the few in order to send a message to the many. A byzantine tactic for sure, it has nevertheless permeated our judicial system and thus, unfortunately, has been allowed to continue. Aaron Swartz is the latest casualty in this abhorrent, excessive, and ineffective exertion of power. This time though, unlike all the last, the prize claimed was not monetary, but the priceless life of a young individual. But hey, those scientific journals, reportedly worth millions according to the prosecutors via Lawrence Lessig&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least they are safe. At least. They. Are. Safe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don&#8217;t get both, you don&#8217;t deserve to have the power of the United States government behind you.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is an excerpt from Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s <em>Prosecutor as Bully</em>. There is absolutely no reason that poor woman I heard about on the radio four years ago should have been charged even a minute fraction of what she was eventually forced to pay; there was no reason that little girl&#8217;s laptop should have been taken from her&#160;&#8212;&#160;she was ten years old; and there was absolutely no reason for Aaron Swartz to lose his life. In a word, it is inexcusable. Absolutely, totally, embarrassingly, and so blatantly obvious it&#8217;s painful, inexcusable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;To the world: we have all lost someone today who had more work to do, and who made the world a better place when he did it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An excerpt from Cory Doctorow&#8217;s previously cited article. At this point I feel that continuing any further would be next to meaningless, serving only add to the noise surrounding Aaron Swartz&#8217;s death. Instead, I encourage you to, as I will, go out and read some of <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron&#8217;s blog posts</a>, learn more about the man he was, and learn about the system that drove him to end what would have a world-changing life. I will close with this excerpt from <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2013Jan/0017.html">the small poem Tim Berners-Lee wrote</a>, then, with this single line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;we have lost one of our own.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Addendum: and let his loss not be in vain.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-11 14:46:12-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/11 14:46:12 EST</time>
<p>Last month I published <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-first-crack.html"><em>Introducing First Crack</em></a> shortly after this site went life. In that post I outlined a number of goals I set for First Crack during its development, as well as a few of the advantages I believed my new CMS would have over the incumbents. Since making that post nearly two months have gone by. During those two months I have used First Crack exclusively, and I have not looked back.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Customization">Customization<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Customization">#</a></span></h3>

<p>One of the main motivations behind the advent of First Crack as well as one of my main goals in designing it was to facilitate a great degree of customization. Not only in the site&#8217;s look and feel, but also in the way the CMS works. Just a few weeks ago I did a total redesign of the site. I started with blank HTML, CSS, and Javascript documents, designed the new site, and fed it into First Crack; the build went off without a hitch.</p>

<p>In addition to redesigning this site, I have also added a number of features to First Crack over the past few months, some of which I will touch on later in this article. Thanks to First Crack&#8217;s modular design and well-documented code it was very easy for me to make these changes. All in all I am very satisfied with First Crack&#8217;s customizability.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Simplicity">Simplicity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Simplicity">#</a></span></h3>

<p>As with my goal of complete customization, I feel my intent to make the installation and use of First Crack as easy as possible has been achieved. This process was extremely simple to begin with, and little has changed since then.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Speed">Speed<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Speed">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I designed First Crack to be as quick as possible with the relatively limited programming knowledge I have as compared to the developers of other content management systems. Pursuant of that goal, roughly a third of the way in to the development of First Crack, I shifted from dynamically generating pages to using static files. This made my site much less complicated to debug and also caused it to preform much faster. These were both great boons to my system over some of the others I had tried and heard about in the past.</p>

<p>My decision to employ static pages rather than generating them on the fly proved to be a good choice: without any prior caching, my website loads in just under a second on relatively low-end servers; with caching, that time is cut in half. Generating the site is also very quick, even when I force First Crack to rebuild every article from source: updating a single article, along with parsing the first paragraph of every post for the front page and generating the RSS feed, takes less than three seconds with thirty-one articles; rebuilding all the articles on the site, including the homepage and RSS feed, takes around five seconds. First Crack is very fast.</p>

<p>Over Christmas Break a few weeks ago I began adding a few new features to First Crack. In addition to simple regular expression improvements and greater versatility, I added the ability to automatically update the site over FTP as well. Now, entering the &#8220;authoring mode&#8221; with the -a parameter has another option in the list of acceptable commands: -U. Entering -U at the prompt instructs First Crack to upload the entire site&#160;&#8212;&#160;HTML, CSS, and Javascript&#160;&#8212;&#160;to a server specified within the CMS, thereby eliminating the need for me to manually update the site. I have also increased the granularity with which a post&#8217;s publish date can be manually modified. Whereas previously First Crack only allowed for the date to be set with granularity down to the day, entering -t at the prompt now asks for an update time down to the second.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I have been using First Crack for nearly two months, and I haven&#8217;t looked back once. First Crack is everything i need in a CMS, and should I happen to come across something I need but do not have, I have the ability to build it. The previous version of First Crack is available <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">on GitHub</a>. If I get around to updating it soon, the new version will be there as well; however, the previous version will work just fine for whatever you need it to do. So go and try it out and tell me what you think. I welcome any sort of feedback.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/perspective.html"><em>From the Notepad: Perspective</em></a> I started doing something the result of which I am very pleased with, and something I plan to continue in the future&#160;&#8212;&#160;an innovation of sorts: it&#8217;s not a post made in the traditional linkblog format, but it does draw some inspiration from it; it&#8217;s not a full-fledged article, it&#8217;s much more concise and to the point; it&#8217;s not an overly simplified, minified post condensed into a near-inscrutable tweet; it&#8217;s somewhere in between all of those, in a space I feel I can occupy very well. Rather than writing a full-fledged post for each of the myriad notes I have created over the past months in Simplenote, I will begin posting whatever I have collected for the potential topic as I would a linked item: with the excerpt as a blockquote along with some commentary if I deem it necessary. These types of post will allow me to expedite the publishing process without expending the extensive time and effort required to make a full-fledged post, thereby making it possible for me to post more frequently and in more easily digested modules.</p>

<p>When Francis Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s daughter entered into high school, he wrote her a short letter. In this letter, he cautioned against following in his own footsteps in becoming a writer, while simultaneously encouraging her to pursue her dreams and not to get discouraged when her work fell short of her expectations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Nobody ever became a writer just by wanting to be one. If you have anything to say, anything you feel nobody has ever said before, you have got to feel it so desperately that you will find some way to say it that nobody has ever found before, so that the thing you have to say and the way of saying it blend as one matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;as indissolubly as if they were conceived together.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting point of view to keep in mind.</p>

<p>With this post I thought I would try something different: rather than writing a full-fledged post for each of the myriad notes I have created over the past months in Simplenote, I will begin posting whatever I have collected for the potential topic as I would a linked item: with the excerpt as a blockquote along with some commentary if I deem it necessary. With that, then, the first post taken straight from my notepad, in which I attempt to frame the omniscient platform war with a bit of perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As we traverse the geek circles and move throughout our various nerd cliques, we get out of touch. My girlfriend just upgraded from an outmoded slider phone to the Samsung Galaxy I, and she loves it. She&#8217;s not complaining because it doesn&#8217;t have the App Store, she just loves it. And it doesn&#8217;t even look that bad: we get into the habit of vilifying Android and its derivatives, and in doing so get out of touch with what really matters to a good user experience with a phone versus the features only important in a pragmatic exercise.&#8221;</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2013-01-05 17:59:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-01.html">01</a>/05 17:59:31 EST</time>
<p>Over the course of the last few days I have begun developing a new app to replace <a href="http://hnpickup.appspot.com/">Hacker News Story Pickup Rate</a>, a site that aims to take the guesswork out of submitting stories to Hacker News by using various heuristics to determine the best time to submit a story in order to gain the most attention. Partway through last week Hacker News Story Pickup Rate went down, and as of January 1st it had not gone back online.</p>

<p>This afternoon, as I began testing a few new metrics by which to judge site activity, I started refreshing the &#8220;New&#8221; page on Hacker News to judge the progression of timestamps on each of the articles. My goal was to catch a just-submitted article by another user in order to determine whether new articles appear to the public dated &#8220;0 Minutes ago&#8221; or automatically marked as having been submitted &#8220;1 Minutes ago&#8221;. Naturally, then, in order to catch an article within such a small window, I refreshed the page very often&#160;&#8212;&#160;roughly twice every three seconds or so. I did this for around thirty seconds, then I received a 324 error stating that the server had severed the connection without serving any content. Curious, I took all the usual steps one might go through to resolve a strange occurrence such as this one: I tried refreshing the page again, clearing my cache, and restarting Chrome. All of those failing, I checked <a href="http://www.isup.me">Down For Everyone or Just Me?</a>, a service that, as the name suggests, will query a given website to determine whether it has gone offline or if it is only unavailable to you; it was just me.</p>

<p>At this point I really started getting curious, so I dug Internet Explorer out of its grave, resuscitated the long-since dead browser, and managed to get it running long enough to find that it too would not open Hacker News. I also tried opening Hacker News first on my iPad, then on my iPhone, and then on another computer in my house, but received the same result from all instances: a 324 error. As a last resort I then started Tor and opened Hacker News; it opened just fine. Tor is essentially a very sophisticated proxy that routs internet traffic through a bundled version of Firefox Portable in order to preserve the anonymity of its users. Pursuant of that goal, Tor masks the user&#8217;s IP address, location, and other aspects that can be used to positively identify a computer. by first encrypting any web traffic directed through Firefox Portable and then passing that traffic to relay points around the world where it is decrypted and parsed to return the desired webpage. The fact that Hacker News loaded in Tor led me to a theory I corroborated a few minutes later by disabling WiFi on my iPhone and successfully loading Hacker News through my cellular data connection: for some reason, my router blacklisted Hacker News. And just Hacker News too, not the top-level domain ycombinator.org or any of its other subdomains; just news.ycombinator.org.</p>

<p>Although I spent the rest of the evening trying everything from resetting my modem to updating my router&#8217;s firmware, Hacker News remains blacklisted on my network. It&#8217;s a simple enough workaround using a proxy such as <a href="http://www.uswebproxy.com/">US Web Proxy</a>, but it is nevertheless a great inconvenience both in that I cannot as easily obsessively check Hacker News throughout the day, and that it had put a stop to the development of a new app I&#8217;m creating to replace <a href="http://hnpickup.appspot.com/">Hacker News Story Pickup Rate</a>.</p>

<p>During my flight earlier this afternoon I started writing an article tentatively titled &#8220;I Should Blog Full Time, But I Can&#8217;t&#8221;, the first two paragraphs of which I have included below:</p>

<p>"I absolutely love to write. Writing is one of my favorite things to do. That&#8217;s why, in part, I started blogging; however, back then my interest in the coding side of the business trumped my interest in writing, and served as the driving force behind my continued involvement in this space. Today, many things, including my motivations for continuing to write online, have changed: the likes of John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple have transformed this industry from a hobby space to a profession that, while it would be a stretch to designate it as respected, continues to gain widespread regard as it slowly becomes less strange to say, &#8216;I write for a living.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I started this website just over a month ago during Thanksgiving break, I had fanciful aspirations that I would one day be able to take writing for this site full time and earn a comfortable living doing the thing I love, much as the bloggers I hold in high esteem have successfully done. I still have this goal; however, just over a month later I have been sobered by the harsh realization that, at least as it stands now, I can&#8217;t write full time even though I desperately want to. It&#8217;s not simply a matter of not having the time anymore as I return to school next week though, for I am of the firm belief that it is never a question of not having enough time to do something but instead a question regarding your desire to do that something over all the other somethings in your life, but also&#8221;</p>

<p>The first paragraph still holds true; it is in the second paragraph, however, the I found issue and cause to eventually rejected the premise of this article. I spent nearly half an hour trying to figure out just what it was that was stopping me from writing more regularly, trying to decide how I was going to finish that last sentence. But try as I might I could not come up with a single defensible position, especially after I wrote my short Merlinism at the end of the second paragraph. That&#8217;s when I realized, 38000 feet in the air, that I needed to start taking my own advice: I don&#8217;t need shorter school days in order to write more regularly and possibly even at a level where I could take this site from a hobby as it is now to a revenue-generating enterprise: although those would be nice, I need, as Merlin Mann said in the first episode of Back to Work, the compensatory muscles to do exactly what I need to sit in a chair and move my hands. As I strayed from the simple truth I began attempting to ask the wrong questions in order to solve the wrong problem, when in actuality I should have been spending that time doing the very thing I was trying in all the wrong ways to accomplish more of; I should have simply been writing.</p>

<p>I still don&#8217;t feel able to take writing for this site full time yet, but I do intend to continue creating in the hopes of perfecting my skills and developing my own voice that, someday, will hopefully ring out above all the others competing for the same time and attention I aim to occupy.</p>

<p>It happened when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, and it happened again when he introduced the iPad: a new player entered a market stagnated by incumbents and surprised everyone by tossing the norm out the window and ushering in a new era through the door. On a much smaller scale this happened earlier last week when I stumbled across <a href="http://cycloramic.com/">Cyloramic</a>, a neat little iOS app for the iPhone 5 that uses vibration patterns to spin the phone in a full circle and take a panoramic shot of its surroundings.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks ago I was thinking about ways to solve this very problem. Many have tried in the past with various mounts and stands, and those were the kinds of solutions I was considering: something based off of existing technologies. Then, just as Apple did with the mobile computing market twice already, Egos Ventures entered the fray and said, &#8220;Hold up, this is how it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few years ago, when I lived in Minnesota, my friend and I split our time between two activities: building robots and building rockets. We built our robots of Legos and our rockets of cardboard and balsa wood. When we weren&#8217;t occupied with one of those endeavors we spent our evenings racing his go-cart around the empty parking lot across from his house, our afternoons building zip lines in his backyard instead of doing the work we were supposed to, and our mornings being homeschooled by our moms. Outside of that relatively small allocation to formalized learning, we were allowed to pursue whatever interested us.</p>

<p>Fast forward five years to today and I&#8217;ve started packing a duffel bag for my next trip back to Minnesota. This will be the latest in a slew of trips I have made since moving away from Minnesota nearly six years ago, each and every once of which had something to do with robotics. January fourth will find me on a plane bound first for Atlanta, Georgia, and then back across the nation to Minnesota for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) build season where I will spend two months working alongside a team of twenty-something other high school students to design, build, and program a robot to compete in a challenge that has yet to be released. Unlike my younger years in robotics when I participated in FIRST Lego League we won&#8217;t build with NXTs, beams, and brick separators though, but instead using steel, a drill press, and a 3D printer to name just three of the myriad tools we will use throughout the season. The materials have changed and I have grown, but at the heart of this experience is the desire all those rockets and long afternoons spent programming at the community center instilled within me: that insatiable desire to be a geek&#160;&#8212;&#160;to open my computer and spend some time programming so that I can watch the robot execute my commands with inhuman precision, and still fail; to sketch a diagram on a whiteboard, build and tweak it digitally with CAD, and have a 3D printer print any parts I can&#8217;t walk across the machine shop to build. And that&#8217;s all thanks to the way I was brought up, thanks to the things I was allowed to do; it&#8217;s thanks to all the things I wasn&#8217;t told I couldn&#8217;t do that I&#8217;m going to step on to a plane in a week and leave my home for two months to transform a pile of metal and a few thousand lines of code into a functioning robot. It&#8217;s thanks to all those things that I&#8217;m going to do that and absolutely <em>love</em> it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as time marches on fewer and fewer of those things are okay to do. We launched rockets out of potato cannon tubes when we ran out of potatoes just to see what would happen. Sure, we can and will probably do that again in the coming weeks, but how much longer will that be okay? John Biggs, the author of the article that brought me to this rant <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/27/in-praise-of-dangerous-toys/"><em>In Praise of Dangerous Toys</em></a>, played with potassium nitrate, sulphur, and charcoal when he was a kid; today everything in a science kit has to be edible. I didn&#8217;t play with potassium nitrate when I was growing up, but some of the substances were not too distant cousins of the concoction John made in his basement while his dad read the paper. And we all turned out okay: John&#8217;s generation grew up to produce some of the greatest minds of the century, and I&#8217;m about to spend two months having the time of my life doing what I love, doing what I&#8217;ve been brought up to do.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-12-26 20:00:33-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-12.html">12</a>/26 20:00:33 EST</time>
<p>As I was working through my seemingly immutable Instapaper queue this morning I came across Jason Snell&#8217;s article from earlier this month titled <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2018600/why-im-writing-on-the-ipad.html"><em>Writing on the iPad</em></a>; it was as if I had written the article myself.</p>

<p>Over the past six months I made it a point to keep a journal. Not so that I could reflect on my feelings twenty years from now, but so that I could give it to someone very dear to me as a Christmas gift. Rather than keep the journal on my computer as I would have preferred to with any sort of activity requiring me to write extensively though, I chose to forsake the immutability digitality affords and put pen to paper to create something inherently more valuable than it would have been as a collection of text files printed on 8.5x11 paper. Although my handwriting, just as Jason Snell&#8217;s, was then and still is&#160;&#8212;&#160;although to a lesser degree now&#160;&#8212;&#160;quite poor, I was very happy with the result. As was she.</p>

<p>That creation process was surprisingly different than any I had employed in the past, and consequentially the result was markedly different than anything I had previously created. Whereas when I write with the intention of publicizing to this and its derivative platforms I edit fastidiously, I found that I spent little to no time editing my journal entries. Not because I was lazy or cared less about the quality of the result, but instead because I didn&#8217;t <em>need</em> to edit them: unlike when I write on my computer and&#160;&#8212;&#160;although to a lesser degree&#160;&#8212;&#160;my iPad, where I often write very quickly and spend an inordinate amount of time editing, the constraints writing with a pen and paper introduce forced me to consider each and every word very carefully. This made that writing especially good; in fact, I might even go so far as to say it was some of the best writing I have done in a long time. Although writing on my iPad does bring with it a similar set of benefits, the unique set of constraints the pen and paper approach presents exhibits these quality traits most prominently. These realizations brought me to a particularly interesting and counter-intuitive conclusion I plan to explore in the coming weeks: it is in the presence of great constraints that great achievements are accomplished.</p>

<p>The other day I wrote a short, single paragraph post titled <em>Christmas Break</em>. The gist of the very short article was to say that it&#8217;s okay to take a break from working, that your holiday break shouldn&#8217;t necessarily be spent catching up on overdue work; taking a break is not a bad thing, and in the grand scheme of things is unlikely to negatively impact your future success. I released the article early in the afternoon of Christmas Eve without any expectation that it would attract any meaningful traffic, but nevertheless submitted it to Hacker News. When I happened to check my stats the next morning, I was surprised to find that it had attracted nearly 220 pageviews over eleven hours. Christmas Day saw another forty visits, totaling to around 260 within the first two days.</p>

<p>Of those 260 visitors though, not even 2<code> were people who had been to my website before, people that were coming back to read that article. Not even 2</code>. This got my thinking, and eventually prompted me to write this short observation: attracting visitors is no longer difficult. The advent of sites like Hacker News, Reddit, Digg, and other aggregators make exposing good work to a wide audience very easy, and the prevalence of the linkblog format has made it very easy for relatively obscure writers to have their work thrust into the glow cast off a passing fireball&#160;&#8212;&#160;a daring fireball, to be exact&#160;&#8212;&#160;or shrouded in the shadow of a wily beard as the case may be. Rather, it is in developing a consistent readership that the enormous challenge facing fledgling internet writers lies, and it is in pursuit of this goal that so many fledgling writers become discouraged and, eventually, forsake the writer&#8217;s craft. Since starting this website almost a month ago I have managed to turn nearly 8% of my traffic into returning readers; some will have much greater success than this, and some will experience much less. As for me, that&#8217;s a number I can live with for now; in the future I hope to gradually increase the number of digits, but for now, I am satisfied with my results.</p>

<p>So keep in mind, when you scroll through your site&#8217;s analytics, that those model writers&#160;&#8212;&#160;the ones you follow every day and strive to emulate both in success and in ability&#160;&#8212;&#160;have been doing this much longer than you. Jim Dalrymple has been writing for <em>longer than I have been alive</em>. Rome was not built in a day, and neither will a consistent readership be built over the same period. Keep that in mind, and get back to writing.</p>

<p>The tendency to choose the path of least resistance has always been one of the most annoying personality traits I possess. Often manifested as a calm, easygoing attitude it has, however, served me quite well over the years. A double-edged sword if ever there was a more appropriate time to use the phrase, on the one hand the ability to discern and choose the course of action most agreeable to the largest number of dissidents has proven extremely useful; in combination with the easygoing attitude this approach prompts, I have been able to avoid unnecessary stress more times than I can remember, and for that I am thankful. On the other hand though, I often find myself backing down from an argument in favor of a different solution to the disagreement where in all actuality, a fight would have been the most appropriate response. That&#8217;s when the likeable, everyman attitude becomes problematic: when it becomes the driving force behind the tendency to not fight for the things you believe in, whether those &#8220;things&#8221; are something so simple as the place for dinner or something possibly infinitely more complex such as an opinion. As writers on the internet who are exposed to criticism of the latter much more often than the former of the two, it&#8217;s important to stick to your guns, to not balk in the face of adversity; for on the internet ambivalence is perceived as weakness, and just as in nature, weakness will be brutally stamped out.</p>

And then I came across Ben Brooks&#8217;s quote of the day for Christmas 2012. And then I sat down to do the thing I&#8217;ve managed to avoid doing since starting Christmas break: I sat down to write.</p>

<p>Since starting Christmas Break a few days ago I&#8217;ve had a lot of time on my hands. I intended to spend a lot of this time catching up on some reading, writing, coding, and working on a new project, but unfortunately as of yet that hasn&#8217;t happened. During what relatively little reading I did do over the three days since Christmas Break started though, I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m not the only one to step back, take a bit of a break from working, and relax. And you know what? That&#8217;s just fine: you don&#8217;t have to spend every day working, nor are you required to make up for lost time over holidays. You will still be successful if you take a bit of a break. It&#8217;s Christmas; go relax on the couch, eat some cookies, and gain a few pounds.</p>

</h2>
<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-12-13 15:55:41-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-12.html">12</a>/13 15:55:41 EST</time>
<p>As I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/meet-the-oatmeal.html"><em>BuzzFeed, Meet The Oatmeal</em></a> Tuesday night, I came across <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/12/instacast-3/">Shawn Blanc&#8217;s short post</a> regarding Vemedio&#8217;s latest release in a bout of procrastination as I pursued Twitter. My excitement over a new major release of my favorite podcast client was tinged with confusion though as I attempted to update the app, and was instead presented with the option to purchase it once again. Curious, I began digging around until finally, after a strangely complicated search, I confirmed my suspicion that Instacast 3.0 is, in fact, a paid upgrade.</p>

<p>At first I intended only to publish a short acknowledgment article as Shawn posted; however, after writing the article, as I sat back and looked at it, I realized the release of Instacast 3 was not only a perfect opportunity to discuss the latest iteration of my favorite podcatcher, but could also serve as my jumping-off point to discussing a number of topics related to app pricing. Unable to pass this opportunity by, I put off publishing this article for another day so as to give myself time to craft something worthwhile to say.</p>

<p>Since releasing Instacast 3.0, the <a href="http://www.imore.com/instacast-30-iphone-and-ipad-now-available">widespread</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/instacast-3-review/">positive</a> <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/instacast-3/">responses</a> across the web have been undercut by negative undertones, especially in the form of app reviews. Beginning with 1.0, Vemedio has continued searching for a solution to the problem of recurring app revenue with each major release: the first version sold for $2.99; Instacast HD, an iteration of the popular podcatcher for the iPad released shortly after Instacast 1.4, sold for $4.99. With Instacast 2.0, a paid upgrade from the previous version, Vemedio changed the base price to $0.99 in an attempt at attracting a wider audience with the lower price point, supplemented by a $1.99 in-app purchase for what were marketed as pro features. Instacast HD went unaffected by this shift in price point. The release of Instacast 3.0 removed this segmentation and not only brought a universal app to market where previously there existed two separate binaries, but also boasted a multitude of interface, user experience, and performance improvements in addition to fixing the long-standing iCloud syncing issue as well as finalizing Instacast&#8217;s pricing model at $4.99. As stated in <a href="http://vemedio.com/blog/posts/instacast-3-0-available">the blog post announcing its release</a>, Instacast 3 truly is &#8220;in many ways a whole new app.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite all these major improvements&#160;&#8212;&#160;and there should be no doubt that use of modern technologies to greatly improve Instacast&#8217;s responsiveness and cross-device <a href="http://vemedio.com/blog/posts/more-about-our-cloud-sync">syncing capabilities</a> <em>are</em> major improvements&#160;&#8212;&#160;complaints at having to pay for the new upgrade are in no short supply, nor is this the first time these complaints have surfaced: after Instacast 2.0 was released as a paid upgrade earlier this year, Vemedio experienced a similar level of backlash. Even as <a href="http://www.macgasm.net/2012/05/21/instacasts-upgrade-makes-some-users-pay-twice/">some</a> users complained though, <a href="http://curiousrat.com/2012/5/8/pick-your-upgrade-battles.html">many</a> saw the new model for what it was: a developer trying to support the ongoing improvement of a beloved app in an ecosystem non-conducive to any form of recurring app revenue.</p>

<p>Over the years Apple has continued to lobby for&#160;&#8212;&#160;inadvertently or otherwise, it is hard to say&#160;&#8212;&#160;a largely unsustainable app revenue system in which developers are paid increasingly smaller amounts in exchange for the fruits of the labor, and then expected to pour more time and effort into the development of these applications for indefinite time periods without any sort of compensation. In the face of this issue, app developers have handled this in a number of ways. Marco Arment, for example, recoups the day-to-day costs of running Instapaper through <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/subscription">an in-app purchase subscription model</a> where users have the option to pay $3 every three months in exchange for &#8220;almost nothing, except knowing that you are supporting the Instapaper service&#8217;s operation and future feature development.&#8221; Other developers such as Martin Hering, founder of Vemedio and Instacast&#8217;s creator, have instead chosen to charge for app updates by suspending the previous version from sale and releasing the latest iteration as a separate app, thus getting around Apple&#8217;s lack of functionality providing for paid upgrades. Whereas supporting Instapaper is optional, those wishing to receive the latest version of Instacast are forced to purchase the app again. While the recently-announced <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast3/membership">Instacast Memberships</a> will alleviate some of the pressure to charge for each major update, it is unlikely to lower the price point or obfuscate the need to charge for future updates. Contrary to the established model, this approach rubs many people the wrong way.</p>

<p>We have gradually been conditioned to consider paying anything more than $0.99 for any app cause for serious consideration, and that charging for upgrades&#160;&#8212;&#160;regardless of the time and effort put into the release&#160;&#8212;&#160;is ludicrous. This mentality has fostered the unsustainable expectation that a one-time purchase could somehow support the continued improvement of any given app permeating the entire app ecosystem like an infectious disease, one that will slowly stifle and then kill independent innovation. Martin found an apparently successful solution to the problem posed by funding a niche app like Instacast, but yet we complain at having to hand him a few dollars every so often to perpetuate the development of such an excellent service? Martin spent two months building Instacast 1.0; over the next fourteen months in addition to pushing out occasional point releases, he developed Instacast 2.0. Was $0.99, or $2.99 assuming you purchased the pro features, worth fourteen <em>months</em> of his time? Nearly seven months elapsed between the release of Instacast 2.0 and Instacast 3.0, during which Martin continued to improve Instacast 2 while simultaneously rebuilding the entire app from the ground up; is this worth %4.99 to you? He essentially rebuilt the entire app&#160;&#8212;&#160;at what point does an indie developer&#8217;s time become worth more than $0.99?</p>

<p>I find it particularly disturbing that this sort of conversation could even take place among Instacast&#8217;s users, people who, given the niche it occupies, should have at least a basic understand of the extensive time and effort required to bring an app of Instacast&#8217;s caliber to market. Developers like Martin Hering pour their time and effort into applications like Instacast, then ask for less than $5 in compensation. And then we complain because it&#8217;s not $0.99. It&#8217;s asinine: pay to support the developers who create your favorite apps. Rather than writing critical articles and angry tweets because we have the opportunity to&#160;&#8212;&#160;not &#8220;have to&#8221;, &#8220;have the opportunity to&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;pay for the continued development of an app like Instacast, we should instead ask, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I pay <em>more</em>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Last night just before I went to bed I was scrolling through my Twitter stream&#160;&#8212;&#160;as you do&#160;&#8212;&#160;when I came across Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s post titled after a line from Mathew Inman&#8217;s article <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/jack_stuef"><em>Dear Jack Stuef</em></a>, <a href="http://loopu.in/Z7WRiQ">&#8220;You bitter, uninspired, bottom-feeding ass&#8221;</a>. All the more curious once I discovered Jim&#8217;s link was to an article written by one of my favorite webcomic authors, I spent the next half hour reading in varying degrees of disbelief and disappointment&#160;&#8212;&#160;disbelief that the issue managed to escalate this far, and disappointment that Mathew Inman received enough flak to take time out of his life and away from creating his excellent webcomic to respond.</p>

<p>The issue in question regards Inman&#8217;s <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/keyboard">recent comic strip</a>, the last panel of which has since been removed from the website but nevertheless can be found in a <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/10021922384">Democratic Underground forum post</a>, in which Inman humorously explained his &#8220;delicate relationship&#8221; with various keys on his keyboard. In doing so, Inman compared the F5 key to a rape victim in an attempt at humor that although was certainly borderline inappropriate, did not cross any sort of imaginary, not-well-defined line. The rape joke was a poor choice when considered in the 20/20 vision of hindsight, but we&#160;&#8212;&#160;the collective &#8220;we&#8221; of the Internet&#160;&#8212;&#160;should not crucify him for an off-color joke. Unfortunately, this is exactly what Jack Stuef did in his article posted on BuzzFeed titled <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jackstuef/the-secrets-of-the-internets-most-beloved-viral-m">The Secrets of the Internet&#8217;s Most Beloved Viral Marketer</a> where he used the rape joke as his &#8220;<a href="http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/Putting<code>20Yourself</code>20Out%20There.htm">way in</a>&#8221; to tearing apart Mathew Inman himself as well as his work. Laughably inaccurate, as Inman pointed out in <em>Dear Jack Stuef</em>, nevertheless we the internet have climbed up to our lofty pedestal, adjusted our toupee and twirled our handlebar mustache, and begun pontificating to this one man even as with the hand not outstretched in condemnation we retweet Inappropriate Tweets because their latest quip is just oh-so hilarious.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can see how asinine this is. I&#8217;m not excusing the joke, but it&#8217;s important to draw a line between the joke Inman made and portraying him as having said that &#8220;<a href="http://www.blogher.com/rape-jokes-and-oatmeal">rape is no big deal</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.progressiveboink.com/2012/12/4/3727746/the-oatmeal-rape-joke">trivializing something so awful for the sake of puppeting a joke</a>&#8221;, which is simply not the case. And unfortunately, as of this morning it seemed that Mathew Inman was the only one capable of realizing this. When I opened Tweetbot earlier this evening though, a different scene unfolded before me: the discussion has ceased to be permeated by Inman&#8217;s idiot detractors as The Oatmeal&#8217;s more reasonable readers have written actual responses to the issue. Jeff Roberts of GigaOM collected a number of these opinions in his <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/12/11/buzzfeed-apologizes-sort-of-for-smear-of-the-oatmeal-cartoonist">article posted in response to BuzzFeed releasing &#8220;an apology, of sorts&#8221;</a>. Despite claiming to have removed the erroneous portions though, for some reason the article, chock-full of errors and inaccuracies, remains as an apparently permanent stain on BuzzFeed&#8217;s reputation in the minds of the undoubtedly numerous readers who before last night only knew of BuzzFeed as one acknowledges the fact that Yahoo! and RIM still exist.</p>

<p>Beginning with the plagiarism controversy I discussed in <a href="http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/Bullies.htm"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a> and picking back up in the flame war Marco Arment and John Gruber started with Josh Topolsky of The Verge not long afterwards, this debacle marks the third ugly Internet incident I have witnessed in the past few months. Despite being over completely different topics though&#160;&#8212;&#160;how the advent of a particular system in taxi cabs has greatly increased cab drivers&#8217; revenue, properly crediting Apple as the source for the majority of today&#8217;s tech designs, and inappropriate jokes on a webcomic, respectively&#160;&#8212;&#160;these three events do possess one common trait: poor writing. In Joshua Gross&#8217;s case with his article <a href="http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/22958656041/the-144-146-165-button"><em>The $144,146,165 Button</em></a>, a complete lack of principles and editorial oversight resulted in his article ending up on The Next Web nearly verbatim; the attribution argument is not as clear-cut, but simple credit given where it was due would have prevented the entire Arment-Gruber-Topolsky outburst; these past few days have seen a combination of these factors to the worst extent possible: first, we have a writer completely devoid of any principles. See Stuef&#8217;s joke about Sarah Palin&#8217;s son with Down syndrome for proof of that. As if that was not enough, whatever editorial oversight present at BuzzFeed seems to have taken the day off when Stuef&#8217;s article was published. How else could something so blatantly inaccurate, wrong, and stupid ever get out the door? And then the attribution aspect enters the fray in the form of accurate research, which Stuef clearly did anything other than in preparation&#160;&#8212;&#160;what little of which occurred&#160;&#8212;&#160;for the release of his &lt;strike&gt;article&lt;/strike&gt; personal attack, posted on BuzzFeed of all places. Hopefully the third time&#8217;s the charm here and this will be the last time I have the chance to make this sort of comparison again, but I find that woefully doubtful.</p>

<p>I originally intended to close this article with Josh Topolsky&#8217;s final remark aimed at John and Marco, just as I closed <em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em>: &#8220;And that&#8217;s too bad, because I think you both have a lot more to contribute.&#8221; As I thought about it though I realized just how out of place that would have been here: while I do believe Mathew Inman does have a lot more to contribute to the web, I think we can all agree that Jack Stuef has contributed quite enough already.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-12-10 13:36:00-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-12.html">12</a>/10 13:36:00 EST</time>
<p>In my previous article I talked about how I have begun to use my iPad increasingly often as a device to not only consume content, but also to generate it. I mentioned that I read almost every article in Instapaper and that I use Simplenote to write, but I did not delve any deeper into my iPad setup, nor did I go into too much detail in explaining the toolset I employ increasingly infrequently on my computer in the colophon. Taking after <a href="http://daringfireball.net/colophon/">John Gruber</a> and <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/colophon/">Shawn Blanc</a>, these are the tools I use. First, on my iOS devices, as these are the computers I use most often these days. Not necessarily in any particular order,</p>

<ul>
<li>Instapaper - For all my reading and article archival needs, I turn to Marco Arment&#8217;s excellent cross-platform app.</li>
<li>Simplenote - I recently moved all my writing to this app. With instantaneous syncing across all my devices as well as the web, Simplenote allows me to write anywhere with nearly any device.</li>
<li>Feedler - My go-to RSS reader since I bought my first iOS device, Feedler works on both my iPhone and iPad and integrates well with Instapaper and Chrome for iOS.</li>
<li>Tweetbot - Far superior to twitter&#8217;s own iOS client, I use Tweetbot as my primary twitter app. Tweetbot also syncs my timeline position across devices, allowing me to read part of my timeline on one device, then switch over and scroll through the rest on another.</li>
<li>Chrome - I prefer Google&#8217;s browser as opposed to Mobile Safari primarily for its speed and also because it syncs my open tabs across all my devices.</li>
<li>Instacast - Although this is not a writing app, podcasts are often the source of inspiration behind many of my articles and thus this list would not be complete without mentioning what I consider to be the best iOS podcast manager. As with many of the other apps I have mentioned, Instacast syncs current playback position, subscriptions, and unplayed episodes across all my iOS devices.</li>
<li>Dropbox - I store all my personal documents, with the exception of pictures and videos, in Dropbox, providing me access to all of my files virtually anywhere.</li>
<li>Nocs - An excellent app for viewing and editing any text-based file stored in Dropbox, and the app I used to write in prior to Simplenote.</li>
<li>Byword - Prior to Nocs, Byword was my go-to writing app. Supporting Markdown and several extended functions, Byword is an excellent writing app.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this list demonstrates, syncing across devices and across platforms is a headlining feature for me: it not only provides data security as my work is not stored on any one device, but also allows me to start a podcast on my iPhone as I read an article in Instapaper and jot down some notes in Simplenote, and then transition to my iPad where I can resume playing that podcast, finish reading that article, and expand those notes into a full-fledged blog post.</p>

<p>I choose my desktop apps based on their ability to integrate with my iOS devices. Unfortunately, on a PC this does not leave me with very many options, and even fewer <em>good</em> options. These are the tools I have found to be superior for accomplishing their core competency on the PC.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome - Chrome is easily the most used program on my computer: not only does it sync open tabs with my iOS devices, I also use it to read Instapaper articles on the rare occasion that I read on my computer rather than my iPad. I can also write in Chrome as a last resort thanks to both Simplenote and Dropbox&#8217;s web-syncing counterparts.</li>
<li>Sublime Text - My favorite text editor, I use Sublime Text to write blog article as well as program. I hope to write about Sublime Text in the near future, so I will forgo any sort of in-depth explanation at this point. I will, however, say this: of all the text editors I have ever tried and especially amongst those available for the PC, Sublime Text is by far the superior program not only in speed, but also in functionality and ease of use.</li>
<li>ResophNotes - An excellent Simplenote app for Windows, ResophNotes allows me to pick up where I left off writing should I feel the need to finish on my computer. With excellent cross-platform syncing capabilities and support for Markdown, ResophNotes is by far the best desktop Simplenote app on the market.</li>
<li>Dropbox - Again, I sync all my personal documents in Dropbox. In addition to granting access to all my files across all my devices, Dropbox also provides an excellent backup solution as well as versioning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The length of these two lists brings up an interesting point resulting from the fact that I use more apps to accomplish arguably the same tasks on my iOS devices as compared to the number of programs I employ on my desktop machine, a point that the iPad&#8217;s detractors often use against it: due to the very nature of the iPad, on average a greater number of apps are required in order to accomplish the same task than on traditional computers. I don&#8217;t see this as a an unfortunate result of an overbearing system though, but rather the fortunate cause behind a number of the great apps both geeks and &#8220;the normals&#8221;, as Marco said on the second episode of Build &#38; Analyze, enjoy the use of today: while the App Store does not prevent developers from building the multi-purpose catch-all programs popular on the PC and, although to a lesser extent, the Mac, it does encourage app makers to focus on their core competency, resulting in more apps that are better at solving smaller sets of problems rather than fewer apps that possess the ability to solve a greater range of problems in a lesser manner.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-12-08 20:41:27-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-12.html">12</a>/08 20:41:27 EST</time>
<p>Over the past two weeks my usage of the iPad as a device for both content consumption and creation has exploded: whereas before I had used the iPad primarily to read textbooks with the occasional deviation into other forms of reading, I now use the iPad as my primary computing device. Despite the occasional inconvenience this approach presents, forcing me to return to my computer for one thing or another from time to time, I have done so less often than I thought I would, and it happens increasingly infrequently as I spend more time perfecting a new workflow. And that&#8217;s strange for me, as an avid programmer, writer, and occasional gamer, to discover.</p>

<p>I have always thought of the iPad as a content consumption device rather than a device that could be used for content creation. In light of that opinion, I used my iPad to read textbooks, as I mentioned earlier, but even more so to time-shift my reading with Instapaper. Even though I used Instapaper frequently in the past, over the last two weeks I have employed the service increasingly often as the conduit through which I send nearly every article I wish to read, as well as the service I use to permanently archive all the articles I find exceptional in one way or another. Combined with Simplenote, these two apps gave me the the ability to both consume and produce content whether I&#8217;m using my iPad, iPhone, or any other device equipped with an Internet connection and a capable browser. Sorry Internet Explorer. And I can&#8217;t stress how weird this&#160;&#8212;&#160;forsaking a computer that is in almost every aspect superior, at least technically, for the iPad&#160;&#8212;&#160;is for me.</p>

<p>My point in this article is not to poke fun at Internet Explorer though, or to talk about my feelings as if this were a self-help gathering, but instead to say this: amidst <a href="http://technologizer.com/2011/12/05/how-the-ipad-2-became-my-favorite-computer/">the</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/ipad-creation/">great</a> <a href="http://geeqer.com/2012/06/ipad-creation/">debate</a> a few months ago where <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/06/25/peter-ha-came-so-close/">the Internet</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/11/ipad-content-creation">buzzed</a> with the discussion&#160;&#8212;&#160;or argument, as the case more often was&#160;&#8212;&#160;of whether the iPad was a correctly positioned as a device for creating content, or if it would forever be relegated to the simple task of consuming content made in more powerful computers, I came down on the latter side of the argument; but recently, I&#8217;ve become a convert. Today I&#8217;m more likely to wake up, roll out of my bed, and grab my iPad instead of turning my computer on; I don&#8217;t sit in front of my computer browsing news feeds, clearing my Instapaper queue, checking twitter, and disdaining Facebook as I eat breakfast, I do all that from my iPad; and when it comes time to write, I don&#8217;t open my laptop&#8217;s lid anymore, I flip the Smart Cover open.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-12-06 09:08:35-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-12.html">12</a>/06 09:08:35 EST</time>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that everyone has a link blog these days, and there is no short supply of <a href="http://behindcompanies.com/2012/08/the-linkblog-cancer/">opinions</a> on <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/09/linkblogs">this</a> <a href="http://alexarena.com/the-cure-to-the-linkblog-cancer/">topic</a>, arguing both for and against the widespread use of the format <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/linked_list">John Gruber introduced in 2004</a>. I am not here to parrot the words of other bloggers though, but to instead offer a solution to what Marcelo Sommers dubbed &#8220;the linkblog cancer&#8221;.</p>

<p>As popularized primarily by John Gruber and to a lesser degree other writers who have adopted his proven format over the years, the linkblog strategy prescribes the title as a link to the cited article, a paragraph excerpt, and some form of commentary. There exist a few variations to this strategy, but by and large few bloggers stray from this path. In preparation for the launch of this blog I decided that while I did want to implement this format to a certain degree, I also wanted to find some way to differentiate myself from the myriad other bloggers writing this way. The result of that desire was the nuance variation on John&#8217;s posting scheme I use today. And while I admit it is a very subtle difference, I nevertheless believe it is an important one.</p>

<p>When I make a linked-list post, I attempt to differentiate myself on the manner of commentary I provide. When I link to a news story my commentary is an analysis, and op-ed pieces are posted alongside my own opinions of the matter. I don&#8217;t try to be John Gruber and post with witty title and clever tagline; instead, I choose to give my readers the one thing they won&#8217;t find on The Loop or hear from Shawn Blanc, to add something to the conversation not present anywhere else on the internet: my opinion. And if that opinions turns out to be not quite as unique as I thought, well, that means I&#8217;m posting one less article today.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-12-03 11:45:31-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-12.html">12</a>/03 11:45:31 EST</time>
<p>Earlier this morning <a href="http://nicharalambous.com/">Nic Haralambous</a> posted an article titled <a href="http://nicharalambous.com/2012/12/03/dont-read-techcrunch/"><em>Don&#8217;t Read TechCrunch</em></a>. Within four hours his article had climbed to the #1 spot on the Hacker News home page with 132 points, at which point I found it and, out of curiosity, clicked the link.</p>

<p>The succinct point Nic made in <em>Don&#8217;t Read TechCrunch</em> was this: rather than spend time reading articles about fund raising, greater benefit to both him and his company came as a result of him focusing on building a profitable business. In closing Nic advised against reading TechCrunch in particular, citing it as &#8220;the biggest culprit&#8221; in a space &#8220;glorifying money raising.&#8221; While I do agree with the conclusion Nic came to in his article, his conclusion only scratches the surface of a much broader problem. The problem does not lie in wrongly glorifying a certain aspect of business, for as Nic admitted in his article, &#8220;It&#8217;s a much more complicated and in depth process in Africa and South Africa to raise funding&#8221;. Rather, the problem resides in the inherently fallacious mentality that simply reading can ever take the place of actually working towards a goal, whether that goal is developing a more profitable business or furthering your abilities as a writer.</p>

<p>Thanks to the magic that is Instapaper, I was able to reference the original text of Josh Topolsky&#8217;s article <a href="http://joshuatopolsky.com/post/31285353423/integrity-and-bullies-with-blogs"><em>Integrity and Bullies with Blogs</em></a> rather than the updated version available on his Tumblr blog, although my efforts proved to be for naught when I found the only difference between the two version to be the removal of a single sentence in the opening paragraph. Despite this I do not regret spending the extra ten minutes it took to locate a device equipped with Instapaper that had not synced with the Instapaper servers since I moved the article to the Archive folder&#160;&#8212;&#160;an action that removes the local cache in favor of a link to the article&#8217;s source&#160;&#8212;&#160;and install a Sublime Text plugin to diff the two copies of Josh&#8217;s article. I don&#8217;t regret what turned out to be an unnecessary expenditure of a minimal amount of time and effort for two reasons, the first of which is that in doing so I obtained the tools necessary to perform this task for future articles where it might be of greater importance. More importantly though, because taking an extra few minutes to verify the validity of my premise and formulate my thoughts into cohesive points is a step I believe every writer and especially those involved in this debacle could learn from.</p>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>In the hopes that following this exchange might be made slightly easier by its inclusion, I have provided a list of the articles related to this spectacle below, ordered chronologically:</p>

<ul>
<li>November 29: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/29/3276599/samsung-series-5-series-7-slate-windows-8"><em>Samsung Series 5 and 7 Slates: one part tablet, one part laptop, all Windows 8</em></a> by David Pierce on The Verge.</li>

<li>September 10: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/10/hp-spectre-one-all-in-one-envy-20-envy-23-pavilion-20/"><em>HP announces Spectre One desktop, three other all-in-ones</em></a> on Engadget.</li>
<li>September 10: <a href="http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/9/10/hp-spectre-one-desktop.html"><em>HP Spectre One Desktop</em></a>; The piece Marco linked to in the title of his article below, where Harry Marks complained about, among other things, Engadget&#8217;s failure to mention the similarities between HP&#8217;s Spectre One desktop and the iMac.</li>
<li>September 10: <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/09/10/elephant"><em>Harry Marks on Engadget&#8217;s coverage of the HP iMac</em></a>; Marco&#8217;s post criticizing Engadget and The Verge for failing to mention the &#8220;HP Spectre One&#8217;s many obvious similarities to the iMac&#8221;, where he went on to theorize as to possible motivations behind this oversight.</li>
<li>September 10: <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/09/reporting-kind-of/"><em>Reporting</em></a>; Ben Brooks commenting on the controversy up to this point. His article was published shortly before Josh posted his piece on the issue, after which Ben revisited the topic.</li>

And rightfully so, with a title such as this one that so accurately conveys The Verge, Engadget, and in particular Josh Topolsky&#8217;s opinion at this point.</li>
</ul>

<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />

<p>The flame war began with John Gruber&#8217;s trademark link-and-commentary-style article <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/30/samsung"><em>Samsung Series 5 and 7 Slates Ring a Bell</em></a>, during which John, in characteristic Daring Fireball fashion, quipped in response to The Verge&#8217;s article reviewing the Samsung Series 5 and 7 slate: &#8220;Who has less integrity: Samsung for &#8216;designing&#8217; this, or The Verge for pretending it&#8217;s legitimate?&#8221; Given the frequency of the blatant and unabashed theft of Apple&#8217;s designs by its competitors, this controversy could have erupted at any time over the last year, but over the past few months especially; it was by some stroke of luck that it began here. John then handed the torch off to Marco, who readily took up the cause in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/09/10/elephant"><em>Harry Marks on Engadget&#8217;s coverage of the HP iMac</em></a>. Marco commented on Engadget and The Verge&#8217;s recent coverage of HP&#8217;s new Spectre desktop lineup, agreeing with Harry Marks&#8217; complaint that the big gadget blogs were leaving out a crucial fact from these stories: the obvious mimicry of Apple&#8217;s designs. Not long after Marco published this observation, Josh came out swinging in the first paragraph of a new article titled <a href="http://joshuatopolsky.com/post/31285353423/integrity-and-bullies-with-blogs"><em>Integrity and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>. Ben Brooks did an excellent job dissecting Josh&#8217;s article in his piece also titled <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/09/oh-jesus/"><em>Integrity and Bullies with Blogs</em></a> though, so I will forgo that step and cut to my take on the situation:</p>

<p>While I do believe both the writers at Engadget and those at The Verge were wrong to exclude even a passing mention of the obvious similarities of both HP and Samsung&#8217;s designs to Apple&#8217;s, I feel John and Marco&#8217;s criticism of the two firms was overly harsh&#160;&#8212;&#160;not unwarranted, simply overly harsh. On this issue I at least partially agree with Josh. I do not, however, agree with the manner through which he conveyed that sentiment, nor do I find his supporting &#8220;arguments&#8221;, if they could even be called that, particularly attractive, especially of such a prominent writer. Ben Brooks destroys a few of them in his previously-cited article, which I recommend everyone read.</p>

<p>Out of of all this I believe a number of very important lesson can be learned, foremost of which is that writing in anger&#160;&#8212;&#160;as Josh Topolsky obviously did&#160;&#8212;&#160;serves two purposes: first, doing so will invariably result in some decrease in credibility among your readers just as Josh&#8217;s credibility went down in my mind after reading his article. Anger is an ugly emotion, one that should be guided with a steady hand; by and large, it has little purpose in writing, especially among those considered to be exceptional writers. Writing in anger will also cloud your judgment and blind you to anything but your own opinion on the matter, just as it did Zee Kane, the CEO of The Next Web, in the plagiarism debacle a few months ago. For those unfamiliar with the matter, Joshua Gross posted an interesting article titled <a href="http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/22958656041/the-144-146-165-button"><em>The $144,146,165 Button</em></a> on May 13th; May 14th found <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2012/05/14/how-3-simple-buttons-raised-tipping-by-144-million-in-nyc-cabs/">a version of his article</a>, without any attribution, on The Next Web. Perhaps most disturbingly the article&#8217;s author Harrison Webber took, at times, content from the original article <em>verbatim</em>, again without any sort of attribution. Joshua Gross&#8217; article <a href="http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/23049725899/plagiarism"><em>Plagiarism</em></a> chronicles the controversy, including Zee&#8217;s heated response to Joshua&#8217;s truthful allegations that one of The Next Web&#8217;s authors had plagiarized his article. Again we find a &#8220;big-shot&#8221;, full-of-himself &#8220;writer&#8221; responding defensively to what turned out to be a perfectly justifiable criticism. Zee Kane, much like Josh Topolsky, responded while his judgment was clouded in anger. In his apology posted as a public Google Doc, Kane concluded with an acknowledgment&#160;&#8212;&#160;however insincere it may have been&#160;&#8212;&#160;that Josh Topolsky could nevertheless take notes from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Lesson learnt? Don&#8217;t respond while emotions are running high - I even had strict rules on this, yet still did. Secondly, seriously keep my mouth shut until I know all the facts. Even when I&#8217;m sure I know them, check again.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final lesson here lies in the far-reaching effects this plagiarism fiasco had on the overall perception of The Next Web in many people&#8217;s minds. Take, for example, a tweet quoted in The Daily Dot&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/the-next-web-zee-kane-apology/"><em>The Next Web Apologizes to Plagiarized Blogger</em></a> from Scott Knauer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;@endtwist @gruber Thanks for bringing this to light. I was going to unsubscribe from TNW, but fortunately I had previously. @Zee scumbag&#8221;</p>

<p>This feeling closely mirrors mine and reflects the general disgust felt by <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/05/15/plagiarism-doesnt-work.html">many</a> other <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/14/next-web-dirtbaggery">prominent</a> <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/05/14/plagiarism-and-the-next-web/">bloggers</a> who were greatly dismayed that this even happened, and then further disappointed in the manner by which it was handled. Although Rob Beschizza, John Gruber, and Jim Dalrymple&#160;&#8212;&#160;the authors of the three aforementioned articles, respectively&#160;&#8212;&#160;likely did not cease to use The Next Web as a viable news source, to this day I refuse to use The Next Web. I have associated The Next Web with plagiarism, rash outbursts, and poor choices; as Rob Beschizza said in his article describing the situation, &#8220;A writer at The Next Web copied a post from a relatively unknown blogger and got caught&#8221;, and this is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Just as the dispute between The Next Web and Joshua Gross cast some aspersions on The Next Web, the strife between The Verge and Engadget and Marco Arment, John Gruber, Ben Brooks, and many other internet writers undoubtedly also cast the two parties on the defensive in a negative light. This is likely why Josh Topolsky responded so vehemently in a situation that should have been handled in a very different manner, and for that I believe he does deserve some level of pardon for his outburst. That said though, any perceived damage to his brand still does not justify the sweeping generalizations Josh made, many of which Ben Brooks addressed in his piece appropriately published with the the same title.</p>

<p>So write and be sure to give credit where credit is due. Had The Verge and Engadget&#8217;s staff even attempted to give Apple credit where credit was so obviously due, this would have never happened. Similarly, all Joshua Gross asked for was credit for the work he had done; a simple link would have sufficed. It was not to be though, and from there the situation deteriorated quickly and resulted in bad publicity for The Verge, Engadget, and The Next Web alike. These are lessons both aspiring and established writers can and should learn from but often fail to. As Josh said by way of concluding his article, &#8220;And that&#8217;s too bad, because I think you both have a lot more to contribute.&#8221;</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-11-28 15:04:27-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-11.html">11</a>/28 15:04:27 EST</time>
<p>When Marco Arment released <a href="http://the-magazine.org">The Magazine</a> in early October, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/10/11/the-magazine">the announcement</a> attracted the attention of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/11/the-magazine">many</a> <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/10/11/the-magazine/">prominent</a> <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/10/the-magazine/">internet</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/10/the-magazine/">writers</a>, all of which spoke very enthusiastically about Marco&#8217;s magazine initiative. A biweekly publication released through iOS&#8217;s Newsstand, The Magazine featured articles from Guy English, Jason Snell, Alex Payne, and Michael Lopp in just <a href="http://the-magazine.org/1">the first issue</a>. <a href="http://the-magazine.org/2">The second issue</a> attracted work from John Siracusa, Lex Friedman, and Gina Trapani, setting a precedent I believe Marco will be able to meet with each edition as many other excellent writers contribute their time and efforts to this publication.</p>

<p>In consideration of The Magazine&#8217;s impressive list of contributors, I began contemplating the manner through which the articles I have written will reach an audience. Although as I wrote this article I have spent roughly a year designing a website and building a content management system, they never will. This realization coupled with the extensive publicity surrounding The Magazine&#8217;s release combined to form the audacious thought that I could use The Magazine as a publishing medium rather than starting my own blog, allowing me to skip over the extensive time and effort required to attract any meaningful attention to a newly-established website in addition to many of the other difficult tasks facing fledgling internet writers. Along with the possible benefits of this strategy came a sobering realization that, while I now know to be incorrect, I still believe to be relevant: the gap between the attention afforded a newly published blog such as the one this article would eventually end up on and the fame required for consideration in a publication such as The Magazine is a yawning, massive chasm with but one rickety bridge stretching across. This bridge, to carry the metaphor too far, is one built on hard work and held together with determination and resolve and&#160;&#8212;&#160;yes, Merlin&#160;&#8212;&#160;grit. And just as there is no shortcut to building a sturdy bridge, there is no shortcut to the sort of success the likes of John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple enjoy. Rather, the only solution is to write often and to write well about interesting topics in an interesting way in the hopes that a meaningful number of people will carve time and attention out of their lives for you to occupy, for that is the one finite resource we are all competing for.</p>

<p>Again, the premise&#160;&#8212;&#160;that Marco only considers articles from established writers for publication in The Magazine&#160;&#8212;&#160;is incorrect. When I began writing this article following The Magazine&#8217;s release, Marco had published little information regarding The Magazine. Given the fame of the first four authors though, I came to the premature conclusion that Marco only published articles written by established authors. Marco disproved this theory in his post <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/10/11/the-magazine-faq"><em>The Magazine Launch Day FAQ</em></a> and again on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/99">episode #99</a> of his podcast Build &#38; Analyze though, explicitly stating that he welcomes submissions and article pitches from anyone. Rather than abandon this article though, I chose to rework it to reflect this newfound knowledge without discarding any of the thoughts I had already formulated on the topic.</p>

<p>Although I am not an established writer, I believe my literally unique&#160;&#8212;&#160;Josh&#160;&#8212;&#160;situation gives me an interesting point of view to approach writing from: as an admittedly inexperienced writer trying to make his way in an industry crowded by giants of the space, I am presented with an interesting set of challenges: I must not only show that I am a competent writer, but I must also establish that my opinions are worth reading. Furthermore&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this is arguably the most important task I must accomplish&#160;&#8212;&#160;in order to attain any substantial level of success in this space, I must also demonstrate that my writing is worth reading over the work of writers who have already proved their works as worthy of the time and attention required to appreciate them. For each and every writer is vying for a single, finite resource: the time and attention of our readers. These challenges are not unique to my situation, but common to each and every writer attempting to make it on the internet. This hopefully interesting point of view is my &#8220;way in&#8221; to this topic, the lens through which I will examine the causality of success in this space.</p>

<p>The concept of writing with a &#8220;way in&#8221; fascinated me as the strikingly obvious solution to the difficult problem of setting myself apart from other writers when John Siracusa introduced it on the twenty-third episode of Hypercritical, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/23"><em>No Sentence Left Behind</em></a>. The idea being that one must approach each topic in a unique way with a unique opinion in order to produce something worth reading, I immediately adopted this practice. In exchange for introducing another source of procrastination as I put off writing for another day in search of that interesting opinion to write about, this approach allowed my writing to reflect one of the most important facets of a successful literary career: a unique point of view, the way in which I can separate myself from the hundreds of thousands of other writers trying to make their way on the internet even as I write this sentence.</p>

<p>To illustrate the importance of this concept, simply consider the reason John Gruber is so successful in this space: John writes about interesting opinions in a unique way, and as a result he has become one of the most prominent internet writers since the advent of this medium. By the same token Jim Dalrymple has sustained an upward trend in popularity partially due to the growing success of his podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/amplified">Amplified</a>, but also due to the interesting opinions he conveys quite colorfully on his website <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/">The Loop</a>. In each case the defining traits setting these very successful writers apart is the originality of their opinions and the interesting way in which those opinions are conveyed. The ability to write about interesting topics in an interesting way is not exclusive to these two writers, but a trait each and every established writer has in common. In order to compete against these writers, then, this is a very important skill to possess; however, it is by no means the only necessary talent. Rather, the ability to formulate and convey unique opinions in a unique way is simply a portion of the pie representing the skill set of successful writers. Adjacent to this piece is the ability to convey those opinions well, a talent precious few writers possess.</p>

<p>The road to becoming a good writer is a long and difficult one. Narrow at times and wide at others; occasionally a downhill coast, but more often than not a seemingly never-ending trudge up a mountain. As many aspiring writers quickly learn, there is no shortcut to learning to write well. Just as it would be impossible to build an elevator out of a thousand &#8220;How-To&#8221; books on writing in the real world, these books will not magically form one in this increasingly stretched metaphor. The only way to reach the top of this mountain is to climb it one step at a time. In the terms of this metaphor, the only way to become a better writer is not by consuming a hundred or even a thousand articles and books attempting to teach writing, but simply by sitting down and beginning to write. As counter-intuitive as that may seem, having spent nearly half a decade writing in various capacities, this is the realization I have come to know.</p>

<p>Formulating interesting opinions about interesting topics and writing about those unique opinions well&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is what it means to be a good writer. Only after attaining those skills does it become possible to compete with the giants of this space, for that is writing on the internet: a competition against established writers for the limited time and attention of each and every potential reader. No matter how good I become at writing, I will always feel a slight tug of apprehension each time I publish an article as I once again put myself out there in competition with the writers who have already &#8220;made it&#8221; on the internet, against the writers who affirm mastery over the writer&#8217;s craft and lay claim to the time and attention of an established readership cultivated through years of hard work and effort; the ones who, with few notable exceptions, have both watched and worked to evolve this space over the years; these are the ones aspiring writers must ultimately compete with, and the ones I am up against.</p>

<p>Absolutely hilarious.

<p>The controversial touchdown during the third quarter of this afternoon&#8217;s Houston-Detroit football game left me shaking my head for the rest of the day. Marc Sessler summed it up perfectly in his article <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000099065/article/justin-forsett-houston-texans-gifted-a-touchdown"><em>Justin Forsett, Houston Texans gifted a touchdown</em></a>: the Texans certainly were gifted a touchdown, and unfortunately that touchdown gave them the edge they needed to beat Detroit in overtime.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/were-live.html">We&#8217;re Live</a>, I wrote a slick content management system designed to streamline the publication of my content to the web. Serving as a nod of acknowledgment to Marco Arment&#8217;s efforts in developing his very own CMS dubbed Second Crack, I call my system First Crack. In this post I will talk about why I chose to write my own content management system instead of using an existing engine&#160;&#8212;&#160;a topic that will stretch to encompass a discussion of the advantages such an approach affords&#160;&#8212;&#160;before going through some of the specific aspects of First Crack I find particularly interesting.</p>

<p>The underlying motivation behind writing my own blogging engine rather than using an online host such as WordPress.com or an existing CMS such as Joomla stemmed from my previous experiences with each different type of service. Over the years I have tried virtually every online hosting solution, from Xanga to WordPress.com to Squarespace and everything in between. In each case I ran into the same problem though: a lack of control. At Xanga, to use an example from my early days writing on the internet, customizing a site entailed choosing between various built-in themes and minor CSS modification. Needless to say, such a &#8220;solution&#8221; did not suffice for long. After some research, I eventually moved to Freewebs.com. Now known simply as &#8220;Webs&#8221;, Freewebs&#8217; controls offered greater granularity than any service I had used in the past, but still did not meet my requirements for control and fell short in other key areas. A few months passed before I discovered WordPress.com, where I hosted several blogs during the next four or five years. With hundreds of themes, a relatively customizable layout, and lots of nifty, configurable widgets, WordPress.com&#160;&#8212;&#160;not to be confused with WordPress.org&#160;&#8212;&#160;satisfied my desire for control for quite some time. However, I eventually grew tired of the service and, as I could find no suitable alternative, took a sabbatical from blogging. This break lasted almost a year, during which I learned of Squarespace. At first, Squarespace seemed the perfect service: matching WordPress.com feature for feature, offering complete site customization, and possessing the intangible that brought me back time after time, I registered a blog and began customizing the site. However, after devoting quite a bit of time to the modification of the layout, I was neither completely satisfied with the result nor confident that even if I poured another large number of hours into customizing the site I could achieve the result I desired. Having come to that conclusion, I dropped Squarespace and returned my focus to strictly writing and working on a little side project named First Crack.</p>

<p>Jumping back in time, I discovered my first content management system soon after moving to WordPress.com. Unlike WordPress.com&#160;&#8212;&#160;a fully hosted and managed blogging engine requiring no local setup&#160;&#8212;&#160;WordPress.org required a server to run on and a relatively complex setup to get started. Immediately interested in the possibility of a new hosting solution and in particular the control this sort of option offered though, I decided to give it a try. Although today I cannot remember the exact amount of time I spent attempting to configure WordPress.org to work on my machine, thinking back I imagine it was not more than an hour before, frustrated, I deleted the folder and decided never to use the service again. Over the years during which I used WordPress.com as my primary blogging platform I occasionally revisited WordPress.org, but never quite got it to work. In a similar manner, after receiving a comment from another blogger who used Joomla for his site, I decided to give it a try; however, I achieved similar results as I had with WordPress.org and soon returned to my hosted WordPress.com site. I undoubtedly tried other content management systems over the years, but those are the two I remember most prominently. In each case, I ran into the same problem of an overly complex setup. Given that I attempted to implement WordPress.org and Joomla between the ages of thirteen and fifteen my results should be taken with a grain of salt, but the lesson I learned played a big part in the way in which I proceeded with the development of First Crack.</p>

<p>Between Zoomshare&#160;&#8212;&#160;which preceded Xanga&#160;&#8212;&#160;and my sabbatical from blogging, I also tried coding my own website numerous times. Unfortunately my inexperience barred its teeth in these situations though, and I quickly became discouraged when my designs failed to compete with the layouts and themes I had found on WordPress.com and its predecessors. These sites were short-lived and never amounted to anything other than serving to further my experience in design by providing examples of combinations that did not work. Later I became thankful for the extensive library of failed designs I had accumulated over the years though, as I could now use the experience I had gained as well as those failed designs as references in creating new, more attractive sites.</p>

<p>These experiences set the stage for the eventual development of First Crack. Dissatisfied with hosted solutions and existing content management systems alike, I began to consider the development of First Crack more seriously. Before I could focus solely on First Crack though, I had to answer one lingering question in my mind: did the ends&#160;&#8212;&#160;in this case the creation of an original content management system&#160;&#8212;&#160;justify the considerable amount of time I would need to devote to the construction of such a program, especially when other systems, regardless of how inadequate I had deemed them, already existed? To answer this question, I thought back to my past experiences with Webs, both WordPress blogging engines, Joomla, and Squarespace: in each case, I spent an inordinate amount of time in the pursuit of control, whether in the site&#8217;s layout as in the case of Squarespace or simply in the functionality of the engine itself as in the case of both WordPress engines. Time that I could have spent writing, I was forced to spend in a vain attempt at understanding a service obfuscated by the need to support hundreds of thousands of use cases. Based on my past experiences, I knew that no matter what service I stumbled upon in the future, this would not change. Having come to this conclusion, I had no difficulty in setting aside the time to develop First Crack.</p>

<p>Before I start talking about First Crack, I would like to take some time to talk a little about the lessons this journey taught me and how they influenced the guiding principles behind First Crack. First, then, from the online sites WordPress.com, Squarespace, and the like. From these services, I decided that affording the user complete and total control of the site&#8217;s design and layout must be of paramount importance. Every aspect of the site, from the number and IDs on the div elements to the version of jQuery, must be customizable. Based on my experiences with the various content management systems I attempted to use and WordPress.org and Joomla in particular, I determined that ease of installation and ease of use must also be a high priority in the design and implementation of First Crack as well. From some of the other blogging engines I experimented with, which I did not mention earlier, I decided upon smaller, less significant goals. For example, I determined that instant publication would be preferable to navigating to a certain webpage and publishing the post or using a particular terminal command thereby forcing First Crack to accept the new post. Finally, from tales&#160;&#8212;&#160;or horror stories, more accurately&#160;&#8212;&#160;of engines requiring upwards of eight minutes to rebuild a site and ten seconds to load a page, I decided that the speed of First Crack must always be a concern in the back of my mind. Set with these goals, I began to jot a note down here and there describing one feature or another until, my Simplenote screen nearly filled, I began coding.</p>

<p>In order to provide users of First Crack with the ability to control the look and feel of their sites completely, I based the entire design on a template file. Users of First Crack can build the template file with any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, save it as &#8220;Template.htm&#8221; within the appropriate folder, and every subsequent page build will utilize this design. Storing the page layout as a separate file also provided the additional benefit of allowing First Crack&#8217;s users to preview the layout of the site without creating unnecessary extra files to test the design in, thus creating a more streamlined design process. Next came my goal of providing the easiest use case possible. After seeing Marco Arment&#8217;s earliest implementation of Second Crack and the manner in which he required posts to be published, and after using some minor CMSs which required various actions to be taken in order to publish a post, I came to the conclusion that the easiest way to publish a post would be to simply drop the file into a particular directory. Thus, I created a folder named &#8220;Content&#8221; and directed First Crack to scan the contents of this folder. If the Structure folder&#160;&#8212;&#160;which, as you may guess, contains all the HTML files for the site to run on&#160;&#8212;&#160;contained a file with the same name as the content file and the update time of the two files matched, no files need be updated; however, if the update times differ or there is no corresponding structure file for any given content file, a new structure file will need to be built and the front page updated to reflect the latest post. Once the structure file is re-built, the update times of both files are set to match, thereby preventing First Crack from unnecessarily building files which do not need updated. By implementing such a procedure, making a new post to a blog containing a thousand other entries would take no longer than publishing the first article did. In conjunction with First Crack&#8217;s reliance on static files instead of dynamically generating the site, this approach also served to solve my concerns regarding speedy performance, both server-side when displaying the pages and locally when building the site.</p>

<p>So there you have it: First Crack affords its users complete and total control of the site&#8217;s design, literally drag-and-drop ease of use, and impressive speed as compared to some of the other CMSs on the market. As I continue to improve upon First Crack I strive to remove at least one reason a blogger would choose to use a different service with each release, but even at such a speed, there are certainly some reasons not to go with First Crack; however, I believe the advantages to adopting First Crack outweigh the disadvantages. For example, rather than requiring a web server such as Apache or XAMPP and a database in order to test and modify First Crack as some blog engines do, First Crack only requires that you have Python 3.2.3 or later and a capable browser installed on your machine. Insert Internet Explored joke here. Meeting this one requirement&#160;&#8212;&#160;the installation of Python&#160;&#8212;&#160;ensures that you will be able to modify, debug, and run First Crack with absolutely no additional configuration. Further, I am proud to state that First Crack is one of the few blogging engines that correctly parses Markdown as prescribed by John Gruber&#8217;s definition of the spec.</p>

<p>Before I finish this post I would like to spend some time discussing a few of the really neat features First Crack has to offer. First and foremost of these features, I believe, is the recently added command-line interface. Entered using the &#8220;-a&#8221; parameter, this interface currently supports three different actions: manually modifying a post&#8217;s update time using the &#8220;-t&#8221; command, rebuilding a single post from its content file by entering &#8220;-r&#8221; at the prompt, and rebuilding the entire site with the &#8220;-R&#8221; flag. Manually modifying a post&#8217;s update time has obvious practical uses, but the ability to rebuild a single post or every post on the site might be a bit harder to find useful at first glance. Consider, then, the manner through which changes to the site&#8217;s design are applied: &#8220;Users of First Crack can build the template file with any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, save it as &#8216;Template.htm&#8217; within the appropriate folder, and every subsequent page build will utilize this design.&#8221; Such an approach, while perfect for fledgling blogs without any posts, becomes problematic on an exponential scale as the number of posts increases. By rebuilding all articles from their source, however, any changes made to the template file will be reflected in the new structure files, and the posts&#8217; update time will not be modified. The ability to force a single page rebuild, on the other hand, can be useful if something goes wrong during the update process and a structure file is corrupted.</p>

<p>After all this talk of facilitating complete site customization with First Crack, the last point I would like to make before finishing this article is that you can also simply let the CMS do its job. You do not need to change the CSS selectors for the post elements or include a new jQuery library if that is not what you want to do. If you simply wish to write and have your content published to the web, write your posts, double-click &#8220;Update.py&#8221;, and let First Crack take care of the rest. This experience only needs to be as involved as you want it to be.</p>

<p>With that I believe I am finished. Hopefully this article has piqued enough interest to bring you over to <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">First Crack&#8217;s GitHub page</a> where you can download the source code and give my creation a whirl. I would love to hear your feedback on First Crack in particular, but any sort of comment is welcome, whether related to the site&#8217;s design, my writing style, or the CMS itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.5by5.tv/articles/2012/11/18/state-of-the-union-address-for-2012">Dan Benjamin&#8217;s recent announcement</a> that both <a href="https://twitter.com/hypercritical/status/270245123676319744">John Siracusa</a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/11/18/build-analyze-ending">Marco Arment</a> would draw their run on 5by5 to a close during the month of December gave me the final push I needed to finally publish this blog.

I certainly regret the passing of these two excellent shows, but I wish both Marco and John the best in their future endeavors; and I have faith in Dan Benjamin, that he will continue to produce the best podcasts on the internet.</p>

<p>Roughly two years ago I went on a search for an archive of Jonathan Goldstein&#8217;s CBC radio program Wiretap. This search led me to dig through NPR&#8217;s program archive, scour torrent trackers for a private collection, and, eventually, search Apple&#8217;s podcast directory, where I finally succeeded in my endeavor. With the culmination of Wiretap&#8217;s first season though, I gradually fell out of step and presently abandoned the world of podcasts for quite some time. A few months later, I happened across 5by5&#8217;s newest fledgling podcast, Hypercritical. Hosted by Dan Benjamin and John Siracusa, the pair hooked me on the first episode with an impressively in-depth discussion regarding the state of the television industry and solutions for time-shifting your viewing including the much-hated TiVo solution, a topic which used disruption as a segue to a discussion of the music industry and the reasons Apple revolutionized that space with the advent of the iTunes Store. Continuing the trend in Backup Vortex, John and Dan spent nearly an hour and a half discussing computer backups in the now-famous second episode of Hypercritcal; with this episode, I began my walk down the path of podcasting geekery.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a gentle push in the direction of podcasting, Hypercritical&#8217;s second episode also piqued my interest enough to explore other 5by5 podcasts, including the infant Back to Work which aired its first episode just three days before Backup Vortex hit the stream. After slightly more than twenty minutes of introductions and nervous conversation, Merlin Mann checked me into the wall with his explanation of procrastination:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Merlin: Procrastination is an effect, not a cause&#160;&#8212;&#160;in my opinion.</p>
<p>Dan: What&#8217;s the cause?</p>
<p>Merlin: What&#8217;s the cause of procrastination?</p>
<p>Dan: Yeah.</p>
<p>Merlin: Really?</p>
<p>Dan: Yeah.</p>
<p>Merlin: This is the hippiest thing I&#8217;ll say on here today: it&#8217;s when you temporarily forget who you are or who you want to be; it&#8217;s when you forget what you&#8217;re supposed to be paying attention to and when you lose confidence about what your options are for doing something about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the next year I continued to listen to both Hypercritical and Back to Work, as well as a number of the other 5by5 programs. Specifically, I came across Build &#38; Analyze, The Big Web Show, The Daily Edition, The Dev Show, and On The Internet, all of which I subscribed to. I also tried&#160;&#8212;&#160;numerous times&#160;&#8212;&#160;to get into The Talk Show, Dan Benjamin&#8217;s first 5by5 podcast and the show that started it all, though with little success for the first year or so; however, I soon came around and subscribed to that podcast too. At the height of my podcasting consumption around this time, I subscribed to eight podcasts and listened to more than ten hours of program each day in an effort to not only stay current on the latest releases of each podcast, but also so that I could work my way through the back catalog of previously-aired episodes.</p>

<p>Up to this point my focus has remained solely focused on 5by5 programs, leaving out all other podcasts. The reason for this is, unfortunately, quite simple: back then I subscribed exclusively to 5by5 podcasts not due to any prejudice against other podcast producers, but for the simple reason that even among the best podcasts, few could hold a candle to the quality present in any one of the episodes released in a 5by5 feed. Certainly not for lack of trying, but simply because Dan Benjamin is just <em>that good</em> at what he does. Dan actually talked about his impressive setup in an episode of After Dark&#160;&#8212;&#160;a special podcast recorded &#8220;after Dan and his co-hosts hit &#8216;STOP&#8217; and their official shows are over. Behind the scenes, casual, unedited, and uncensored.&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;entitled <a href="http://5by5.tv/afterdark/75"><em>Pamphlet</em></a>. I strongly recommend listening to this episode if you wish to know the best way to go about podcasting. For more podcasting recommendations regarding the best hardware and software to use, Dan posted an article on his personal blog, <a href="http://hivelogic.com">Hivelogic</a>, entitled <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/podcasting-equipment-software-guide-2011"><em>Podcasting Equipment Guide 2011</em></a> midway through last year. Both the episode of After Dark and his blog past are excellent resources for the beginning and the seasoned podcaster alike.</p>

<p>As time has passed some of the podcasts that initially attracted me to 5by5 have retired for one reason or another. The Daily Edition, for example, as well as The Dev Show and On The Internet all came to a rather abrupt end. Other programs such as The Talk Show and Let&#8217;s Make Mistakes, on the other hand, have moved to the Mule Radio Syndicate, where they continue to broadcast today. As one door closed another opened though, as shows such as Amplified, The B&#38;B Podcast, The Critical Path, In Beta, and Systematic have all made a home at 5by5 Productions, as numerous other podcasts have as well.</p>

<p>All in all, Dan Benjamin has been remarkably successful in this space&#160;&#8212;&#160;a pioneer in the field of podcasting. Given the level of success his network has experienced since opening its doors in 2009, one might conjecture as to why he has succeeded so spectacularly when others have either experienced much more moderate success or outright failed.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Quality">Quality<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Quality">#</a></span></h3>
<p>The most striking aspect of the 5by5 podcast lineup lies in the quality of each episode. Not simply the quality of the audio though, but also the quality every co-host brings to each podcast, neatly packaged and expertly compressed into an easily-manageable MP3 file. Unlike NPR, where the sound of the hosts&#8217; mouths opening and closing is, quite unfortunately, audible in nearly every program, Dan has struck the delicate balance between manageable file sizes and&#160;&#8212;&#160;quite literally&#160;&#8212;&#160;grossly high-quality recordings as in the case of NPR. When a host speaks, his or her voice rings through loud and clear; during the occasional pause, on the other hand, regardless of how loud the recording is played at, absolutely nothing&#160;&#8212;&#160;not even white noise&#160;&#8212;&#160;plays through the speaker. Exceptional quality does not stop at audio fidelity and manageable file sizes though, but extends also into the content of each and every broadcast episode. Often I find myself wondering how Dan found a given co-host and how he convinced that prominent internet figure to sit down and record a podcast every week, the result of which is at least an hour of excellent insight into any number of different industries and markets. Take, for example, The Critical Path hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco">Horace Dediu</a> of <a href="http://www.asymco.com/">Asymco.com</a>: a podcast focusing largely on disruption theory, Horace studies Apple as a benchmark to which other companies can be compared to in order to better understand the causes of success and failure in today&#8217;s mobile computing market. Slightly more than a year after the first episode of The Critical Path aired midway through 2011, Horace has sorted through, arranged, and condensed the first year&#8217;s worth of podcast content into a book: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2092675260/the-critical-path-the-first-year">The Critical Path: The First Year</a>. Also among 5by5&#8217;s impressive list of hosts, Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, editor of The Magazine, and writer at Marco.org, hosts Build &#38; Analyze, a popular podcast intermittently discussing the business of building, marketing, and selling an app through Apple&#8217;s App Store between offering parenting advice and continuing the never-ending coffee discussion. Other prominent bloggers such as <a href="https://twitter.com/jdalrymple">Jim Dalrymple</a> of <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/">The Loop</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ginatrapani">Gina Trapani</a> previously of Lifehacker, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">Merlin Mann</a> of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>, and <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">You Look Nice Today</a> all call 5by5 home. 5by5 produces some of the best podcasts available to date, conveying the words of insightful internet superheroes at high-fidelity in one small file. These and other similar programs have placed Dan Benjamin forever on the map of podcast fans everywhere, and have also given rise to <a href="http://5by5illustrated.com/">a</a> <a href="http://meandyou.ws/">number</a> of <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/354xvf/">memes</a> throughout the years since he began broadcasting full-time in 2009.</p>

<p>As Dan Benjamin&#8217;s success in the podcasting industry grew&#160;&#8212;&#160;explosively so with the advent of Back to Work and Hypercritical&#160;&#8212;&#160;other podcast producers began to take notice of both his business and the manner in which he conducted that business. This growth in popularity and attention marked the beginning of a steady increase in the number of podcasts on the 5by5 network, which would end in the addition of more than ten podcasts to the already impressive list of shows and result in an accordingly large surge in the popularity of the network. As I said, the growing popularity of the 5by5 network also attracted attention from other podcast producers. This led to an almost exponential increase in the quality of non-5by5 podcasts over the next few years. Although this growth in quality could be the result of natural progression over time, empirical evidence suggests that Dan Benjamin greatly influenced and possibly even set into motion this transition as others strove to emulate his success. We can draw parallels between this occurrence and the release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(original">the first iPhone</a>) <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1054769/iphone.html">back in 2007</a> which revolutionized the mobile phone industry, causing the incumbents to scramble to respond or, most notably in the case of Samsung, simply copy the latest and greatest device in order to survive.</p>

<p>In addition to setting into motion an industry-wide broadcast quality renaissance, Dan Benjamin&#8217;s growing popularity also led to the adoption of his business model by other fledgling podcast networks. Just as many websites adopted John Gruber&#8217;s practice of posting links to news stories along with relevant commentary once that model was proven fanatically successful, podcast produces such as Mike Monteiro of The Mule Radio Syndicate and Myke Hurley of 70 Decibels have adopted Dan Benjamin&#8217;s proven business model of a single network producing numerous primarily technology-related programs, with each program featuring one or more hosts along with the occasional guest, supported by on-air ad readings. Rather than crediting Dan Benjamin with causing another evolution in the podcasting industry this happenstance could be argued, like the evolution of overall podcast quality in the past three years, as simply result of the logical progression in this industry as a function of time. This same theory was argued in the Apple v. Samsung copyright suit when Samsung attempted to defend blatantly copying Apple&#8217;s designs, saying that Apple&#8217;s patents should be nullified as both the form factor and interface designs were a result of the natural progression of mobile devices over time, not the result of a designer&#8217;s ingenuity. The jury ruled against Samsung, signifying that regardless of whether or not natural progression is a valid defensive argument in the case, the fact of the matter was that Apple created an ingenious design, and Samsung copied it. Yet another parallel can be drawn between Dan Benjamin&#8217;s podcast network and the world of Apple, as Dan Benjamin was the first successful network to adopt such a business model, and now others are beginning to follow in his footsteps.</p>

<p>As an aside I would like to make it clear that my intent in comparing podcast producers and Mike Monteiro in particular to Samsung is not to disparage their work or cast the fruit of their labors in any sort of negative light; rather, I simply find it interesting that so many parallels can be drawn between the podcasting industry and those that Dan Benjamin discuss with his co-hosts on their podcasts, and feel that the readers of this article may also find these similarities of interest.</p>

<p>Beginning in the early days of 5by5 and on through the relatively slow years leading up to the release of Back to Work and Hypercritical and the frenzy that ensued, we have examined the history behind 5by5 Productions, allowing us to contemplate the causality of success and failure, to use a line from The Critical Path&#8217;s description, in this industry. To liken 5by5 to Apple, both companies began modestly: Dan with The Talk Show, and Apple with the Macintosh. Both companies sustained a respectable rate of development for quite some time until each experienced explosive growth, sending both to the forefront of their respective industries. Just like Apple, 5by5 continues to impress year after year; and just like Apple, Dan shows no signs of stopping any time soon.</p>

<time class='dt-published' id='article_time' datetime="2012-11-19 19:50:20-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2012.html">2012</a>/<a href="/blog/2012-11.html">11</a>/19 19:50:20 EST</time>
<p>In my last post, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hosts.html">Getting Started on WordPress.com, Tumblr, or Squarespace</a>, I briefly touched on an important design principle towards the end of the article, where I cautioned against choosing a theme that did not showcase your work to the fullest extent possible. I did not, however, explain my reasons for this caution. In the beginning I considered design to be of paramount importance. Even more so, in fact, than the content itself. As the years went by and my experience grew though, that opinion did an about-face, and quite some time passed during which I considered the design to be tertiary to the content in a system containing but two players. Today, however, I have finally come to a compromise, where I believe that a site&#8217;s design and the content that fills it are equally important and thus should complement each other, not vie for the attention of the viewer.</p>

<p>The notion of a content-centric design&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, a layout built with the intention of showcasing content first&#160;&#8212;&#160;came as news to me when I first heard of such a school of thought on an episode of the <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow">Big Web Show</a>, one of the many excellent podcasts on the <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a> network. At the time I did not pay much attention to the discussion though as I had no plans to design my own website, in any sort of capacity, in the near future. However, a few months later, after learning of Marco Arment&#8217;s plans to build his own content management system, I began to seriously consider website design once again as I started coding my own CMS.</p>

<p>I began this journey without knowing where or even how to start, so I began by looking at different website designs in an attempt to discover a workable theme. I experimented with numerous layouts and color schemes, devoured articles on basic design principles, absorbed discussions on usability, and sought hints and pointers from bloggers I strive to emulate, all in an attempt at finding that one layout that just <em>clicks</em>. Although I did not end up using any of the designs created during this time period, the experience and knowledge I gained have proved invaluable. For example, I crafted a design based on the Hacker News homepage shortly after I began looking to the site as my main source of tech news. Impressed with the simplicity of the resulting design and the focus it placed on the content, this experiment resulted in the definition of my two most important design principles: the first, that a design should be as minimalistic as possible, and second, that showcasing the creator&#8217;s content is the most important job for the design to accomplish. These two principles stuck with me throughout the next few months as I continued to develop First Crack and, after a while, craft a redesign of the site.</p>

<p>Following my Hacker News-esq design, I spent some more time experimenting with different layouts, one of which closely resembled <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc&#8217;s</a> current design. As its predecessors though, I eventually replaced this design with yet another in my never-ending quest to find a suitable theme. After some more searching, I stumbled upon a neat template consisting simply of a menu bar positioned roughly a quarter of the way down the page. With the exception of the menu bar&#160;&#8212;&#160;a snazzy gradient sporting neat expandable menu items&#160;&#8212;&#160;-the page was blank. Fitting my first design principle, that the design should be as minimalistic as possible, I started tweaking the design. As time passed and I spent more and more time working with the template, I eventually decided to move the most recent blog post above the menu bar. This decision came only after much consideration, and brought with it a new problem: posts consisting of a single paragraph required a relatively small amount of space to display. For much longer posts, however, changing the most recent article&#8217;s location proved problematic, as doing so moved the navigation bar out of the window and, in some cases, quite far down the screen. This also brought another usability issue to a head: scrolling through a list of lengthy posts proved time consuming and served to provide a poor user experience. The solution I eventually came up with used a dash of jQuery to dynamically shorten the amount of text displayed on the home page to the first paragraph of each article, replacing the rest of the text with a &#8220;Read More...&#8221; link that would expand upon activation. Later I would change the &#8220;Read More...&#8221; link&#8217;s functionality by causing it to redirect to a unique article page, an action which I eventually incorporated in to First Crack in order to eliminate the need for a jQuery function to parse an entire article.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the site&#8217;s structure, I began to work on more esoteric facets of the design such as colors, textures, and fonts. Initially I intended to use Courier New as the font for the entire website given that Sublime Text, my editor of choice, shipped with it by default; however, as time passed I gradually realized that it was not created to be an especially readable font, and therefore began my search for a suitable replacement. This experience served to introduce me to the world of web fonts, prompted me to take a particular interest in a recurring discussion on Build &#38; Analyze at the time as Marco Arment discussed several of the new fonts he had shipped with the latest version of Instapaper, and eventually led me to Google Web Fonts in an attempt to perfect my design. Impressed with the extensive library Google Web Fonts offered, I quickly implemented a different font for article titles, sub-titles, and the article content itself. Once the initial excitement wore off though, I took a more sobered look at my choice in fonts, and considered the implications of relying on a third party to host such an important resource.</p>

<p>First, and I did not particularly notice this until after learning more about the science behind fonts, none of the Google fonts looked particularly <em>great</em>, especially at the larger sizes I use for my article titles and sub-titles. In addition to mediocre display, relying on an external source for such an important facet of my site&#8217;s design made my uncomfortable, as I had no control whatsoever over these resources. Finally, the implementation of these three fonts would also introduce some additional load time that, regardless of how little, I would prefer to avoid if possible. Having considered these implications, I removed the custom fonts from my site and began to search for a font that was both universal and well hinted. By &#8220;universal&#8221; I mean a font that would be universal to all computing platforms and therefore would not be necessary to load from an external source as was required for any of the Google Web Fonts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting">Font hinting</a>, in the most basic sense, is a process in which mathematical &#8220;hints&#8221; are embedded within a font in order to adjust its display for the clearest presentation possible. In a world no longer dominated simply by computers but instead by increasingly large numbers of mobile devices, ensuring that the font I eventually chose met both these criteria was extremely important to me. After some digging, I discovered that Verdana is both a universal font and also contains an unusually large amount of hinting data, virtually ensuring clear presentation cross-platform and on retina screens such as the iPad.</p>

<p>Having chose a suitable font for my site, I began developing a color scheme. During this process, I used websites such as <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">Color Scheme Designer</a> to assist in choosing suitable color combinations. After numerous unsatisfactory experiments though, I began to take a different approach: rather than choosing a color at random, testing it on my site, and then rejecting it, I began paying special attention to the various color schemes, background images, and textures employed by the various websites I visited throughout the day, hoping to derive a suitable solution to my problem. Shortly after coming to this conclusion, I did just that by finally settling on a page and menu bar background using a texture from the 5by5 website. I was particularly pleased with the result of this combination, as the light background image made the dark gray font easily readable, and the slightly darker background texture for the menu bar served to separate the latest post, located above the menu bar, from the rest of the page below it. More importantly though, the site just <em>looked</em> good: the colors were easy on the eyes and the textures gave the page a nice feel.</p>

<p>I have taken you on the journey I underwent in order to create this design; however, I still have not explained the importance of a content-centric design. Before I do that though, I would like to explain my reasons for taking you through that journey rather than simply giving you the answer you seek. I plan to delve deeper into this topic sometime soon, but I will cover it briefly now. First and foremost, I chose to chronicle this design process in painful detail as a way to show the level of involvement creating a website requires. Designing a website not only entails creating the necessary HTML structure, but it also requires serious consideration of every other facet related to the presentation of that structure, from the background color to the font for the header and, quite literally, everything in between.</p>

<p>Second to that first reason, I also wanted to show how long this process can become. I did not explicitly state this earlier in the article, but I spent more than a year working with various designs in order to finally come to the current one. Granted your experience might be much faster than mine, but, by the same token, it could take you quite a while longer to craft your design as well. Regardless of whether it takes you one month, twelve, or some number between the two, keep at it. Design is not an easy skill to develop; for those of us that are not naturally-gifted designers, the only way to get better at design&#160;&#8212;&#160;much like writing, programming, and virtually everything else&#160;&#8212;&#160;is to design, make mistakes, and be okay with that.</p>

<p>My third and final reason for creating that long, drawn out monologue was to show that more likely than not, you will not create a suitable design the first time around, nor the second, nor the third&#160;&#8212;&#160;nor should you. Much like writing, design is an iterative process. Further, as in writing where a given piece should never really be considered finished, you will never finish a design, it will simply escape one day and you will be forced to be done with it.</p>

<p>To close this article, I will finally explain the importance of a content-centric design: when a user navigates to your website for the first time, his or her attention will naturally travel down the page from top to bottom. However, flashy banner ads, loud colors, and poor placement of design elements such as menus, for example, all serve to take away from the attention that would otherwise by placed on your content. When crafting your website design, you must ask yourself this question with the addition of each page element, picture, ad banner, or anything else that is not actual content: is the attention my content will lose to this worth the trade off?</p>

<p>Hey everybody, my name is <a href="http://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk">Zachary Szewczyk</a>. I am an eighteen-year-old writer and programmer, aspiring designer, and general computer geek working my way through high school. Some of you may recognize my name from a past blog or once-popular article, but by and large I am unknown on the internet. As I begin to write more and work through the extensive backlog of article topics I have gathered throughout the past few years though, I plan to take after the likes of Marco Arment and Jim Dalrymple as I cover subjects ranging from the writer&#8217;s craft to the neat little CMS I built for this site to my thoughts on Microsoft&#8217;s relevance in today&#8217;s tech scene. I have grand plans for this blog, and high expectations. Hopefully this brief introduction has roused enough interest to bring you back to learn more about that CMS, hear me talk about the writer&#8217;s craft, delve into the complex world of coding, and muddle my way through the complexity that is design. Check back often; my first actual post should go live within a few hours.</p>

<p>With that, then, we&#8217;re live.</p>
