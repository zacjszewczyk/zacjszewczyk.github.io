In a brief departure from his daily Tab Dump series, Stefan Constantinescu wrote about the LG G Flex. He did not write a review though, but instead a rather introspective essay about how the single advantage to this device and what that signaled for the future of the mobile phone industry. Quite a while has passed since the 5S came out, and even longer since Apple did anything new with their flagship phone's form factor. We have already seen releases from the other major smartphone players, and it's about time Apple added to the cacophony. I can't wait to see what they come out with.
