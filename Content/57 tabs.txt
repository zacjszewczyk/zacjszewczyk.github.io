A few days ago Stefan Constantinescu of [Tab Dump](http://tabdump.com/) wrote an article titled [*Making Some Bets*](http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/1/22/making-some-bets), where he announced his decision to go fully independent and rely on his writing to support himself. The latest in [a](http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/) string [of](http://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/) similar resolutions, his decision gained a bit of attention, through which I came across [*February 04: 57 tabs*](http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/2/4/february-04-57-tabs) earlier this morning. The broad range of topics he covers makes for very interesting reading and highlights great articles I would never have found otherwise, but I could get that from any old news reader. Rather, it is the unique format and accompanying succinct summarizations that I find so compelling about Stefan's new daily venture, and it doesn't hurt that he includes enough articles to keep me set for a day or two, at least, with each installment. I really like this new thing Stefan decided to do, and I think you will too. Definitely go check it out.
