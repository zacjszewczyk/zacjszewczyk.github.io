Stefan Constantinescu has some very interesting ideas regarding Apple's future plans for its mobile phone line with the launch of the iPhone 6 this fall. I wrote about [my thoughts on the topic](Its a Crapshoot.txt) a couple weeks ago, but the possibility of an iPhone 6C built according to the new form factor of the 6 with 5S internals did not occur to me. Very interesting, both this idea and his reasoning behind the imminence of a larger iPhone, and his justification for the form factor he ultimately puts forth as most likely in the coming year. Well worth the read.
