Very few people actually enjoy Mondays. If you're in the majority, I've got the cure for you: check out [Andy Martin on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/andymartin), where he posts delightfully weird short animations. My favorite is easily [Selfie](http://vimeo.com/87447382), and if you enjoy that one [The Welsh Egg Choir](http://vimeo.com/73866722) and his [The Plants](http://vimeo.com/channels/theplanets) series are both great ways to spend a few extra minutes blissfully unaware of the drudgery that is the first in a long succession of nine-to-five days. Enjoy.
