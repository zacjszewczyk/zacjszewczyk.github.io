I like Antonio's idea, a lot. As much as [I try to keep my system stock](My Setup 2019.txt), this will make transferring the scripts and aliases I have accumulated to new machines super easy. A few of my favorite aliases:

```
$ alias gs="git status"
$ alias gac="git add . && git commit -m"
$ alias gp="git push"
```

[I have talked about these aliases before](My Setup 2019.txt); they make interacting with Git just a little bit easier. [Hat-tip to Ire Aderinokun for the idea](https://bitsofco.de/git-aliases-for-lazy-developers/).

<pre class="shell">
alias gits="find ./ -name '.git' 2> /dev/null | grep -v '.Trash'"
</pre>

This neat snippet searches the current directory, and all sub directories, for Git repos. I have a lot of coding projects [in the works](/projects.html), and this helps me keep track of them.

<pre class="shell">
alias r="source ~/.bash_profile"
</pre>

This lets me refresh my bash profile whenever I make a change--for example, adding a new alias or script. Simple, and handy.

<pre class="shell">
alias search="grep -rnw './' -e "
</pre>

This alias gives me search functionality in the terminal, so I can avoid opening up Finder for most simple queries.

<pre class="shell">
alias tree="find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g'"
</pre>

This neat little command displays the current directory contents, and all its sub-directories, as a tree. I used this to create the tree in [the First Crack readme file](/projects.html#firstCrack). [Hat-tip to OS X Daily for this one](http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/09/view-folder-tree-terminal-mac-os-tree-equivalent/).
