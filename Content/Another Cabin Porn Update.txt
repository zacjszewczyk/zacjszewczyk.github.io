Rather than posting separate articles for each cool cabin I came across or interesting story I found on [Cabin Porn](http://freecabinporn.com) throughout this past day, I decided to condense the day's updates into a single post. There are a few cabins, however, whose stories merited more than a simple line item on an imposingly long list, and for those I did make an exception.  

* [140 Acre Gold Mining Claim](http://freecabinporn.com/post/25183549412/from-peter-anderson-so-i-bought-a-140-acre-gold). Certainly not the nicest of cabins, and I don't know much about real estate, but I'd say Peter Anderson made off with a steal at just $3,000 for this massive plot and the accompanying cabins. What a catch.  
* [Cabin between Austria and Slovenia](http://freecabinporn.com/post/24130198168/cabin-between-austria-and-slovenia-submitted-and). This view reminded me of a hike I took with a Boy Scout troop during my trip to South Africa in the hills surrounding Barberton. We hiked up the mountain one day, camped in a small building similar to this cabin, and rode bikes down the mountain the next day. Another very fond memory of my trip there.  
* [Adirondack](http://freecabinporn.com/post/22253288058/adirondack-shelter-in-oil-creek-state-park). I slept in this very adirondack one cold and rainy weekend a few years ago, and have spent many a night in an adirondack since then. Wonderful little buildings and a great way to spend the night.  
* [Hackey Shed](http://freecabinporn.com/post/21784037353/hackney-shed-by-office-sian-in-london-england). I absolutely love the idea of an open workspace such as this one and one that can easily be closed if the weather takes a turn for the worse while still allowing for a spectacular view.  
* [Hut](http://freecabinporn.com/post/16440397386/hut-in-niigata-prefecture-japan-submitted-by). I took a particular liking to this "cabin", if it could even be called that, not because the structure was anything special, but because of the spectacular mountain range it sits atop. Absolutely beautiful.  
* [Allandale House](http://freecabinporn.com/post/14362535618/allandale-house-by-william-obrien). One of the more picturesque A-frames I was able to find on Cabin Porn.  
* [Puumaja project](http://freecabinporn.com/post/9077333990/andrew-ranvilles-puumaja-project-meaning). The first actual tree house I found on Cabin Porn: all the others were suspended mere feet from the ground. Very impressive--not only for designing a well thought-out tree house, but also in designing an attractive one.
