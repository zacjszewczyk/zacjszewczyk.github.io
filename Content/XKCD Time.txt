"Randall Munroe's web comic XKCD has long been known for pushing boundaries in strange ways, but his latest experiment topped them all. Over the course of four months, "Time" grew as a frame was added every 30 minutes or so, ending up with over 3,000 individual frames by the time it wrapped up earlier this week."

I absolutely love XKCD. I have read every one of Randall Munroe's 1246 comics, and *Time*--which you can watch in its entirety over at [Aubron Wood](http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/)--is one of my favorites. I plan to read the next 1246 strips as well; I suggest you do the same.
