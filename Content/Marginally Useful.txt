Interesting article from MIT's Technology Review on Bitcoin's potential uses outside of a new currency. I have written to the topic of Bitcoin a [few times](Thoughts on Bitcoin.txt) in [the past](How Bitcoin will plummet.txt), but beyond covering it here I have had no interaction with Bitcoin whatsoever. Nevertheless, it remains a topic of great interest to me, and will undoubtedly go on to play a significant role in the future of not only global currencies, but internet commerce of all types as well.
