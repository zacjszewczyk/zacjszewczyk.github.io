This situation really is crazy. Part of the problem, though, at least where Twitter is concerned, is that Twitter does not use the t.co shortener until *after* a tweet is posted, which means after it imposes the 140 character limit. Especially for me where every link to one of my own articles that I post starts with "zacjszewczyk.com/Structure", this makes not using my own shortener--in this case, Bitly--completely impractical. Even then though, there is no real justification for even this many redirects, and especially not as many as Scott found here. Insane.
