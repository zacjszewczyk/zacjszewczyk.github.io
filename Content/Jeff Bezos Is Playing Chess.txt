Last night I posted a link to John Gruber's commentary of MG Siegler's article cited above. I found Gruber's realization that rather than a floundering monolith Amazon is instead a flourishing innovator pouring almost the entirety of its profits back in to the very ecosystem responsible for creating that revenue in the first place a very interesting one, especially given Mathew Alexander's similar sentiment expressed on a past episode of his podcast [Bionic](http://5by5.tv/bionic).  

Today I got around to reading the original piece from MG Siegler, and I couldn't agree with Gruber more: it's a wonderful article well worth the read, especially for those who do not fully understand Amazon and the Apple community's continued fascination with the company.
