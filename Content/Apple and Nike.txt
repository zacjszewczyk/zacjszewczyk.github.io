Ben Thompson has been killing it over at Stratechery lately, especially with this piece comparing Apple and Nike through the apt characterization of experience companies. As a recent convert from the Windows world, I can speak to the reality of Apple's unique (within the technology industry, at least) position as such a corporation from first-hand experience: from the outside looking in, I couldn't help but want to join this community and become a part of the Apple world. There are undoubtedly those who will discount even the accuracy of Apple's designation as an experience company rather than a behemoth fostering a cult of fanatic worshipers willing to pay any sum for their latest POS--and that's not "point of service"--offering, much less the ability for that to compel anyone to Apple's platforms over Windows and Android. However, it is very real. And most importantly, it's working.
