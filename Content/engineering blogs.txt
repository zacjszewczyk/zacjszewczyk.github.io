Back in November of last year, [I linked to](How to Encourage A Blogging Culture.txt) an interesting article by Noah Gibbs on [how to encourage a blogging culture at your company](http://codefol.io/posts/encourage-a-blogging-culture-at-your-company/). Where Noah focused more on the individual, Dan Luu--in [*How (some) good corporate engineering blogs are written*](https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/)--looks at organizational factors that lead to successful corporate blogs. I encourage giving both a read. As I begin working toward a version of this at work, I found referring to both helpful.
