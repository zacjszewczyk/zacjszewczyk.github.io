Looking for a fun read over the slow weekend? Check out Linus Edwards' article *The Existential Plight Of The Video Game Hero*. I planned on linking to it in my newsletter shortly after he published the piece earlier this week on Monday, but got mired in [the uncertainty that ultimately led to that newsletter ending](Me the Writer.txt) before I got the chance. Unfortunately, it's a pretty short read. I look forward to seeing more work in this genre from him in the future though, so if you--like me--really enjoy this piece, check back often: I doubt either of us will have to wait long.
