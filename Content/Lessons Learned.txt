In 2012, Shawn Blanc marked the fifth anniversary of starting his site by publishing an article titled [*50 Things I've Learned About Publishing a Weblog*](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/07/50-things/). Filled with some of the best advice I have ever read on the subject, I return to this article every few months, gleaning just a little bit more each time. When I look back on the years since I started following Shawn, this piece stands out in my mind as his best work. And so, given how much I enjoyed his advice, I thought I would create my own list of lessons learned over the last few years of writing on the web.  

Taking a cue from Shawn, I will do my best to keep most of these brief; however, a few warrant some explanation, and so when necessary I will break uniformity for the sake of clarity.  

* The incumbents became huge and successful for a reason, and have remained huge and successful for a reason. The former and latter are not always the same.  

* Failing to fully understand something is often the reason so many discount and disparage it.  

* Spend more time complimenting others' work than criticizing it.  

* "You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with." [Credit Patrick McKenzie](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) for this gem I couldn't resist adding in here.  

* Never say "I could have done that." Maybe you could have, but you didn't, so you have lost the privilege to claim that idea as your own.  

* Take incredible pride in your own work.  

* Show up every day prepared to work harder than yesterday.  

* Never waste your time.  

* Never waste another's time.  

* Realize that everyone values their own time more than everyone else's; in other words, as much as you value your own.  

* You will never regret reading more than you write.  

* Always have a good reason for everything you do.  

* Never lose sight of an ultimate end-goal informing your every decision, lest you stray from your intended path and fall to ruin.  

* You probably aren't as smart as you think you are.  

* Everyone else is definitely not as dumb as you think.  

* You may very well be wrong.  

* You will always be wrong to someone.  

* For some, you will always be wrong.  

* Some people will never agree with you, no matter what you say or do or how much evidence you may present in support of your case.  

* Very few things are categorically anything.  

* Very few people consciously commit acts of wrongdoing or knowingly state inaccurate facts.  

* Everyone has their reasons, all of which are perfectly valid and justifiable in their mind.  

* Simple stupidity rarely motivates anyone.  

* Confrontation only solves problems when one party can force another to change the way they act and think. You can do neither over the internet.  

* Pay attention to the people who like you, and those who do not. Both their opinions have merit, both only to an extent. Take everything, both good and bad, with a grain of salt.
