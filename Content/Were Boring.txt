Matt Alexander of One Thirty Seven made so many interesting points I had a hard time choosing an excerpt of acceptable length for this post. I ended up settling on this one though, reflective of the tone throughout his exceptionally well-written article *We're Boring, They're Sexting*:  

    "Sitting on the front porch of our quaint weblogs and latte-art-filled Instagram accounts, we're collectively yelling at the kids playing in the street using these platforms in newer, happier, and increasingly care-free ways. These kids have been born into a world of social networking and privacy concerns are literally the last things on their minds. They're just looking for the next best way to chat, flirt, and sext their way into each other's bedrooms, whilst we continue to perpetuate unwritten societal rules of etiquette for Twitter and Facebook."  

I can't say enough good things about this piece--just go read it for yourself. And while you're at it, read Josh Miller's post referenced in the first paragraph of Matt Alexander's article, [*Tenth Grade Tech Trends*](https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3).
