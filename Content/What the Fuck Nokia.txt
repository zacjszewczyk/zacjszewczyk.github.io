Jim Dalrymple with his characteristically ambiguous thoughts regarding Nokia's latest commercial, hot on the tails of Apple's [spectacular](Misunderstood.txt) ad *Misunderstood*: "Kids, this is why you don't do drugs while making a TV ad." I normally wouldn't have linked to such a thing as this, but it illustrates exactly why everyone devoted so much time and attention to *Misunderstood* when it came out: with such "competition", how could we not? Jim had one more thought on *For Work. For Play.*, which he posted [to Twitter](https://twitter.com/jdalrymple/status/413328786412040193) shortly after linking it:  

> "So Apple comes out with a TV ad that brings a tear to your eye and Nokia scares the shot out of me."  

Precisely.
