I wanted to add some terminal output styling to a work project, but the [ANSI color codes](http://pueblo.sourceforge.net/doc/manual/ansi_color_codes.html) just would not work. A quick search lead me to this awesome article by Li Haoyi, [*Build your own Command Line with ANSI escape codes*](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html). His post gave me just what I needed, and pushed me to make [First Crack](/projects.html#firstCrack)'s command line interface a bit better by adding support for cursor navigation. It took some fiddling, but thanks to [a helpful tip from commenter dkrmr](https://pastebin.com/7YpKyKPe), I got it working.

I did not plan on linking to his article, but after referencing it for two days, I came around. Li pulls off some pretty cool stuff with some pretty basic tools. Very cool.
