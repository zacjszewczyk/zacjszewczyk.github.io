Recently I have begun exercising more restrain when deciding whether to publish a link post or not, attempting to decrease the lopsided original content to echo piece ratio by posting more of my own work than others'. I find it somewhat ironic, then, that today's first link post goes to John Gruber's linked list item commenting on Ed Dale's [*Smart Move Apple*](http://www.eddale.co/general/smart-move-apple).
