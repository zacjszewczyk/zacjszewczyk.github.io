My problem, if it could even be called that, with my obviously beloved Cabin Porn tumblr is not really a problem as much as a twinge of disappointment I felt as I made my way through all fifty-six pages on the site. I was disappointed because as I neared and eventually surpassed the halfway point, fewer of the cabins were actually that: a cabin; rather, many of the structures featured on Cabin Porn were more akin to small houses than the cozy, generally handcrafted buildings nestled away from civilization I came to the site looking for. It got progressively worse as I approached the final page. Now granted, in recent years the folks at Beaver Brook have gotten much better at this, but it nevertheless left me feeling slightly dissatisfied when I closed page #56.
