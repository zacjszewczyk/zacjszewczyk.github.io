"Since my early twenties, I've looked at my older peers and tried to figure out why some stagnate and how others stay vibrant."  

While Matt Might goes on to propose that "comfort breeds technical fossilization" and thus leads many writers to stagnate as time goes by, I would instead suggest that the blame should go to stagnation itself as both the cause and effect rather than simply the effect of growing comfortable, for through the door propped open by a lack of desire to try new and daring things waltzes stagnation and then ruin, unchecked and uninhibited by the rolling tides of innovation seeking to drown both. Matt Might's article *12 resolutions for programmers* goes on to propose a number of other activities designed to keep those tides rolling, and in doing so perpetuate that all-important desire to create and innovate.
