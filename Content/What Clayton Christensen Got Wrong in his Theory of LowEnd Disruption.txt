Another great article by Ben Thompson, this time on Clay Christensen's interesting disruption theories and Apple's approach in making products that both defy them and motivate people to purchase en masse. Come for the insights into Apple, and stay for his dissection of Christensen's widely-regarded theory; this article is well worth the read.
