This is absolutely incredible. Using only JavaScript to manage the toggles, [Julian Garnier](https://twitter.com/JulianGarnier) made this fantastic interactive solar system powered by nothing more than CSS and some HTML structure code. Even cooler, it's not just a pretty animation: it has a lot of interesting information to show as well. Awesome.
