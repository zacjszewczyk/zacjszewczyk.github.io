By far and away the best article from Ben Thompson in quite some time, reminiscent of his past [three-part series on the future of news and newspapers](https://stratechery.com/2014/newspapers-are-dead-long-live-journalism/). I have paid too little attention to this issue to have formed any sort of opinion on it, but based on this piece I would agree with Ben: it seems like book publishers made a ill-fated deal, Amazon has come to collect, and it's far too late to go back on it now.
