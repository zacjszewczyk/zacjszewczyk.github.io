"Build a Large Readership and Earn Your First Dollar"--it's a goal everyone that writes on the internet strives for, but few know how to reach. Wired Writers Guild features lessons and articles designed to provide that information. Although I'm only on day three of their daily series, I have already started benefiting from them: their second issue, asking me to formalize my motivations to write and the audience I wish to target, prompted me to think long and hard about these topics and ultimately resulted in [*Me the Writer*](Me the Writer.txt), which kicked off a number of changes including the cessation of my newsletter and a minor redesign. If you can't get in to [NextDraft and TabDump](Next Draft.txt), or even if you can and you want a really great writing resource at your disposal, I strongly encourage you to check Wired Writers Guild out.
