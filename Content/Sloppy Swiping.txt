Like Josh, I prefer to navigate with swipes rather than taps. However, unlike him, I prefer tidy swiping--that is, I prefer my apps not to register my gestures unless I begin them in certain areas, such as the extreme left side of the screen: whenever I want to go back in an app's visual hierarchy, for example, I put my finger up against my case's left bumper and swipe across; it would be confusing and annoying if I made an accidental rightward swipe and unintentionally moved back a screen. I do recognize the value of sloppy swiping, though; the key, then, is to strike a balance between the two. Even if that balance is struck though, there's a discoverability problem with gestures that you just don't have with buttons: you can see a button, while gestures are invisible.
