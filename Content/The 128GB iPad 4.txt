Having [just](Cabin Porn.txt) [finished](The Patron Saint of Cabin Porn.txt) [going](Glass Lodge.txt) [through](Another Cabin Porn Update.txt) [every](Sharecropper's Cabin.txt) [article](Yukon Territory.txt) [posted](This Must Be the Place.txt) to Cabin Porn over the last four years, I thought it would be appropriate to take a step back, shift gears quickly, and write some observations about a rumor that has quickly gained a lot of traction over the past few hours. I am, of course, referring to the rumor of a 128GB iPad 4. As I thought more and more about it though, as I read [9to5 Mac's coverage of the rumor](http://9to5mac.com/2013/01/27/apple-ready-to-release-additional-ipad-model-likely-128gb-version/), [John Gruber's take](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/28/gurman-128), and [potential substantiation by The Verge shortly thereafter](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3926532/5th-generation-ipad-part-potentially-revealed-in-leaked-image), and as I watched [A day in the life from Whole Larder Love](http://vimeo.com/52357425), the realization that the iPad 4 rumor was not what I wanted to write about slowly dawned on me. I suppose in order to give that epiphany any degree of substance I should provide some background.  

I have been writing about one form of technology or another ever since I can remember. My first website, in fact, which I refuse to link every time I reference it out of a mixture of embarrassment and wonder that sometime so contrived could have ever been published to the internet, was about making websites. Ever since that first blog, I have written about technology with a particular focus on computers. Only recently, with the launch of this site, did I enter in to the reporting space, viewing it as the next logical step in my career as a blogger. The last few weeks, however, have seen my interests begin to shift. The culmination of this shift, I thought, was the number of posts I made over the past two days. Turns out--*turns out*, as Marco is so fond of saying--I was wrong: the culmination was not the series of posts and articles about cabins, but instead my choice not to write about the 128GB iPad 4 rumor.  

So if you're still here for that you might as well leave: I have nothing to say. Nothing to say about that anyways.  

I suppose this transition was a long time coming, now that I think about it. For quite some time I have been fascinated with initiatives like YouTube Friday from Shawn Blanc, the most recent installment of which, [Those Who Make](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/01/those-who-make/), has continued to fascinate me for nearly a week with thought-provoking videos from--you guessed it--those who make things. Similarly, Ben Brooks's departure from the tech reporting norm expected of Apple bloggers and successful venture into product reviews such as [his excellent knife analysis](http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/knife-follow-up/) also captured my attention, as did Marco's entrance into this space as well. [Tools & Toys](http://toolsandtoys.net/), a gadget and software review site Shawn Blanc runs, is the most recent example of this. All these ventures have one thing in particular in common: they are all a departure from the traditional, from "the tech reporting norm expected of Apple bloggers".  

I want to join Shawn, Ben, and Marco. I don't want to be the next John Gruber with my linked list and succinct, witty quips. Not that there's anything bad with that approach, that's just not what I want from this website. No, I want this website to be something different, something out of the ordinary. I don't want this website to be just another linkblog, pushing out post after post with my nuance opinion on an over-analyzed topic, merely parroting the thoughts and ideas of the bloggers I follow and admire. I want this blog to be an outlier, the one that bucks the trend; something extraordinary.  

*Keep in mind that I wrote this post last night before Apple officially announced the 128GB iPad 4. At that time it was still an unsubstantiated rumor.*
