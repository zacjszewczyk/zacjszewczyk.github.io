Just before the iPhone event last week, [I linked to](iPhone Pricing.txt) an excellent piece by Ben Thompson titled [*Thinking About iPhone Pricing*](http://stratechery.com/2013/thinking-about-iphone-pricing/). A day after the event, he posted another article, [*Two Minutes, Fifty-Six Seconds*](http://stratechery.com/2013/two-minutes-fifty-six-seconds/), this time explaining Apple's reasoning behind pricing the 5C at $549. I really enjoyed both articles; Ben Thompson's intelligence, insight, and storytelling ability is only rivaled by a few.
