[As I have said before](Linear Python.txt), I believe in premature optimization. It leads to better products in the long run, and if optimized along the proper vectors, more secure ones, too. It's nice to see that [Oleksandr Kaleniuk agrees](https://medium.com/@okaleniuk/premature-optimization-is-the-root-of-all-evil-is-the-root-of-evil-a8ab8056c6b).
