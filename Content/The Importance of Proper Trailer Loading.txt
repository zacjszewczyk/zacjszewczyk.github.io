I see [U-Haul's video on the importance of proper trailer loading](https://youtu.be/fWd8ml9mFMo) resurface every once in a while, and most recently at [Jalopnik](https://jalopnik.com/this-demonstration-shows-why-proper-trailer-loading-is-1838296236). I [do my best](Building My 4Runner Sleeping Platform.txt) to avoid [trailers](Expedition Rigs.txt). I don't even like pulling them on paved roads, and off-road, they make all but the easiest tracks impossible. If you get stuck using one, though, at least know how to load it.
