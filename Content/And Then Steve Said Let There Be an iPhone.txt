As a rule I try not to link an article unless I have something meaningful to add to the surrounding conversation, and especially in cases where all the popular tech sites have already picked up said article. Occasionally, in exceptional circumstances I break that rule however, as I couldn't help but link Fred Vogelstein's New York Times piece chronicling the advent of the first iPhone. An exceptional read, to put it lightly.
