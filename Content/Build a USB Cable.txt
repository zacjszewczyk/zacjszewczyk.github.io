Josef Adamcik wrote a neat how-to on building a custom USB cable. It looks great. I can see myself doing something like this, maybe for [my RV build](/projects.html#lmtvRV)--[building my own keyboard](https://josef-adamcik.cz/electronics/buiding-a-custom-keyboard-katana60.html), though, not so much. Still, interesting stuff.
