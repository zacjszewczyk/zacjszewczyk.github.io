Happy May, everyone. As Spring begins to finally come to the States, we approach the season of outdoor activities--hiking, camping, picnics, and the like. And maybe, if you're lucky enough to have one, a few weekends getting away from it all in a relaxingly isolated cabin out in the woods somewhere.  

Swiss Family Robinson, anyone? I would mind getting stranded on an island so much less if I got to live in a treehouse like [this one](http://cabinporn.com/post/82903227051/towering-treehouse-in-the-hills-north-of-santa) north of Santa Cruz in California; so cool. If only I had a big enough tree in my backyard...  

Not to be outdone, one of the largest cities in the Czech Republic, Brno, features a neat hanging [pod treehouse](http://cabinporn.com/post/83114851163/treehouse-in-brno-czech-republic-contributed-by) of sorts. Reminds me of [these accommodations](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1391089/Is-dangerous-campsite-world-Pitching-tent-4-000ft-cliff-face.html), except you would have to be slightly less insane to spend a few nights here.  

In stark contrast to the previous two airborne quarters, visitors to [this shepherd's shelter in the Pyr&#233;n&#233;es](http://cabinporn.com/post/82998629719/a-toue-shepherds-shelter-in-the-pyrenees) literally live under a rock for the duration of their stay. I'd love to spend a night hanging from a cliff, don't get me wrong--I think it would be an amazing experience--but I would definitely feel safer here.  

Now this is just awesome: a [hut in Valais, Switzerland](http://cabinporn.com/post/84139004370/mountaineers-hut-in-valais-switzerland) perched atop an what looks like a precarious rock outcropping, surrounded by nothing but snow and other mountains. Looks like someone decided to commemorate [the Grinch's change of heart](http://afanyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/seuss_crumpet.jpg).  

If you look closely enough, you can see Hansel and Gretel in the distance walking towards what must be the evil witch's house. Or at least, that's exactly what [this mill-turned-cabin](http://cabinporn.com/post/83536928947/a-magical-cabin-converted-from-a-watermill-by-a) looks like, sans the candy anyway. Dark, forbidding, rustic, and completely awesome.
