"All we can really gleam from this new footage is this: Thor has a problem. Loki has some knowledge of how to fix that problem. The two team up. After that, it's all Thor swaggering, Loki sneering, and the two doing a whole bunch of fantasy-themed ass-kicking." 

What more do we need? I, for one, am *extremely* excited to see this movie come November. The first fell short in many, many areas, but after The Avengers and its phenomenal success I have high hopes for this sequel.
