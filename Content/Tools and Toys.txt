A very cool website Shawn Blanc runs along with a small staff of other writers from around the internet. I first learned of Tools & Toys in episode #25 of the CMD+SPACE podcast, [*A 'Full-Time' Masterclass, with Shawn Blanc*](http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/1/23/026-a-full-time-masterclass-with-shawn-blanc.html), and then spent some time earlier this afternoon taking a cursory look at the group's work. Not surprisingly, it's top-notch.
