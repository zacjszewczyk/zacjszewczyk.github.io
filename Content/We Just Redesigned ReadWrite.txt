ReadWrite's new site looks fantastic, very reminiscent of Digg's current design.

> "It would have been easy at that point to rest on our laurels. But we and our colleagues at Say Media, our parent company, whose technology and design teams worked tirelessly on this launch, wanted to keep pushing our design forward and drop the remnants of the '90s-era Web that clung to our site."

Good for them.
