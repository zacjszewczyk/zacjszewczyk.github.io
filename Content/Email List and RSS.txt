For anyone that hasn't already read Rich Stevens' post announcing his new email list and RSS feed, what better way could one possibly introduce something? So exceptionally well done; I look forward to more great work in this new medium.

> "I need to keep a record of what I'm thinking about and might as well share it with folks who might be interested. It'll be thoughts on staying alive as a nerd on the internet. A little business, a little gadgetry, a little art and writing, and a few dick jokes. It'll probably be 1-2 posts a week until it's done. Hoping to do the first one tomorrow."
