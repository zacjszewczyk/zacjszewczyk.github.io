Great piece from Ben Thompson on Satya Nadella's recent ascension to power over at Microsoft. Although I have not followed this saga closely--a fancy way of saying that I just don't care--I found Ben's thoughts on the topic, as usual, very interesting. Perhaps one day we will look back on this day as the turning point after which Microsoft started an upwards trend of relevance, profitability, and innovation. Perhaps, but I'm not getting my hopes up.
