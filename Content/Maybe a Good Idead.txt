I agree with Kev, that readers should have the ability to view my work in whatever format they please, but I still truncate the posts in my RSS feed. Here's why:

Whenever I find a new [writer](My Evening Reads.txt), I go through everything they have ever written--turns out, good writers write good things often; this helps me find great works from their past. RSS feeds with, say, the site's ten most recent posts make this much harder than ones with every article in them, so when [I restarted this site](Before Now and Future.txt), I took the latter route. Over a thousand posts would make my feed a hefty __ MB, though, so truncating the individual posts allowed me to strike a nice balance between the two.
