It has been quite a while since I posted one of these--more than a month, in fact: the last came out at [the beginning of May](Cabin Porn Roundup 414.txt). Today, I finally have cause to bring this series back. Finally--far too long has passed during which I had no cause to sit down and revel in the simple beauty of nature and its rustic inhabitants.

So let's start with [a quaint hut near Kahurangi National Park, New Zealand](http://cabinporn.com/post/86501972746/adelaide-tarn-hut-near-kahurangi-national-park). As is often the case with many of these cabins, the scenery surrounding this little structure vastly outclasses the small building at its heart; beautiful. And those mountains--they just beg to be climbed. I could have a *lot* of fun here.

Another small cabin that, like the previous entry, sits on the shore of a lake. This one, however, hails from the [Stockholm archipelago in Sweden](http://cabinporn.com/post/87631807475/boat-house-in-stockholm-archipelago-sweden). It reminds me of a friend's cabin in northern Minnesota, albeit his was slightly larger than this one, and set slightly farther back from the shore. Ah, the good times we had there.

Significantly closer to me than both the last two, this [abandoned cabin southeast of Salt Lake City, Utah](http://cabinporn.com/post/88406543967/abandoned-cabin-southeast-of-salt-lake-city-utah), is just incredible. I can't quite decide if it is the mountains rising up to the cabin's left and right or the backdrop of pine trees that make it so appealing to me, but regardless I would love to happen upon this one when out on a hike.

[Scott's Cabin](http://cabinporn.com/post/88393708085/scotts-cabin-beaver-brook-ny-contributed) located in Beaver Brook, NY, where the editors of Cabin Porn live. A better, larger image can be found at [Beaver Brook's tumblr page](http://beaverbrook.com/post/88393649009/scotts-cabin), but you don't have to go there to appreciate the simple beauty of this neat cabin.

When I think of New York, I picture skyscrapers and traffic--anything but the rustic cabins I link to in these posts, really. But maybe that's why Ben Dickson decided to build [a backyard "tea shed"](http://cabinporn.com/post/89108493870/backyard-tea-shed-in-clinton-hill-brooklyn) in the heart of Brooklyn.

I have always wanted to take a long hiking trip in the winter. A few summers ago I spent a week on the Appalachian trail, but as of yet have not spent any time out in all but the most clement of weather. [This log cabin in the Eastern Sayan Mountains of Siberia](http://cabinporn.com/post/88994321305/log-cabin-in-eastern-sayan-mountains-siberia) reminds me of that desire every time I see it. Perhaps someday; until then, though, it's great to have something to keep that wish at the forefront of my mind.

Not much of [a cabin](http://cabinporn.com/post/90060317355/jackal-hut-rocky-mountains-colorado) to look at, from what we can see here anyway, but with a sky like this who needs to keep their eyes turned anywhere but skyward? More beautiful scenery from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado--I would love to visit there one day.

It's sights like [this one on the Lago General Carrera river in Chilean Patagonia](http://cabinporn.com/post/89757711805/abandoned-a-frames-in-lago-general-carrera) that make me want to drop everything, load a backpack, and spend a long, long time backpacking in different places across the world in search of a much simpler, less stressful life. Give me one of these alongside a river like this and I would be happy.

This time from one of my favorite new sites, Bless This Stuff, [Casa Till](http://www.blessthisstuff.com/stuff/living/living-space/casa-till-by-wmr-architects/). My dream house would be slightly less gaudy, but I definitely would not turn down some time here.

So there you have it, nine neat cabins and otherwise cool structures set amidst beautiful scenery. It's great to be back.
