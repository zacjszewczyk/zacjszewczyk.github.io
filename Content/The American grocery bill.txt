Fascinating look at the percentage of household income various countries spend on groceries each year. Surprisingly, that number has steadily decreased over the past thirty years. In response to Businessweek's chart, on display at the beginning of The Typist's article, The Atlantic wrote [a great, in-depth piece](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/cheap-eats-how-america-spends-money-on-food/273811/) taking the discussion a few steps farther. Even if you only have a passing interest in this subject, I encourage you to check these articles out; great stuff.
