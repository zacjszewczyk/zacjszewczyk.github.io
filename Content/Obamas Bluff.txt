"That's the danger of bluffing in anything--you better be 100% certain you aren't called, or willing to take the risk you are. I think it is clear this was a bluff on Obama's part. Right or wrong Obama has now been called. There is very little choice for the United States now--because either hard line statements from our President no longer carry weight, or we go to war (of some scale)."  

I looked forward to hearing Ben Brooks' thoughts on this topic all throughout the process of writing [*Syrian Waves*](Syrian Waves.txt); he didn't disappoint.
