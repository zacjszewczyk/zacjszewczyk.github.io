Always interesting to read about another writer's tools and setup, and Matt Gemmell's style makes this piece all the more pleasurable to read.  

    "What you're seeing through the window is Outside. Now, I'm not a massive fan of Outside, generally speaking - I'm of the belief that we coped with Outside for a long time, until we finally invented Inside, and then breathed a huge sigh of relief - but it can really clear your head and restore some perspective. And sanity. And apparently vitamin D, or something, but health is a worry for tomorrow."
