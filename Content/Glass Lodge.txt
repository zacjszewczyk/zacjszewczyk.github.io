To once again reference Ben Brooks's article [*Fatal Design Flaw of Workspaces*](http://brooksreview.net/2013/01/design-workspace/), he described his ideal workspace towards the end of the article:

> "I often dream of my ideal workspace:
> * 10,000 square foot space of nothing.
> * Four foot by ten foot desk in the center, made of wood.
> * Herman Miller Embody chair.
> * Concrete floors.
> * No windows.
> * Thirty foot ceiling.
> * Spot light illuminating only my desk.
> * Just the laptop on the desk.
> * No cables in sight."

As I read this description, I couldn't help but think about how different my own ideal workspace would be from this one. Where he dreams of a large expanse of nothing, dark except for well-lit area around his immaculate desk, I idealize a small cabin like the glass lodge linked at the top of this post: a bright, cozy space, isolated somewhere away from civilization where I can be alone to work. I suppose in that regard, at least, we can agree.
