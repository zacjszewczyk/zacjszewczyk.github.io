Marco Arment, writing in response to a Hacker News commenter questioning the effectiveness of Apple punditry changing minds within the corporation:  

    "I've heard a number of times in the last few years that something I wrote was circulated within Apple or brought up in an internal discussion, usually to support one side of a debate. And it's very unlikely that Marco.org is the only site that Apple employees read."  

That's pretty awesome.
