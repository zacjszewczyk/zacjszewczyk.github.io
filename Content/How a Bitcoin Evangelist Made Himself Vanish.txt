Nathaniel Popper, writing for the New York Times, explains the extreme steps Jameson Lopp took to hide his personal information. An interesting piece, it reminded me of a great article Evan Ratlif wrote for Wired in 2009 titled [*Gone Forever: What Does It Take to Really Disappear?*](https://www.wired.com/2009/08/gone-forever-what-does-it-take-to-really-disappear/). I also rediscovered [the interview with Matt Sheppard](https://www.wired.com/2009/08/evans-interview-with-matthew-sheppard-about-disappearing-its-like-dying/) that Evan mentioned at the end of his article, as well as his follow-up piece where [he attempted to disappear and offered a $5,000 bounty for his sighting](https://www.wired.com/2009/08/author-evan-ratliff-is-on-the-lam-locate-him-and-win-5000/). These articles sent me down a fascinating rabbit hole, into the world of faked deaths and mysterious disappearances. Some of the best pieces I found: [*Here's the Best Way to Fake Your Death*](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyj8a4/heres-the-best-way-to-fake-your-death), by Mack Lamoureux on Vice; [*How I faked my own death*](https://nypost.com/2016/08/07/how-i-faked-my-own-death/), by Dean Balsimini on the New York Post; and [*The hardest part about faking your own death is staying dead*](https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2017-12-16-the-hardest-part-about-faking-your-own-death-is-staying-dead/) by Paige Nick on The New York Times Live. With Gerald Cotten's sudden disappearance, we may have a recent example of this happening again. Trista Kelley has a good writeup over [at Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/quadriga-ceo-gerald-cotten-death-with-no-access-to-crypto-gets-weirder-2019-2). I find all of this fascinating.
