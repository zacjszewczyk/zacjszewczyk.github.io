I spent enough time Internet-less this holiday season that I had a chance to catch up on a few administrative tasks. One of those involved updating [*Keeping Up with Current Events*](My Morning Reads.txt) and [*My Evening Reads*](My Evening Reads.txt) to reflect new sites, feeds, and newsletters I now follow, as well as those I no longer read. I work hard to educate myself and stay informed, and I encourage you to check those posts out as a great starting point to doing the same for yourself.
