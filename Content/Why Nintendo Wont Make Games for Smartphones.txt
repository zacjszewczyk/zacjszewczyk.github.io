The temptation certainly exists to criticize Satoru Iwata and his decision not to bring the company's most popular titles to mobile gaming platforms like iOS; however, looking beyond our disappointment at being unable to play Pokemon and Mario Kart on the iPhone, we can look at the situation dispassionately and draw a number of parallels between Nintendo and Apple, Satoru Iwata and Steve Jobs: both men led (and lead) their respective corporations with a complicated, long-term vision for success. As the sole possessor of this grand master plan, Iwata's decisions, like Jobs's, sometimes seem nonsensical and even cryptic, in a way.
