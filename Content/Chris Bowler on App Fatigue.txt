In the wake of iOS 7's release very few developers skipped the godsend of an opportunity to update their apps and charge once more in the process. Unfortunately, interspersed amongst the Tapbots of Apple's ecosystem who shipped a product rebuilt from the ground up, others instead chose a shallow strategy Ben Brooks quantified quite well in the title of his article linking to Chris's piece, [*Let's make it 2.0 so we can charge for it again.*](http://brooksreview.net/2013/11/lets-make-it-2-0-so-we-can-charge-for-it-again/) Like Chris, I had no problem paying for Tweetbot 3; I happily bought Instacast 4 when it came out too. But by and large those two were the exceptions, not the rule.
