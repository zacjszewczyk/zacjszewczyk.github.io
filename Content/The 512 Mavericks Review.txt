Amidst all the hubbub that invariably follows every Apple event as embargoes lift and reviews flood the internet, as writers formulate, present, and respond to thoughts and opinions regarding Apple's latest moves, it's easy to lose a diamond in the rough. The problem is further compounded when amongst other diamonds, to continue stretching this metaphor, such as John Siracusa's famous [Mavericks review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/). Such was the case when Stephen Hackett posted his own article reviewing OS X 10.9, which I just now got around to reading more than two weeks after its publication. While it will not replace John's in-depth analysis and historical perspective I enjoy so much, Stephen's much quicker pace and more jovial approach did earn his annual review a spot among those I will look out for and read every year from here on out.
