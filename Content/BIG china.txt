I took some time to [update](Updates To My Morning And Evening Reads.txt) [*Keeping Up with Current Events*](My Morning Reads.txt) and [*My Evening Reads*](My Evening Reads.txt) over the holidays, which involved adding Matt Stoller's excellent newsletter *BIG* to the list of sources that help me stay informed. His most recent issue, [*Trump's Surprising Embrace of Industrial Policy to Fight China*](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/trumps-surprising-embrace-of-industrial), is a prime example of the shrewd analysis that makes it so interesting. This issue is a great way to start the new year, and new subscribers will find his roundup of 2019's best posts at its beginning helpful, too.
