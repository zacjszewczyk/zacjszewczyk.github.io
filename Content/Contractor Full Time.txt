As usual, an interesting article from Sam Dogen at Finaicial Samurai. Especially within this microcosm of independent app developers and writers, it has become so common to hear the story of a full-time employee striking out on his own that this piece nearly took me by surprise: rather than leaving his large company and setting up a one-man shop, Sam is considering returning to the corporate nine-to-five lifestyle he left in 2012. Even more interestingly, his reasons make a lot of sense. I would love to go independent at some point in my life, but there is certainly some appeal to being a corporate stooge.
