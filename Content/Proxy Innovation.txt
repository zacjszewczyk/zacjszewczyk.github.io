World powers have a penchant for proxy wars. French involvement in the Revolutionary War, anyone? [Little has changed a century and a half later](https://www.rbth.com/history/329015-top-3-unknown-proxy-wars). We still see this going on [today](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/05/proxy-wars-are-never-moral/) in [Syria](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-states-are-turning-proxy-war-29677), to name just one recent example. We also see this going on today in the fifth domain--cyberspace--with [the rise of the Chinese firm Huawei](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/). Although some experts [argue that the Communist Party does not control it](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/07/we-cant-tell-if-chinese-firms-work-for-the-party/), [recent Justice Department actions paint a different picture](https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-foreign-power-or-agent-foreign-power-under-fisa-insights-sanctions-case), and those who would know [believe that the Party does](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-former-military-and-intelligence-officials-letter-5g-risks). Regardless of that speculation, though, none argue that the company owes its fantastic success--at least in part--to the tremendous support of the Chinese government. Those ties have caused the United States' government to array itself against Huawei, which will [likely translate into direct support](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/05/in-trumps-economy-the-invisible-hand-belongs-to-the-government/) for its competitors.

Here we see yet another example of a proxy war, except this time in a whole new domain. China used Huawei to assert its dominance over a technology that Keith Johnson and Elias Groll [described](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/) as "the central nervous system of the 21st-century economy"; the United States will likely attempt--in a much less subtle way--to win out with a company of its own choosing. And so the proxy wars will continue.
