I have spent the last two or three months occasionally hearing Aaron Mahnke and Dave Caolo talk about an app capable of completely cutting a computer off from a certain set of domains as a means to increase productivity. By making it impossible for one to get distracted, the creators of the aptly-named SelfControl reason, productivity must increase accordingly. I downloaded SelfControl Sunday night, and even in my brief experience with it so far I can attest to its effectiveness.  

After my [disavowal of gaming](Disavow Gaming.txt) I wanted an insurance policy, something I could fall back on if boredom struck and my resolve faded. Thanks to Dave and Aaron on [Homework](http://5by5.tv/homework) it only took me a few minutes to find, download, and open SelfControl. An open-source app aiming to remove the greatest obstacle to productive work--namely, your own resolve--SelfControl works by allowing users to define a list of sites to block and then irrevocably preventing their computers from accessing those domains for a set period of time. No amount of [terminal work](https://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ#q-i-did-some-stuff-with-the-terminal-that-i-read-on-a-cool-tech-site-but-it-didnt-work-what-do-i-do-now) can reverse this action, nor can [deleting the app](https://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ#q-i-deleted-the-application-will-that-do-anything) or even restarting your computer; once SelfControl's timer has begun its countdown, the specified domains might as well not exist.  

Personally, this is exactly what I needed. Now I not only have my own resolve to lean on, but should all else fail I have no way of falling back on my unproductive ways; now I really have absolutely no excuse.
