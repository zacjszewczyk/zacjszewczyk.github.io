At first, I thought I--[like Federico](http://www.macstories.net/linked/the-first-app-you-open-in-the-morning/)--launched Tweetbot before any other apps every morning. However, after a some thinking I realized that not to be the case: I open Facebook Messenger right out of bed to send a quick "Good morning" off to my girlfriend--because Messages never works for us--followed by Instacast while I make and eat breakfast. If I have time between breakfast and leaving for work, only then do I get to Twitter.
