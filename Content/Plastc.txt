Although I started out [confident in Coin's eventual success](Thoughts Regarding Coin.txt), I have since made no bones about my distaste for their [questionable methodologyy](Bad Coin.txt), [business model](More Coin.txt), and [apparent inability to meet deadlines](https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/509686863574343681). Burn me once, shame on you; burn me twice, though, shame on me: I'm hesitant to get behind Plastc given the apparently insurmountable challenges of this space, but that won't stop me from wishing them success. At this point, I just want to see someone make actual progress.
