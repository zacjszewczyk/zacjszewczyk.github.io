After the petition to build a Death Star and the petition to remove Ortiz from her position at the Department of Injustice (oops, a typo) all garnered the required 25,000 signatures, I suppose it's not surprising. Sam Byford has more on this in his post [*After Death Star and deportation petitions, White House raises signature threshold to 100,000*](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3881672/white-house-petition-signature-threshold-raised) on The Verge.
