Full credit to Alex Armstrong and [his helpful article](https://alexarmstrong.net/2015/01/pushing-to-multiple-git-repos) for reminding me how to do this every time I start a new project. So I can better keep track of this, though, these five lines will create a local Git repo, tie GitHub and Bitbucket remote repos to it, and then push to both.

``` shell
git init
git remote add origin {GitHub repo URL} # Get GitHub repo URL
git remote set-url --add --push origin {GitHub repo URL} # Get GitHub repo URL
git remote set-url --add --push origin {Bitbucket repo URL} # Get Bitbucket repo URL
git add .; git commit -m "Initial commit."; git push -u origin master
```

These simple commands make sure that for all my projects, I have a local copy, a local backup, a cloud backup, and two more off-site copies of all my work--just in case.
