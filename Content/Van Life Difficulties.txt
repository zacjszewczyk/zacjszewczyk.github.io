Chris Wright [does a much better job of making the point](https://www.outsideonline.com/2399404/van-life-difficulties) Anna Merlan [tried to make the other day](Vanlife Failure.txt): that you don't have to spend a bunch of money to take on the vanlife lifestyle. It helps, so you don't spend the entire journey wracked with agonizing worry like Chris did, but you can still have some awesome experiences without it.
