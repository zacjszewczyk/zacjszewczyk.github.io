I like to think about things. To riff off [Austin Kleon](Start Before You Think Youre Ready.txt), I want to become a professional writer so that I can be a professional thinker. For now, though, as I have said [many](Life is a Hallway.txt) [times](Own Your Platform.txt) [before](Expedition Rigs.txt), I write to clarify, condense, and record my thoughts. I have sat down today to talk about Tesla's new Cybertruck--not because the Internet needs [one more hot take](Hot Takes on Teslas Cybertruck.txt), but rather to pursue those goals.

I will spend little time on the boring stuff. Every website, blog, and Social Median&trade; has covered those subjects well enough by now. In brief, then: 

* **On the design**: Art is subjective, but design is objective. From the former, subjective standpoint, I see the Cybertruck as a step in [a good direction](https://gearpatrol.com/2019/11/23/can-truly-beautiful-car-designs-even-exist-anymore/); from the latter, objective point of view, I feel less certain. The Cybertruck's rigid shell and harsh angles seem to make it a crash test and pedestrian nightmare. Some middle ground must exist between the traditional aluminum and fiberglass body panels I can deform by hand, and the ultra-durable plate steel common in military vehicles, though; perhaps Tesla struck that balance. The unibody platform [makes sense](https://jalopnik.com/mid-size-trucks-dont-need-frames-1785674405), and [by](https://gearjunkie.com/tesla-cybertruck) [all](https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-impressions-ride/) [accounts](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk), the spacious interior will even appease the large market segment who prefer luxe finishes in their utility vehicles.
* **On the specs**: The Cybertruck specs are good for an electric vehicle, but mediocre for a truck--and bad at $70,000. Do not judge this polygon--with a 14,000 pound towing capacity, 3,500 pound payload, and 500 mile range--[against an entry-level, $30,000 F-150](https://jalopnik.com/heres-how-tesla-played-itself-with-the-cybertruck-vs-f-1840064923). Instead, look at the top-of-the-line, $70,000 Cybertruck versus a not-quite-top-of-the-line, $60,000 F-450. For that price, I could get a monstrous truck with a 500 mile range, that could tow over 30,000 pounds--and carry almost 8,000 pounds in its 8 foot bed--with ease. Speaking of beds, Tesla claim of 6.5 feet also bothers me:

Given that Tesla appears to have built the Cyberquad from a [Yamaha Raptor](https://www.thedrive.com/news/31175/it-looks-like-the-tesla-cyberquad-atv-is-actually-a-yamaha-raptor-underneath), which comes in at 72.6" long, I bet the *usable* bed space comes in closer to six feet--not six and a half. The Cyberquad just fits:

The Cybertruck looks cool, but has little going for it beyond that. It's a truck with near-sportscar-level performance, [but it's not a very good sportscar](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk), and it's not a very good truck. As a vehicle, then, it just doesn't interest me, for these reasons and those cited above; as a toe in the waters of a sea change, though, the garishly named Cybertruck does give me hope for a more angular future.

I despise [curvy cars](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8762373/car-design-curves). I just want a box on wheels, like a classic Toyota Land Cruiser or Land Rover Defender. Aside from a Jepp Wrangler, I got as close to that as I could with [my Toyota 4Runner](Choosing an Adventure Rig.txt). I also have no love for the fragility of modern cars. I understand the reasons for large crumple zones and lightweight materials, but delicate trim pieces degrade over time--often quickly, and seldom well. Perhaps the Cybertruck's [apparent](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/24/20980141/tesla-cybertruck-preorder-deposit-elon-musk) popularity will encourage an automaker to try something new. Besides looking good and making me happy, a Cybertruck-like design would also [slash production costs](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing)--a [win, win, win](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/08176b5a-ca96-4b82-bd15-336295ec7d14). Tesla did something good with the Cybertruck, but it did not do it well. The fact that anyone did it at all, though, does give me hope.
