I came across this story thanks to [Polygon's refutation](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/22/6053213/pokemon-black-creepypasta) of the mod's existence, but fortunately thought to read [the original article](http://tinycartridge.com/post/866743831/super-creepy-pokemon-hack) over at Tiny Cartridge first--as I would recommend you do as well. "Creepy" barely scratches the surface of this haunting tale. Especially if you, like me, grew up loving Pokemon, I encourage you to take a few minutes and read this story; it's remarkably well-done.
