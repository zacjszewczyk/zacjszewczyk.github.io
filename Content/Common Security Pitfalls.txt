Tom Smith over at DZone, one of [a handful of websites
I read every day](My Morning Reads.txt), just finished a great three-part series on common cybersecurity shortfalls.

I recommend all three: [part 1](https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-part-1), [part 2](https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-part-2), and [part 3](https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-other-part-3).
