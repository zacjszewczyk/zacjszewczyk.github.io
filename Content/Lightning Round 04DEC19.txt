I often [see articles](My Mornings Reads.txt) that I would like to talk about, but that I do not feel warrant a whole post here. Twitter is the obvious choice for quips like these, but I have little love for the service, [prefer](Own Your Platform.txt) to keep all my work [on my own platform](How to Own Your Platform.txt), and feel that nuanced opinions should not come in 280 character bursts. Occasional "lightning rounds" will fill that gap. Together, a handful of these micro posts will make a full one, giving me somewhere to share things that used to just slip through the cracks.

* [Only 9% of 15-year-olds can tell the difference between fact and opinion](https://qz.com/1759474/only-9-percent-of-15-year-olds-can-distinguish-between-fact-and-opinion/). Does the responsibility for differentiating between fact and opinion fall on the reader, or the one presenting the information? In the era of fake news, amidst a resurgence of propaganda, you may feel tempted to say it falls on the reader. Consider this, though: if I present false information as fact to you here, you cannot know it's falsehood *without doing your own, independent research*. The responsibility for differentiating between fact and opinion, then, falls on the presenter--and the reader, who has no way of knowing truth from fiction by default, has a responsibility to *verify* the presenter's claims. This is a nuanced distinction, but an important one.
* [Zuckerberg doubles down on ad policy](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3523237-zuckerberg-doubles-down-on-ad-policy). From Seeking Alpha, quoting Mark Zuckerberg: "'What I believe is that in a democracy, it's really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying, so they can make their own judgments,' he said. 'And, you know, I don't think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news.'" Facebook commands an unprecedented majority of the world's time and attention. As a result, [it may very well lead to the Second Estate's overthrow](The Internet and the Third Estate.txt). The idea that it should *also* become the arbiter of truth boggles my mind. See above. 
* [En-ROADS Interactive Climate Simulator](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.6). I would have more interest in a simulator that modeled temperature change based on the behavior of individual countries. See related: [U.S. Emissions Have Almost No Effect on Global Temperatures](Us Emissions Have No Effect On Temperatures.txt).
* [Kill Sticky Headers](https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/kill-sticky-headers/). I dislike anything that gets in the way of content. So does Alisdair McDiarmid, and so he did something about it.
