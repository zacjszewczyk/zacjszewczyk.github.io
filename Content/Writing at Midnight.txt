When I first saw this tweet roll by in my feeds either earlier this week I didn't pay much attention to it. As I sit here and it's nearly midnight, however, John Gruber's excerpt came to mind: "Midnight: Hunter ready to write." These days I have very small windows in which to write in: between homework and class during the day, and after I return home from FRC practice at 9:30 (at the earliest) each night. Outside of those small windows, which are all to frequently filled by one thing or another, I have the weekends. The weekends and midnight.
