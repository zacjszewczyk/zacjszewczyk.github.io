Thirty-eight minutes and eleven seconds in to [the eighteenth episode](http://5by5.tv/bb/18) of [The B&B Podcast](http://5by5.tv/bb/), Shawn Blanc, in response to Ben Brooks talking about the salient point of his Lion review, said, "If you can't boil down your whole article into a tweet, what are you doing writing the article in the first place?" Amidst a discussion regarding Ben and Shanw's recent Lion and Web OS reviews, respectively, this humble observation is easy to miss as its brevity belies its profundity. This modest phrase said in passing is nevertheless one of the most profound insights into the writer's craft I have ever come across.
