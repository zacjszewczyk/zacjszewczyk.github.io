I haven't read Jack Donovan's [work](http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis) or [listened](http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/podcast-2/) to [his](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-243-becoming-barbarian/) [podcasts](https://www.orderofman.com/a-more-complete-beast-jack-donovan/) in a while, so I forgot how good some of his stuff is until I re-discovered [*Violence is Golden*](http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2011/03/violence-is-golden/) this morning. From his article:

> "A rule not ultimately backed by the threat of violence is merely a suggestion. States rely on laws enforced by men ready to do violence against lawbreakers. Every tax, every code and every licensing requirement demands an escalating progression of penalties that, in the end, must result in the forcible seizure of property or imprisonment by armed men prepared to do violence in the event of resistance or non–compliance. ... Without action, words are just words. Without violence, laws are just words. Violence isn’t the only answer, but it is the final answer."

Ours is a comfortable reality--but just barely.
