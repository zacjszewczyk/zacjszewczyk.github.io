Although written in the same vein as all those articles about Tim Cook where the collective discourse was invariably framed by the comparison to Steve Jobs and his legacy, published for much too long after Tim became Apple's latest CEO, here such a format actually felt appropriate as the author--taking from Yukari Kane's upcoming book *Haunted Empire, Apple After Steve Jobs*--did so to contrast the two very different leadership styles of these two individuals. What's more, I found this brief excerpt all the more interesting as the first in-depth article I have seen about Tim Cook in particular. About time.
