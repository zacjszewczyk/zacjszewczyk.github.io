For everyone waiting on TEDx to release Ben Bratton's "[We need to talk about TED](http://www.bratton.info/projects/talks/we-need-to-talk-about-ted/)" video, here you go. [Since reading his transcript](We need to talk about ted.txt) I have kept the page open in anticipation of TEDx releasing this, and I still managed to miss it by a day. If you enjoyed the transcript, you'll love the talk.
