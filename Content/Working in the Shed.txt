When this article originally made [its](http://www.marco.org/2013/08/03/working-in-the-shed) [rounds](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/08/working-in-the-shed/), I saved it to Instapaper but put off reading the piece. With a title like "Working in the Shed", I assumed Matt Gemmell had gone off the deep end and actually taken his Macbook out into a backyard shed in an extreme attempt at curbing his Twitter addiction. Having finally gotten around to reading his excellent article though, I'm here to say that *Working in the Shed* is much, much more than an anecdote about avoiding distraction. I won't go any further though: go read the article yourself.
