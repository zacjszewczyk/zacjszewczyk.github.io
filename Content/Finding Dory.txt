"On the one hand, I worry that Pixar is making too many sequels. On the other, I'd love to see another Incredibles movie." 

Someone, somewhere, once said something to the effect of the higher the number the less-good the sequel. Certainly there are some exceptions to that rule––Toy Story, for example--but by and large it has proved a valid hypothesis. Take Cars 2: as much as I wanted to love that movie after the first, I couldn't do it. An endless number of examples and counter-examples could be made on both sides of this argument, but I, for one, look forward to anything with Pixar's name on it, regardless of whether or not a digit follows it.
