"When I communicated about concerns and issues - as well as complaints from Cryptoparty participants peeved with out-of-touch crypto-lecturers who wanted to teach command lines to crypto-newcomers - I got put downs, got brushed off, ignored, told 'oh don't worry, we'll look after it, it won't be a problem', 'don't worry your head about it', or aggravatingly - told that I wasn't qualified to judge their choices as I wasn't a crypto-expert or a hacker."  

Asher Wolf brings to light a darker side of the internet as and the hacker community in particular, chronicling her "perfect storm" experience, if you will, with misogyny in the hacker culture.
