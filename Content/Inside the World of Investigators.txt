[I'm a sucker for a good pseudocide story](How a Bitcoin Evangelist Made Himself Vanish.txt). Isabelle Kohn has a nice writeup on [the ways investigators track these people down](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/inside-the-world-of-investigators-who-know-youve-faked-your-death), and Gizmodo posted an interesting article about [the psychology of faking your own death](https://gizmodo.com/the-psychology-of-faking-your-own-death-1830022958). Back in 2009, [Howard Swains talked about this topic as well](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/reports-of-my-death). Interesting stuff.
