"Per the agreement and our promise not to screw it up, Tumblr will be independently operated as a separate business. David Karp will remain CEO. The product, service and brand will continue to be defined and developed separately with the same Tumblr irreverence, wit, and commitment to empower creators."

A lot of people have written about this announcement. They started when rumors of the acquisition began gaining significant traction yesterday and haven't stopped since. For all the long-winded articles explaining how this deal undoubtedly spells the end of Tumblr and the hissy fits of those lashing out as if anyone cares to listen though, Myke Hurley put it best in [a tweet from yesterday evening](https://twitter.com/imyke/status/336175686832246784):

> "I think it's fair to say Marissa Mayer is giving us *exactly* what we hoped.

> She is building an exciting Yahoo!"

Yahoo! under Marissa Mayer has been doing a lot of interesting things lately. She really has built an exciting Yahoo!, and one that I look forward to seeing many great things come from in the coming months and years.
