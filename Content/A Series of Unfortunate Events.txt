The controversial touchdown during the third quarter of this afternoon's Houston-Detroit football game left me shaking my head for the rest of the day. Marc Sessler summed it up perfectly in his article [*Justin Forsett, Houston Texans gifted a touchdown*](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000099065/article/justin-forsett-houston-texans-gifted-a-touchdown): the Texans certainly were gifted a touchdown, and unfortunately that touchdown gave them the edge they needed to beat Detroit in overtime.
