Absolutely hilarious video, courtesy of John Gruber--with the choice line taken as an excerpt: "Magellan Was an Explorer. Chuck Yeager Was an Explorer. You Guys Have a Fucking Camera on Your Face." I was rather bullish on the widespread reaction to Google Glass the other day when I wrote [Thoughts on Glass](Thoughts on Glass.txt), but I can still appreciate some great humor when I see it. Very well done.
