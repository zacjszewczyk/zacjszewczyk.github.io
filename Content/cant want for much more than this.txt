"As I fill the last jar with sweet summer pears I ponder for a second. Why do all this work when I could buy it? Well the truth is I don't like money. I'm not good with it. Thats why I'd rather work for my food. I know I'll never be a rich man, I'll never own anything of great expense, but I have everything I need, I don't want for much more than this. I have pears in a jar."
