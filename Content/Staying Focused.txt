Leo Babauta, in [*Staying Focused with a Simple Method*](https://zenhabits.net/simple-focus/):

> "When you notice yourself avoiding something hard or uncertain ... the method is to turn towards it. Turn towards what you’re avoiding. Open to the discomfort, embrace it as training and growth. Bring curiosity. Do it even when you don’t feel like it. This is the training. The simple method makes it easier. Take it on, and see what happens."

As [I have said before](Showing Up.txt), and will keep on saying, there is no shortcut, life hack, or trick; grind.
