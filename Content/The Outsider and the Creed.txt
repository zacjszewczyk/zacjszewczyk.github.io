Turns out you are not the only one battling with a lack of conviction in your own self worth and the value of the things you create, and struggling with the fear that at any moment someone might discover that you are, in fact, the fraud you so strongly believe yourself to be. In reality, we all struggle with these complicated feelings--you, me, and I would bet anything your role model does as well. In the somber words of [Raymond Reddington](http://the-blacklist.wikia.com/wiki/Raymond_Reddington) though, "There will be nightmares. And every day when you wake up, it will be the first thing you think about. Until one day, it will be the second thing." Although at the time he referred to something much darker than the purely psychological impostor syndrome, his words apply here as well: these misgivings will plague you from the moment you wake up [in the middle of the night](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/02/20/om) to the second you fall back into a fitful sleep. Until one day, they will not.
