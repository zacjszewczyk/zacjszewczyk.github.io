Another week has gone by, made all the better with a few great podcasts. This time around, Roderick on the Line makes another appearance, and is accompanied by a great episode of Systematic and a fantastic episode of Zac & Co. Enjoy.

[Roderick on the Line Episode 127: Fermi in a Van](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-127-fermi-in-a-van.html). It's no wonder that the only way kids learn these days--or at least, the best way kids learn these days--involves increasing levels of technological involvement. From computers to infinitely personal iPads, we have taken these tools from a way to learn better and made it the only way our kids know how. But maybe they don't need laptops, tablets, and smartphones in middle school; maybe, the solution is to give everyone a clarinet.

[Systematic Episode 117: Reluctant Selfies with Virginia Roberts](http://5by5.tv/systematic/117). I didn't know what to expect going in to this episode, but Brett and Virginia had some very interesting thoughts to share on dating, parenting, and discipline in particular.

[Zac & Co Episode 2: The Moment He Makes The Choice](http://constellation.fm/shows/zac/002). To even list the topics Ben Alexander and Zac Cichy talked about here would be to do this episode a huge disservice, so I won't. Instead, I'll say this: two incredibly smart people got together to talk about some really interesting things in a conversation that I found riveting.
