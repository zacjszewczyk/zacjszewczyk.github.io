I saw a similar post to this one a few days ago about Microsoft called [*Fail Fail Fail iPad*](http://gravitationalpull.net/wp/?p=2312) on Gravitational Pull, using preductions from years long past that coincidentally fit current events to predict the eventual demise of Microsoft. Both articles were wrong.
