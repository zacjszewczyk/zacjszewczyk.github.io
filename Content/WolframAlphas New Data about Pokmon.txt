I would have loved to have this back when I played Pokmon LeafGreen and Pokmon Saphire. Instead I had Prima Games' [*Pokmon Pokedex Collector's Edition*](http://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Pokedex-Collectors-Edition-Official/dp/0761547614/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382496492&sr=8-1&keywords=pokedex+collectors+edition) which, although a great book for its time, simply cannot compare to the power Wolfram|Alpha will afford its users. I don't even play the game any more and I'm still excited.
