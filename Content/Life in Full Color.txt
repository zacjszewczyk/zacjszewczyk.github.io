Another article I glossed by a few weeks ago only to come back to it as the clock strikes midnight.

> "The changes to my working (and sleeping) routine have forced me to write when it's time to write, not when I feel inspired."

At the time I didn't understand the concept of writing when it was time to write rather than when I felt inspired, which is why I didn't pay a great deal of attention to this article when Shawn Blanc first released it. At the time, I wrote when I felt inspired, not when it was time to write. At the time, there was no specific time to write, all the time was the time to write. And then my schedule got busy, and now I stay up late to write because it's what I love to do. Now I write when it's time to write.
