"As soon as I lose pride in something, I stop caring about it being good. Its only value to me is as something that I one day won't have to do anymore. It always starts with the cutting of one small corner, but that's all it takes. Pandora's Box is open and the feature is infected. I cut the next corner with only a faint pang of remorse, and after that I don't even notice the corners anymore."

A great article and an astute observation not only applicable in the professional world, but throughout our lives as well.
