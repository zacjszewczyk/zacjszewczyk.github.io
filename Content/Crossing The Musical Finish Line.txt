If you scrolled past Linus Edwards's latest article [for some reason](https://twitter.com/andrewjclark/status/428650506622226432), disinterested in the topic of music and his thoughts on the subject, 1) you're wrong, go read it anyway; it's great, and b) after you have read through it once, go back, replace "music" with "idea", and it suddenly becomes even more impactful.
