Started cutting on a Sunday, and finished the following Friday. Didn't spend all day everyday on it, but definitely spent more time than I thought I would. If you just worked on it straight, you could probably finish in a weekend, though.  

The final product:

Both drawers lock in and lock out. I have a bunch of camping stuff in the right drawer.

You can open one at a time, or both.

The left drawer is shorter, height-wise, than the right, because the gray platform of top is sized for a cooler. I wanted to be able to get into the cooler while driving. The cooler sits on top, and underneath it is a little camp stove.

The camp stove slides out so you can get into the cooler and cook at the same time.

You can also fold the seats down and extend a sleeping platform, so you don't have to pitch a tent if you don't want to. Just sleep in the car.

You'll be on a slight incline, but it's comfy.

And if you have to take passengers, you can have either sleeping platform laid down with the other row of seats up. Here the left platform is down with the right seats up.

And if you need all the seats, you can do that too. Just fold up both sleeping platforms.
