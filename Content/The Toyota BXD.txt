Patrick George over at Jalopnik [posted a picture](https://jalopnik.com/i-ve-been-thinking-about-picking-up-an-old-4runner-or-l-1837864980) of a Toyota BXD20 the other day, and I had to check it out. Kinja [had a nice article about the vehicle](https://oppositelock.kinja.com/m-e-g-a-the-rarest-toyota-on-this-side-of-the-world-a-1822806540). I would not say no to a BXD, but given the chance to build on a platform like this, I would just go with a similar AM General Humvee. AM General has built almost 10,000 per year since 1984 for militaries around the world, which has proven the vehicle's reliability and made it readily available for cheap. With a few modifications, like [locking differentials](https://www.flashoffroad.com/Improvements/Lockers/Eaton/EatonLockers.htm), I would have a similar rig for much less time and money.
