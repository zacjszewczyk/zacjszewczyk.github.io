Another interesting piece, among [several others](Engineering Blogs.txt), on encouraging writing within an organization. As I prepare to move on to a new role, I'm happy to report that my team's efforts to publish an internal written product on a regular schedule has gone well so far. I hope it continues in my absence, and I look forward to starting a similar project with my next team.
