From Simon Pitt [over at OneZero](https://onezero.medium.com/the-death-of-the-computer-file-doc-43cb028c0506), emphasis mine:

> "The other day, I came across a website I'd written over two decades ago. I double-clicked the file, and it opened and ran perfectly. Then I tried to run a website I'd written 18 months ago and found I couldn't run it without firing up a web server, and when I ran NPM install, one or two of those 65,000 files had issues that meant node failed to install them and the website didn't run. When I did get it working, it needed a database. And then it relied on some third-party APIs and there was an issue with CORS because I hadn't whitelisted localhost. My website made of files carried on, chugging along. **This isn't me saying that things were better in the old days. I'm just saying that years ago websites were made of files; now they are made of dependencies.**"

Call me old-fashioned, but I do think things were better in the old days, [so I'll stick to static files and vanilla Python for my projects](/projects.html#firstCrack).
