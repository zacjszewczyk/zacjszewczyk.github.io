"If computers are analogous to powered flight, we are four and a half years after the Wright Brothers flew at Kittyhawk; we are still flying airplanes made out of bicycle parts."

This was merely the first of the near innumerable excerpts I wanted to pull out if CMD+SPACE's twenty-eight episode [Technology and Music, with John Roderick](http://thebroshow.libsyn.com/028-technology-and-music-with-john-roderick). For the rest of them though, check out this excellent podcast hosted by Myke Hurley of [70 Decibels](http://www.70decibels.com/). Along with this great episode Myke has also interviewed a number of other popular Internet figures, including Shawn Blanc in the episode before last's, [A Full Time Masterclass with Shawn Blanc](http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/1/23/026-a-full-time-masterclass-with-shawn-blanc.html).
