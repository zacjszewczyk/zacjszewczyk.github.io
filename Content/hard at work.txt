Rohan Anderson of [Whole Larder Love](http://wholelarderlove.com) on the pursuit of happiness in a more simple life:

> "Many believe that you're supposed to find love, get married, work you butt off, earn money, own stuff, out-do your neighbours and pop out perfect kids. People that believe in this are in fact, idiots. Because that approach is not suited for everyone. From my short life I'd say life is more about experiences, love, culture, memories, achieving contentedness and if you're lucky, very lucky...finding true happiness. The latter of which is THE goal for people these days. But let's face it, it's a bit rubbish. You can't be happy all the time, not even half the time, but you can be content. And I reckon that's something worth aiming for."

One of the better articles I have read in quite some time. An excellent piece well worth the time required to appreciate it.
