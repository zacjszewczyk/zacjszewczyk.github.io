"You determine the greatness of your accomplishments by the amount of pain you're willing to pay down. The more ambitious you are, the more glass you'll have to chew. Everyone has their grind, even people doing what they love."  

A wonderfully inspirational piece from Arram Sabeti, CEO of ZeroCater, on the important role determination plays in success, especially in the face of deficiencies.
