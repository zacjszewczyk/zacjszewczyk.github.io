In a footnote to his interesting piece posted yesterday titled *Everything Else*, John Gruber made an astute observation regarding loyalty and Apple:  

    "Later in his piece, Gassee recommends that Apple engage a 'powerhouse' PR firm to help sway opinion in its favor. I'd argue that Apple already has a powerhouse PR firm, and it very successfully engages in most of the tactics Gassee speaks of. But rather than a separate company, it's completely internal to -- and thus dedicated to -- Apple."  

For some reason the importance of loyalty is lost on many today, but not Apple: Apple knows the value of loyalty, and that knowledge has certainly served them well over the years.
