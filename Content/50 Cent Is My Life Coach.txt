When Adam and Nathan talked about this article during episode seventeen of their podcast [Five More Things](http://fivemorethings.com/), [50 Cent is Actually Brilliant](http://fivemorethings.com/17), I recognized its potential value but dismissed it as largely uninteresting, and sent it away to Instapaper. Now, however, a few weeks later, I wish I had sat down and read it as soon as it came to my attention. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer: 50 Cent had some fantastic advice and shared a number of very interesting insights that I wish GQ had given Zach more time to expand upon, and perhaps even search for more of; fascinating and highly-recommended.
