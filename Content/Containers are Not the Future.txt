Ian Eyberg in [*Containers are Not the Future*](https://rap.mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm), quoting a line from [Mike Rapoport and James Bottomley's talk at this year's Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting](https://rap.mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm):

> "The kernel developers view of the docker community is that in the rare case they can actually formulate the question correctly they usually don't understand the answer."

Hilarious. Ian also got at a critical point about the state of modern software engineers, something I touched on a few weeks ago when I linked to [*Good TImes Create Weak Men*](Good Times Create Weak Men.txt). Short-term, push-button fixes attempt to get around the long, hard, and expensive problem of developing and deploying expertise. Like outsourcing, while the former approach has [short-term benefits](http://berthub.eu/articles/posts/national-outsourcing/), its [long-term effects are debilitating](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9da/f5cc1c94c6e34e29095ca168e8fa2d750df9.pdf).
