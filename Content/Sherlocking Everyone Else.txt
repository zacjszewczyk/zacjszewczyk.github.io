The last few years have seen a great proliferation of linkblogs, by far and away the most popular topic of which is technology and, specifically, Apple. Nevertheless the likes of John Gruber--who did not, despite many erroneous beliefs, invent either the format or topic--and Shawn Blanc have made their mark as entrants to a space established long before their arrival. This not only happens in the blogging space, but the podcasting industry as well where interview shows like Daniel Jalkut's *Bitsplitting* came in and *sherlocked*--ugh--the existing space, which already had *plenty* of interview programs, with a really great show.  

Over the past three weeks much has been said about the podcasting industry. [Stephen Hacket](http://512pixels.net/2013/09/because-podcasts-awesome/), [Chris Gonzales](http://unretrofied.com/blog/2013/9/26/ios-7-and-the-state-of-podcast-apps), [Federico Viticci](http://www.macstories.net/linked/ios-7-and-podcast-apps/), and [Myke Hurley](http://512pixels.net/2013/10/hurley-podcasting/) all wrote articles on this topic, but that didn't change the fact that I had something to say, and so I contributed [my two-cents as well](Podcasting State of the Union.txt). On one level I sherlocked[^1] all those other posts, and it worked fine: many loved my article, much to my delight, because I had something interesting and unique to say. Similarly, so many loved *Bitsplitting* because Daniel Jalkut took a different approach to the tried-and-true interview show format; he, too, had something interesting and unique to contribute to the overarching narrative.  

Need I continue?  

Just because an app has cornered a particular market niche, or because that market is saturated, is by no means a valid excuse not to enter it. If we applied that logic outside the realm of apps, no one would ever write anything; no new podcasts would hit the market; no one would create another blog. But that's oversimplifying the problem, as Marco said in [*Sherlocking Myself Just Fine Over Here*](http://www.marco.org/2013/10/08/sherlocking-myself): everyone brings their own nuance to bear in creation. All Apple blogs are not the same; no two to-do list apps are the same. Whether through a hundred minute design decisions or the phrasing of a paragraph, every creative product is unique in some way. The challenge, then, should not be whether to enter a market or not, but how your entrant will differentiate itself from the incumbents.
