"After 3 weeks, I'm actually leaning slightly more towards the mini if I had to pick one. Though I do work a lot from my iPad, the iPad is not my main work machine. I still spend most of my time at my desk working from my MacBook Air. And so, for the things I do use an iPad for, the iPad mini is better for about 80-percent of them and 'good enough' for the other 20-percent. I plan to keep using both iPads, side by side, for at least another month or two, so I'll check back in again soon."  

As an avid iPad user--although less so [lately after purchasing my MacBook Pro](Diary of a Convert.txt)--I have followed this discussion with great interest since the retina iPad Mini's launch. Of all the articles I have seen so far, Shawn's is one of the best.
