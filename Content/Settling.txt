Something I found in a note almost lost in the sea that is the host of half-baked ideas begging to be honed to a comprehensible piece:

> "There are a lot of things I have had to learn to be okay with over the past few weeks. Things like a much more structured day, consistent late nights out, and going to the gym less often that I would like, for example, or much less significant things like writing when I have time rather than when I want to write, or saying no to things I don't have time for, even if I've already started doing that thing I now realize I need to say no to."
