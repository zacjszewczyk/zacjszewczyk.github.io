"'A tremendous amount of work has gone into every aspect of The Loop magazine from the fonts and design, to the writers I chose to be part of it. I want readers to enjoy every single article in a clean, ad-free environment. They should look forward to every issue because the experience was so good.'"

Prior to last Thursday, The Magazine was the only item on my Newsstand bookshelf. Marco Arment finally has some company.
