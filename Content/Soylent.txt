"Hacking the body is high risk, high reward. I read a textbook on physiological chemistry and took to the internet to see if I could find every known essential nutrient. My kitchen soon looked like a chemistry lab and I had every unknown substance in a glass in front of me. I was a little worried it was going to kill me, but decided it was for science and quickly downed the whole thing. To my surprise, it was quite tasty and I felt very energetic. For 30 days I avoided food entirely and I monitored the contents of my blood and physical performance. Mental performance is harder to quantify, but I feel much sharper."

Curious after reading Monica Heisey's article [*This Man Thinks He Never Has to Eat Again*](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/rob-rhinehart-no-longer-requires-food), from which I took the excerpt above, I headed over to Rob Rhinehart's personal blog [Mostly Harmless](http://robrhinehart.com/) looking for some more information on Soylent. What I found in [*How I Stopped Eating Food*](http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298) and the follow-up article [*What's In Soylent*](http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424), in which Rob chronicled the creation and resulting physical and psychological benefits of Soylent, along with the ingredients and reasons for which he chose to include them, respectively, fascinated me. I look forward to hearing a lot more from Rob in the near future: Soylent is an extremely novel and promising idea, and one that has the potential to not only revolutionize our lives, but the world as well.
