"Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace."

After listening to the fifty-ninth episode of Roderick on the Line, I found the speech written for the president should astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become stranded on the moon. It would be a lonely way to go, sitting on the moon, staring at Earth a few hundred thousand miles away as their oxygen slowly depleted and they suffocated. It would have been a terrible way to go.

Thankfully, this was one speech he never gave.
