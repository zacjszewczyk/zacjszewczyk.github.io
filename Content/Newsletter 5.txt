Did you know that I write a weekly newsletter collecting cool articles and code projects from around the web? Because I do, and I think it's pretty cool; won't you consider signing up? If you need some extra encouragement, how about checking out the past four issues before subscribing? Because you can, just head over to the [campaign archive page](http://bit.ly/1gFx2vZ). The fifth issue just went out a few minutes ago. Hopefully, next Sunday the sixth will go out to you as well.
