No really, that's what it's called: shortly after World War II, Erhard and Sons began manufacturing Albert Friedrich's vehicle for primarily agricultural use in post-war Germany until Mercedes-Benz took over the production process in the early 1950s. Since then, the Unimog has fostered quite the fanatical fan base, not unlike that of its [counterparts](http://silodrome.com/unimog-mercedes-benz/) across the world, the American Jeep, British Land Rover, or Japanese Land Cruiser. And looking at it, and [seeing just what this family can really do](http://youtu.be/INxkz6UcNoE), it's no surprise: this is one remarkably capable vehicle any outdoor enthusiast would be truly fortunate to have in their arsenal.
