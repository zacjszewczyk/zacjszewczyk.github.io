As a rule I avoid publishing links to articles I find on popular tech sites such as Jim Dalrymple's when I do not have anything significant to add to the conversation, but I had to make an exception for this post. When I watched it earlier this morning, I immediately tried to discount it and distance myself from the discomfort it caused me. I have pushed the speed limit on occasion--albeit never so egregiously--and rarely thought about the potential consequences besides a speeding ticket. Everyone who owns a car ought to watch this video, and think long and hard about it next time they feel like punching it.
