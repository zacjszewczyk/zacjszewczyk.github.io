It's taken me way too long, but I finally got some time to read the backlog of email newsletters in my inbox. Alongside [Huckberry's](https://secure.huckberry.com/users/sign_up) and [Benedict Evans' Mobile Newsletter](http://ben-evans.com/newsletter/), today I read my first issue of The Backseat Companion--and let me tell you, I loved it. The Backseat Companion is everything a newsletter should be: interesting, informative, humorous--a joy to read, to be sure. If MailChimp isn't your thing, you can also read [past issues on Medium](https://medium.com/@backseatcomp). Regardless of where you go though, you'll have to head over to [Gianfranco Lanzio and Diego Petrucci's tumblr to subscribe](http://thebackseatcompanion.tumblr.com/). Do yourself a favor and just head over there now though: you'll be there soon enough anyways.
