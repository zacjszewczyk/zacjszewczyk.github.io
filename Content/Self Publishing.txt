An article from Ben Brooks posted in November of last year I had near the middle of my Simplenote list, burried beneath a slew of notes, ideas, and half-baked articles.  

> I'm not interested in writing when it's not about the writing. iBooks Author is neat, but I don't want to learn it - instead I'll just "publish" the book here as a series of posts, where I know what I am doing (somewhat) and where writing is about writing and not layout, marketing, legal issues, notices, copyrights, glossaries, etc.  

I completely agree with his conclusion, as I'm sure many writers do. That's why, in part, I built First Crack: so that once it was working, I didn't need to worry about the logistics and nitpicky details of publication. Instead, I could write in an environment in which "writing is about writing."
