Zac Cichy started a new blog last month titled "[Whole and Part](http://www.wholeandpart.com)". Since then, he has consistently published great articles, particularly with regards to podcasts. From Ben Alexander's article linked at the top of this post, "He's transcribing portions of podcasts as source material for blog posts. His quotes are timestamped and he links directly to the episode in question." Ben goes on to commend Zac further and detail some future plans for his podcast syndicate [Fiat Lux](http://www.fiatlux.fm). If either of these two or their respective sites are unfamiliar to you, I strongly recommend you check out both Zac's site and Ben's podcasts for truly exceptional work.
