I read a few of Marcus's posts, and liked [them](https://utf9k.net/blog/25/) [all](https://utf9k.net/blog/email-lookup/), but it was [his link](https://utf9k.net/blog/publish-old-works/) to [an interview with Ira Glass](https://youtu.be/X2wLP0izeJE) that made me post this. Most have heard this many times before, but it bears repeating: doing good work means first doing a lot of bad work, and having the tenacity to get through those discouraging times. The great creators, to whom far too many aspiring creators prematurely compare themselves, made it through because they pressed on. Success is not a mystery, it's just [hard](Simple Not Easy.txt). Put in the work to get there.
