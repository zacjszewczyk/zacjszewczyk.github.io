When I started this website, I had a number of misgivings. For example, every writer I looked up to had already done this for years or, in some cases, even decades; what could I possibly contribute to such a mature community? I had missed the boat, failed to get in on the ground floor--what hope could I have of rivaling the skill, insight, and popularity of folks like John Siracusa? I struggle similarly with my desire to build an app. But, as John points out in his article [ostensibly](https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422749828448542721) [about](https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422756689449062400) [his](https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422756972136787968) [journey](https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422767118988619776) to U2 [geekdom](https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/422767155697156096), time does not automatically impart upon anyone the necessary traits common to geeks; rather, they are born from a great deal of effort, and anyone that tells you otherwise, that there is some barrier to entry beyond that, is wrong.
