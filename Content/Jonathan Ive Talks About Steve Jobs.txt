Fantastic interview by John Arlidge of Time Magazine with Apple's famed designer Jony Ive. I will do neither the disservice of taking a pull-quote from this piece, for you really should read it in its entirety rather than in pieces, but I will say this: the key takeaway, I felt, is the remarkable humanity of this entire process: from inception to creation to ultimate release, at no point in the life of these devices does anyone measure their viability, utility, or success by something so mundane as technical specifications. Rather, it all comes down to the human element--the experience, to use a rather clich&#233;d turn of phrase, for in the end, when all is said and done, what else is left but the device in your hand?
