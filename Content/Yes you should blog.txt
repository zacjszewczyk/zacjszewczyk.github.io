I have an article in the works on a similar topic, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight this piece by one of my favorite new writers, [Blair Reeves](http://blairreeves.me/), before I reference it there. He makes some great points about the value of blogging, even if you have no intention of ever turning it into a revenue stream.
