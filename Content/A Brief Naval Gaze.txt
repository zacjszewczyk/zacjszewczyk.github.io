Turns out, vanity searches pay off: earlier this evening, my girlfriend pointed an article out to me of particular interest. Writing for Fast Company Labs, Jenna Kagel published [Inside One Blogger's Plan To Make Money Without Hideous Ads](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024517/inside-one-bloggers-plan-to-make-money-without-hideous-ads) on January seventh of this year, where she recounted my plans to take this site from a cost center to a profitable enterprise detailed in [Doing Monetization Well](Doing Monetization Well.txt). To me, to have a site so popular and widely-respected as Fast Company post an article about something *I* wrote and posted to *my* site, that's just awesome; so very cool.
