Almost a year ago today [I linked to](The Battle of Asakai.txt) Penny Arcade's coverage of the famed Battle of Asakai, a war that occurred in the popular game Eve Online and consisted of roughly 3,000 players. As if to commemorate the massive battle's anniversary, several coalitions are currently in the process of finishing the largest fight in the game's history even as I write this. I said it before and I will say it again: "I still can't quite wrap my head around a fight consisting of more than 3,000 individuals. Amazing."
