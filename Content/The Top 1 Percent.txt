I don't agree with the constant vilification of America's top 1%. Some call them "captains of industry", others have much more choice combinations of nouns and verbs to describe the small subset of Americans that earn substantially more than everyone else--the constantly marginalized 99%--as if they somehow did not deserve their hard-won success. This article from The Atlantic does not go as far to dispel that ridiculous notion as its title--doctored above, originally "How You, I, and Everyone Got the Top 1 Percent All Wrong"--might lead everyone to believe, but I guess it's a step in the right direction.
