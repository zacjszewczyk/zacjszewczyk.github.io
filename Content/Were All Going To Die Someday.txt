Great one-two punch from [Sid O'Neill](http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/your-complaint-is-invalid) and [Linus Edwards](http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/3/18/were-all-going-to-die-someday) dealing with significance and its corollary, futility. I often find myself stuck between these two warring factions, fighting with another side of me that questions whether I should spend my time watching TV instead of writing, or writing instead of staying an extra hour in the gym, or working out instead of working more, or working more instead of spending more time with my family and friends, or if I should spend more time with my family than my friends--the list goes on and on, forever, but has to stop somewhere; it's that stopping point that informs our value system, and thus, ultimately, the person we become.
