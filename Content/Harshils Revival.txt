Finally getting around to a few blogs I have wanted to check out for almost a week now, earlier this morning I read Harshil Shah's third blog post since starting his new site. I enjoyed his refreshing honesty, and his new approach seems like a great middle ground between pushing so hard he burns out once again and posting two articles for the entirety of 2013. I look forward to reading more of his excellent writing [very soon](https://twitter.com/harshilshah1910/status/422039100074373120), and you should too.
