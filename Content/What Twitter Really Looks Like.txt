"What's maybe most striking about Tweetping is its presentation of data in pulses and punctuations: boomboomboomboom-PAUSE. That's largely an accident of interface, but it also suggests something profound about Twitter and the social web: This stuff has a beat. It has rhythms and rushes and respites. It's its own kind of organism, with its own kind of pulses -- its own kind of heartbeat."  

At first, the [Tweetping](http://tweetping.net/) world map is nearly empty. A combination of javascript libraries begin parsing a real time stream of data from the Twitter API though, and the map quickly begins to populate. Within a few minutes, the map becomes a somewhat accurate representation of the world's Twitter activity. Although Tweetping has been the recipient of [some criticism](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/02/tweetping/) since coming to widespread attention this past weekend, it is nevertheless one of the best Twitter activity visualizations on the internet. This morning, over breakfast, I used it to watch the West Coast wake up.
