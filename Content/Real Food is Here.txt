Hat-tip to another article from Huckberry, [Modern Pioneering](http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/modern-pioneering), that [I just linked to](Modern Pioneering.txt) for bringing this one from 2013 to my attention. In the past, I have written extensively about Rohan Anderson's own work, as well as his escapades: when he felled trees and [built an awesome smokehouse](http://cabinporn.com/post/31346968688/hunter-grower-gather-blogger-rohan-anderson-built) by hand, that fantastic video led to a string of four posts--[Something to it](Something to it.txt), [walk it off brother](walk it off brother.txt), [hard at work, living simple](hard at work.txt), and [so simple](so simple.txt)--that effectively chronicled my amazement with and admiration for his chosen lifestyle. And then I stumbled across this piece, and all of those feelings rushed back even stronger than before.
