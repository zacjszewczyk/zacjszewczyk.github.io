I found this article after [*Making the obvious code fast*](https://jackmott.github.io/programming/2016/07/22/making-obvious-fast.html), where Jack Mott explained the impact of ignoring basic optimization. In his 2016 piece [*Marginal Gains*](https://jackmott.github.io/programming/tools/editor/ide/visual/studio/2016/07/01/marginal-gains.html), he went over some small tips to make developers' lives easier. He had some good suggestions, and I want to take a minute to emphasize one of his points.

**Use the command line as much as possible, so that you can automate as much of your work as possible.** Most programs wrap one or more command line tools. This helps non-technical people. Take out the middleman, though, learn to use the underlying tool, and then write a script to work for you. Automate the boring tasks, so that you can focus on the exciting ones, take on new roles, further your own education, or even start a side hustle.

If you spend a lot of time optimizing images for the web, for example, [let the command line handle that](https://imageoptim.com/command-line.html). Do you work with videos? [It can handle that, too](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.2.0/cli/command-line-reference.html). If you spend hours scrolling through thousands of lines of log files, [why not save some time by taking out all traffic to the server from your developers' machines?](http://droptips.com/using-grep-to-exclude-lines-containing-certain-characterstext) You cannot do everything with the command line, but you can free yourself from the boring in favor of more challenging and interesting work.
