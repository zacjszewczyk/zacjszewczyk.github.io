Earlier this morning Dan Ryan posted [*The Problem with Kickstarter*](http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2013/01/17/the-problem-with-kickstarter/) over on Xconomy. Joshua Beckman of SthgNw commented on the piece, saying, "The problem really is that people sell ideas and are expected to deliver hard products." I would take Josh's opinion one step further: the problem is that people sell *hard* ideas and are expected to deliver hard products.
