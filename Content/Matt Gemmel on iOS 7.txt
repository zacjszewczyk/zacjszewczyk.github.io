Wonderfully worded and impressively well thought-out, Matt Gemmel's article *iOS 7* is easily the best piece on the topic I have read since the WWDC keynote address. In explaining the motivation behind Apple's complete UI overhaul in iOS7, he began his one-two punch with this paragraph:

> "The thing is, we've grown up. We don't require hand-holding to tell us what to click or tap. Interactivity is a matter of invitation, and physical cues are only one specific type. iOS 7 is an iOS for a more mature consumer, who understands that digital surfaces are interactive, and who doesn't want anything getting in the way of their content."

Then, following up, he said something [curiously familiar](Anti-iOS 7 Anger.txt) before moving on with the article:

> "The basic functionality hasn't changed. You still use iOS in the same way, and almost everything is where you expect it to be. The same gestures work. There are a few differences here and there - it's a major new version of the OS, after all - but the changes are mostly aesthetic. You won't be confused by iOS 7 if you're accustomed to a previous version."
