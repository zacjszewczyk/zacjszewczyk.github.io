Linked to [by Shawn Blanc](https://twitter.com/shawnblanc/status/410457204450263040), this is absolutely hilarious. Coincidentally Marco just posted an article titled [*Siri Accuracy Continues to Improve*](http://www.marco.org/2013/12/10/siri-accuracy-improving), where he complained about Siri's frequent inability to process his requests. Since I finally upgraded to a 4S last month I have been using Siri daily, and with the exception of a few incorrect words it has worked both flawlessly and exceptionally quickly regardless of my cellular connection strength. I have yet to see see the, "Sorry, I can't take requests right now" error message.
