It's no secret that I harbor a strong dislike of The Verge: perpetually vying with public radio for the title of my most hated news institution, I make no bones about [sharing](https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/492809842709782528) this [disgust](https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/491710620749012992) with others. And so, because of that, when the news first broke that Josh Topolsky--a writer I have [no great love for](Bullies.txt)--was leaving Vox for Bloomberg, I barely took notice; however, a lot of other people have, and this has since become quite the news story for many. To each their own, I suppose.

Until this morning, I had not planned to write anything about this event: I just *don't care*. But then Daniel Ignacio [sent me a link](https://twitter.com/dotdapple/status/493281692048576512) to a conversation between him and Mathew Conto, and I just couldn't resist [sharing the link here](http://imgur.com/a/Iq9HJ/): this is everything you need to know about The Verge and Josh Topolsky's move both. Welcome to The Precipice.
