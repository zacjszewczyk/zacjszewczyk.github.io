I really, really like this. To put it in the context of writing, how about taking your best day--whether you measure that by number of articles posted or page views gained--and make that your goal *every single day?* It would be hard, and many would say impractical, but maintaining the same waistline for fifteen years is hard too. In both cases, though, they are worthwhile pursuits.
