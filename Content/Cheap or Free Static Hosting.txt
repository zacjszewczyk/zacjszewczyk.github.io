I found Scott Murray's post [after I started looking for something to replace Amazon S3](Dont Use Amazon Web Services.txt). He lists a bunch of places for cheap or free static hosting, most of which I had never heard of. If [Google Firebase](How to Own Your Platform.txt) will not work for you, check this post out for some other ideas.
