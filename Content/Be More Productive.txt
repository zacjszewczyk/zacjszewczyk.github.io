Aaron Swartz made a number of interesting observations and suggestions throughout this piece. Of those, this is my favorite, found near the end of the article:  

    "I first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college. Writing essays isn't a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned. Who would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations of two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little jokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little style, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the added benefit of padding things out.) Another way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem. Instead of building a web application, try building a web application framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful."
