Awesome video showing how, when heated to certain temperatures, water can actually flow uphill. It seems impossible, but--as the folks over at Science Friday demonstrate--some neat factors come into play after the boiling point to make it possible. Very cool, via [The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/03/17/how-to-make-water-flow-uphill/).
