A more apropos title, I feel, might read something along the lines of "Entitlement in the Age of Abundance". Between that, and Ben's actual title, I'm sure you can get a fair idea as to the subject matter of his article. And his closing point: the cliched "you never know what you've got 'till it's gone". I find it remarkable how many love to hate companies like Google, yet have no problem crawling back to them when they finally realize how instrumental the "evil overlord" was to their daily operations. Whether an individual whining about the company's privacy practices or, as is the case here, a publisher acting on a misplaced sense of entitlement, the outcome is the same.

Stick to your high-brow morals if you must, but if you must, actually stick to them.
