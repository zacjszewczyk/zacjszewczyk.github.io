It's old, but--[as the saying goes](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/760585088035803136?lang=en), every day someone is born who has never seen the Flintstones. I wanted to take a second to drop a link to Mozilla's new project, [Firefox Send](http://send.firefox.com). This service promises free, private, end-to-end encrypted, and temporary file transfers from a respected company with a stated desire to preserve its users privacy. Check out the release notes [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/03/12/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private/). Also of interest, [pCloud Transfer](https://transfer.pcloud.com/) allows anonymous users to send encrypted, password-protected files, too; pCould Transfer doubles the max file size of Firefox Send, though, but that comes at the price of some neat features that keep Mozilla's new project in the running for me.
