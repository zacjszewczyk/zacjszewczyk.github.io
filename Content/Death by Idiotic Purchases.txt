I happened across [Expedition Portal](http://expeditionportal.com/) the other day after the same tangent led me to [Triple Aught Design](https://tripleaughtdesign.com). Already more than an hour down this rabbit hole of outdoor expeditions and the gear enthusiasts use on such trips, I started clicking--and clicking, and then I clicked some more until I had filled my entire Safari tab bar. And then, I began reading this humorous article by Mathew Scott from March of last year: [Death by Idiotic Purchases](http://expeditionportal.com/death-by-idiotic-purchases-why-you-should-never-buy-a-fixie/). If the only thing you, like me, love more than actually spending time outdoors is buying the gear to make that experience more enjoyable, and you're looking for a laugh, this is a great place to start.
