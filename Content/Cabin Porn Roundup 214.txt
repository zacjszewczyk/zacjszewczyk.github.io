I have a very light issue for you this month, unfortunately: precious little caught my eye over the past few weeks. In fact, just two articles did, and only one came from Cabin Porn: a [third-generation hand-made cabin from Michigan](http://cabinporn.com/post/77427808607/3rd-generation-hand-made-family-cabin-on-the-upper). This structure, to me, defines the genre: built of wood and stone and out in the middle of the woods, not some modern architecture retrofitted into a rustic getaway a few hundred feet from the nearest road, this cabin has *character*. And I love that about it.  

The second and final link comes from Vimeo, by way of Twitter: [Zen and the Art of Powder Boarding](http://vimeo.com/87155994). Although I'm not convinced the video's creators did not just prepend the title with "zen" in an attempt at making it somehow more attractive to potential viewers, I did find myself enjoying this short view into the world of powder boarding. I'm no snowboarder--barely a skier--but even if just to visit all the neat places filmed here, I would love to become one.
