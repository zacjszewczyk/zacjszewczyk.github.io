Via [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/not-soon-enough/), Chrys Bader takes a very interesting look at where Facebook came from, its current state, and the platform's bleak future. With the exception of Twitter I have all but abandoned social networks, including the venerable elder statesman Facebook, so I rarely take any interest in articles examining them. I followed Ben's link on a whim though, and I'm very glad I did.

Especially damning, I thought, was his comparison of Facebook to LinkedIn: "Teens likely see Facebook the same way the Facebook generation sees LinkedIn--like a utilitarian place to manage connections." Facebook has crossed the Rubicon, so to speak; from here no amount of money will ever bring it back.
