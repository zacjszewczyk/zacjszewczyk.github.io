Up until now, I have, with but [one exception](Smart & Funny.txt), abstained from writing a single article containing anything but simple text. That exception, a video from Merlin Mann, Scott Simpson, and Adam Lisagor titled [Smart and Funny](http://vimeo.com/1212142), was just too good to resist: I couldn't bear the thought of not posting it, of not sharing this hilarious video with everyone that happened to visit my site.

As I said, that video is the only exception, an exception I made because it was *great*. Today, a new Tumblr popped up called Unsplash. Every ten days, the curator of Unsplash posts ten new hi-resolution photos, free for anyone to use in all their glory. The first ten are nothing short of amazing--not great, even better: amazing. I can't wait to see the next batch.
