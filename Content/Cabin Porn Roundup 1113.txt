Starting with November month, I have decided to take a different approach to posting links to cabins I find inspiring, attractive, or otherwise worthy of note: rather than make an individual post each time I come upon such a structure, from here on out I will hold them for the end of the month when I can collect my favorite posts and pictures. This will not only reduce the volume of "Wow." and "Beautiful." one-word link posts I have made a habit of publishing since discovering the Cabin Porn Tumblr last year, but will also allow me to centralize these relevant thoughts into a single monthly post.

On November third, Cory Weidenbach posted a picture of a "[massive treefort in the Catskills of New York](http://cabinporn.com/post/65890726507/massive-treefort-in-the-catskills-of-new-york)." Growing up I would have *loved* a house like this. Honestly though, who am I kidding--I would still love to have a house like this.

On the topic of tree houses, I also really liked this one in [Swanzey, New Hampshire](http://cabinporn.com/post/66276868941/treehouse-in-swanzey-new-hampshire-contributed). Much higher off the ground and slightly more modestly built, this would be more my style. Not that I would complain either way though, mind you.

[Since I discovered](Cabin Porn.txt) almost a year ago now it has shown me some amazing videos, like [*This Must Be The Place*](http://cabinporn.com/post/13641808772/this-must-be-the-place-by-lost-found-films-50) and [*The Smokehouse*](http://vimeo.com/48864768). On November twentieth the site's editors once again found another great video, this time about a [professional fort builder](http://cabinporn.com/post/67562876517/meet-jay-nelson-professional-fort-builder-on-the). I love these videos.

And finally, towards the end of November an [ice house near Lake Placid, NY](http://cabinporn.com/post/68058008660/ice-house-near-lake-placid-ny-contributed-by) popped up, and despite not technically a cabin I couldn't help but include it here. I have always wanted to visit upstate New York to see this sort of beautiful natural scenery in a place only known for its bustling cities. Perhaps someday on my way to Maine.

Although I failed to post this on December 1st as I had originally planned, I see it as a way to leave room for improvement next month.
