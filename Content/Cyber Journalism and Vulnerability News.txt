Robert Graham just reminded me why [I started reading Errata Security](My Morning Reads.txt). I hadn't yet gotten around to the recent New York Times article on the Baltimore hack, but [his response](https://blog.erratasec.com/2019/05/a-lesson-in-journalism-vs-cybersecurity.html) makes it clear that the op-ed is not worth my time. I can only hope Rob's post gets as much attention as the piece that prompted it. I also found [his dive into the BlueKeep vulnerability](https://blog.erratasec.com/2019/05/almost-one-million-vulnerable-to.html) interesting; [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com), another site I check every morning, [has already picked it up](https://thehackernews.com/2019/05/bluekeep-rdp-vulnerability.html?m=1). This is the type of quality content I expect from [the small-time sites I read](My Morning Reads.txt), and once again, Rob delivered.
