[Speaking of the Mercedes-Benz Unimog](Mercedes Benz Unimog.txt), a modified version of the versatile chassis has been [making](http://uncrate.com/stuff/kiravan/) [the](http://www.blessthisstuff.com/stuff/vehicles/misc/kiravan-expedition-vehicle/) [rounds](http://gearjunkie.com/kiravan-expedition-vehicle-rv) lately in the form of a vehicle its creator, Bran Ferren, dubbed the "[KiraVan](http://kiravan.net)" after his four-year-old daughter, Kira. For those of you more inclined towards this vehicular monster's technical specifications, Gear Junkie has [a nice rundown](http://gearjunkie.com/kiravan-expedition-vehicle-rv); for everyone else--for everyone, actually, because it explains the projects origins and the reasons behind Bran's unwavering dedication to this costly endeavor, Wired has a fantastic article aptly titled "[The Most Insane Truck Ever Built and the 4-Year-Old Who Commands It](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/worlds-biggest-rv/)" that I recommend everyone read. This is an incredible story, and a very admirable one as well.
