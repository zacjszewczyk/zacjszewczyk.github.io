An interesting story made all the more absorbing by the model Amanda employed in stark contrast to the one nearly all writers in the circles I frequent employ. Whereas we hold the individual's reputation on high--[I read people, not websites](A Year of Firsts.txt)--she takes the opposite approach in impersonally finding, occupying, and ultimately cashing out on an existing niche rather than create her own as I and many others are want to do. A thought-provoking approach, to say the least, and inarguably effective: I can't argue with her results.
