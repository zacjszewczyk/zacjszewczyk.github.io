I took over a team in June, and like Dwight, I have more than one priority. We have our mission and all the tasks it entails, but on my own time, I decided to also encourage my Solders to take an active role in their personal development. This involved a long write-up, a detailed plan, and a list of many books, articles, and projects to guide their study. Those will make their way here in time, but for now, I want to highlight some of the gems I re-discovered as part of this process--starting with [*Writing vs writing*](https://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/), by Shawn Blanc.  

I used to read everything [Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/) wrote, and this piece from 2011 reminded me why. Writing is hard, and the people who don't think so either haven't written enough, or haven't written well enough, to understand this.
