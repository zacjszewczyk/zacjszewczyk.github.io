After Marco Arment posted his great article on [fancy headphones and fussy coffee](http://www.marco.org/2014/02/03/headphones-and-coffee) back in February, I strongly considered dropping $180 that I--to be brutally honest--didn't have on a pair of [Beyerdynamic DT-770-PRO 32ohm closed dynamic headphones](http://amzn.com/B008POFOHM). Whether fortunately or unfortunately, I still cannot say, sanity won out though, and I abstained from blowing a week's salary on what I have no doubt would have been a fantastic listening experience. As both Linus and Marco explained though, you don't have to spend a ton of money on great headphones just to have a good time listening to your music: take the advice of a few trustworthy people, spend within your means, sit back, and enjoy.
