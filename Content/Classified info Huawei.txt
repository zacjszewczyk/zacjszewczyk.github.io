I have talked about arguments [for and against Huawei](Proxy Innovation.txt) before, as well as [the challenge of judging risk](Huawei and Managing 5G Risk.txt) in this space. Many of those in favor of Huawei cite a lack of concrete evidence against the company, but as James Vincent reports at *The Verge*, [it appears US intelligence agencies have begun providing that evidence](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-china). The new law requiring them to cut ties with Huawei of course explains why US tech companies [have done so](https://thehackernews.com/2019/05/google-intel-huawei.html), but perhaps the fact that they did so without protest means the info [James references](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-china) is compelling after all.
