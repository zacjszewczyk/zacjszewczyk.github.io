When I wrote my first article about Reeder, [*Changing my Workflow with Drafts and Reeder*](Drafts and Reeder.txt), I highlighted its lack of reliance on Google Reader as one of the main reasons I chose to go with the RSS app. That was a factually incorrect statement; however, with [this announcement](https://twitter.com/reederapp/status/317001614873489408), Reeder's creator Silvio Rizzi announced that the popular iOS RSS reader would add Feedbin support in the very near future, thus ending its reliance on Google Reader. I realize Reeder supports Fever and Readability as well, but this is nevertheless great news.
