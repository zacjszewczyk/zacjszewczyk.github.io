This is how one should leave a podcast, respectful of both his listeners and co-hosts alike. [Not that I'm pointing any fingers](Regarding The Talk Show.txt).

> "This isn't the end of the road for me on the podcasting front; I'll still appear as a guest on various shows, and have ideas on what might make sense for stratechery in both the near and short term. In the meantime, though, I'll simply be a listener and a learner of Cubed, not a host.

> "My thanks to both Ben Bajarin and Benedict Evans for the opportunity."
