I don't have an infant son to take care of, so I cannot speak to that adventure, but I can speak to its effects: every so often I undergo bouts of insomnia-like symptoms where no matter how much I may want to sleep, regardless of how significantly tomorrow's test will effect my grade, it's all I can do to hold myself still while my mind races. *What am I doing tomorrow? Did I finish all my homework? Will I have time to listen to that latest podcast episode? How about write? It's been far too long since I've written anything but a link post. But I have so many articles in Instapaper...will I have time to finish them tomorrow?* They say those who sleep well at night will never possess the perspective to truly appreciate the inability to sleep, and I completely agree with that: shortly after these experiences end, as I forget how truly terrible the last few nights were, even I begin to lose perspective; it really wasn't *that* bad, after all. But losing sleep is: I never feel motivated to do anything, nothing interests me, I have a short temper and an even shorter tolerance for others, everything loses its luster, and the list goes on and on. Least of all, I feel the urge to create: that's the last thing I want to do after managing to fall asleep only to wake up a few hours later. I can only imagine how rough Sid has it right now.
