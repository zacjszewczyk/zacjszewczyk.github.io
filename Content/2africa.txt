Every time I see an article like this one, I think back to something Horace Dediu said in [*Making rain*](http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/10/making-rain/):

> “I propose a way to think about [the Facebook Home and the Google Fiber issue] as: Google tries to make a business succeed through having a huge amount of *flow* in terms of data, traffic, queries and information that is indexed. So think about this idea of them tapping into a vast stream. The more volume that is flowing through the system the more revenue they generate.”

Not quite so altruistic after all.
