Although I'm still coming to terms with her use of "#ModernPioneering" when [promoting this](https://twitter.com/GPellegrini/status/456464147094708224), Huckberry's recent article on Georgia Pellegrini is great even if it does seem--to me, at least--almost absurd to see the two disparate worlds of pioneering and hashtags collide so inelegantly. Someday, I would love to live the lifestyle she leads: it sounds incredible.
