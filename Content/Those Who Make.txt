I have a particular fondness for hand-crafted things, and a special spot in my heart for crafting those things myself. [Those Who Make](http://vimeo.com/channels/thosewhomake/) features masters of their respective crafts doing what they do best: making things. Since coming across the Vimeo channel in [an article over on Shawn Blanc's blog](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/01/those-who-make/) last night, I only just managed to pull myself away for long enough to write this short post. As Shawn Blanc said, "Click through with caution -- you may never come back."
