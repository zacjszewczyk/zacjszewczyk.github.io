Another blogger writing a response to Rohan Anderson's post [*Hard at Work, Living Simple*](http://wholelarderlove.com/hard-at-work-living-simple/), putting in to words the feeling I spent so long attempting to quantify and capture but, ultimately, proved too elusive to voice in [my commentary](hard at work.txt):

> "There is no manual, no one set way to downsize, seize life, focus on what's important.  But geez, when I read Rohan's Whole Larder Love blog entry today, I was ready to make him my guru, his website my guide to 'simple living'.  Read it for yourself.  Just this one post struck me deeply and I cannot explain why.  But I sat at my desk looking out my 6th floor office window reading it on my iPhone at lunch time with tears thickening my eyes."
