Leading up to [Linus Edwards's](https://twitter.com/linusedwards) [promise](http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/1/8/the-hard-way) of an article after he, I, and a number of others had an incredibly long conversation about growing one's readership and attracting attention on Twitter yesterday, I had been toying with the idea of writing one myself. However, when he decided to put his own post together, I chose to forgo mine until he published his. As it turns out, I did the right thing: reading *The Hard Way* earlier this afternoon, it was as if I had written it myself. Linus covered all the points I would have and even told a story that could have just as easily fit my experience working to drive traffic towards my work. All in all, an excellent retrospective and a great starting point for anyone thinking of launching their own website.
