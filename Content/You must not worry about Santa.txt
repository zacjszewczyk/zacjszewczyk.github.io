Every once in a while, Letters of Note posts something great, a letter I just have to share. This is one such letter. [For me](In Event of Moon Disaster.txt), the last one was [a speech William Safire wrote for President Nixon](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/11/in-event-of-moon-disaster.html?m=1) in preparation for a disaster during the moon landing; perhaps the best speech I have ever read.
