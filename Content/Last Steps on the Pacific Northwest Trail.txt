Jeff Kish, contributing editor at the excellent site GearJunkie, spent the summer hiking 1,200 miles on the Pacific Northwest Trail. I followed his journey from that first report in July all the way up to this the conclusion of his trek, and I have to say: I'm both jealous and impressed. If you had the misfortune of missing this great series, head over and check it out: it's well-worth your time. [Follow Thru-Hike Of "Pacific Northwest Trail" All Summer](http://gearjunkie.com/pnt).
