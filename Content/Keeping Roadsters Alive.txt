I like seeing passionate people talk about their craft, and Carl Medlock has a passion for Tesla Roadsters. This story reminded me of [Rich Benoit rebuilding his own Tesla](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvm3z5/rich-rebuilds-tesla-repair-and-salvage). When I want to get away from my screen I stick with woodworking for the most part, but I would love to get into this sort of work. I can [build out my car](/projects.html#sleepingPlatform), but I would love to do more.
