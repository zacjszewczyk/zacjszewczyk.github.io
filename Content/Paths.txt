I think The Typist put it best when he posted [a tweet linking to this piece](https://twitter.com/typistX/status/452184590028128256) by Matt Gemmell, where he said, "I am wary of superlatives but @mattgemmell's latest is the best piece of text I've read in the last 5 years; at least". This truly is a phenomenal work of prose, simultaneously remarkably sad, hopeful, and intensely inspirational; better words of advice than those at the end of Matt's article have never been said.
