Hat-tip to Shawn Blanc for [the original link](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/for-the-love-of-money/), former hedge-fund manager Sam Polk talks about his amazing journey from addict college dropout to making nearly four million dollars in a single bonus, to say nothing of his base salary and any other dividends accrued throughout the year. If you, like me and so many others, have ever thought, "If I could just win the lottery, think of all the great things I could do; all the problems that money would solve", you ought to read this; even if you have never thought that, you should still read this. It's an incredible and harrow story of wealth, greed, and, ultimately, redemption.
