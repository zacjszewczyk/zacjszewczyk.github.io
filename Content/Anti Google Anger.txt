Marco Arment in [*Your favorite Thursday sandwich*](http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich), where he argued against Om Malik's [decision not to use Google Keep](http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/):  

    "In this business, you can't count on anything having longevity. To avoid new services that are likely to get shut down within a few years, you'd have to avoid every new tech product. Products and services lasting more than a few years are the exception, not the rule."  

And while I feel he does make a valid point, Marco overlooked a key difference between Google and every new tech product: Google has done this in the past and will do it again: this is not the first time they have closed the doors on a product we love, nor will it be the last. That's the difference here. That's the problem. Unfortunately though, Marco is right: everyone will continue to use Google's products despite this uncertainty. Sure, a few may take a principled stand like Om Malik did, but at the end of the day, it won't matter.
