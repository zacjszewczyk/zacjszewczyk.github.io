Hat-tip to Hayes Brown for [tweeting](https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/481643519161823232) this link, apparently Amazon does, indeed, sell everything--including, it seems, radioactive uranium ore. This surprisingly unsurprising development is not the best part though, but rather the "Customer Questions and Answers" section as well as the top reviews; in a word, hilarious.
