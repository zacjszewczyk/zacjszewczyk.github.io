I have used GitHub [for a while now](My Setup 2019.txt), but even more over the last few weeks. Gists have proven especially useful, as a quick and easy way to take notes at work. I had a hunch these might [work like a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists), and Giovanni Cappellotto confirmed my suspicion. Hat-tip to him for his nice walkthrough of a simple collaboration workflow.
