I listened to every episode of [The B&B Podcast](http://5by5.tv/bb) back when Shawn Blanc and Ben Brooks recorded it once a week up until just shy of a year ago. It came as a great disappointment, then, when it ended rather abruptly. Thankfully, I did not have to go without for long: today, Shawn announced a new weekly show to be released alongside his members-only Shawn Today podcast. I already subscribed, and I recommend you do as well: if The Weekly Brief is anything like its predecessor or reflects even a portion of its creator's great work, it will be well worth the time.

While on the topic, I would just like to say that it's encouraging to see my idea of a members-only show with [a public counterpart](http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/Doing-Monetization-Well.htm#3000VisitorsaMonth) validated by a writer I respect as much as I do Shawn Blanc. If nothing else, it shows that I'm on the right track.
