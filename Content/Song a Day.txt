Since January first, 2009, Jonathan Mann has written a song every day. Every single day, for four years, four months, and four weeks exactly, Jonathan Mann, without fail, wrote and produced a song. That's 1609 days, and 1609 songs. Those who have a hard time writing every day, feel free to take notes.  

His song for Hypercritical, [#1450](http://youtu.be/pOyDW_Y2Emo), and what became the Accidental Tech Podcast's ending theme, [#1546](http://youtu.be/iCXItGrjqrw), are my two favorites. If you're looking for some background, check out [the bio video he posted last year](http://youtu.be/MpFhNJQoGho); otherwise, go check out some of his songs.
