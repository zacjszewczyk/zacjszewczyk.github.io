I liked this article for its breakdown of East versus West Coast off-road routes, and even more so because Mercedes Lilienthal also gives her eastern seaboard readers some actual destinations to check out. I can tackle [the Georgia Traverse](https://www.georgiaoverland.com/map.html) in a weekend, and a few of the other trails she mentioned over a long weekend. I look forward to heading out there soon.
