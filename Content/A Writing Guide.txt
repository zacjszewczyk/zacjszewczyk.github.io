Shawn Blanc and Patrick Rhone are two of my favorite writers. For this week's installment of The Weekly Briefly, they teamed up and recorded *A Writing Guide* where they shared their thoughts on writing, motivation, building an audience, and putting yourself out there. Regardless of how good a writer you consider yourself, whether you follow these two or not, and even if you never intend to take writing beyond a nights-and-weekends hobby, I cannot recommend this episode enough: out of the hundreds of hours I have spent listening to podcasts over the last five years, this is by far and away one of the best--if not *the* best--episodes on writing I have ever listened to.
