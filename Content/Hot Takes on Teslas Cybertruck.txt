I spent the morning reading hot takes on Tesla's new Cybertruck. I have some more thinking to do, but [Jason Torchinsky](https://jalopnik.com/a-deep-look-at-the-design-of-tesla-s-cybertruck-1839993654) wrote a great post on the truck's design, and [Kim Reynolds](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing) did a nice job approaching the topic from a manufacturing standpoint. [Andrew Collins](https://jalopnik.com/how-the-tesla-cybertruck-hypothetically-measures-up-to-1839993925) also has a nice comparison of the Cybertruck versus some of its competitors, which is beats on all fronts.
