"A typeface's readability is about far more than just one cosmetic attribute."

Something to keep in mind next time you design a website with Arial or Helvetica. You don't even have to buy a font from TypeKit: go to Google Web Fonts and pick something suitable from there--anything to make your site more readable and set yourself apart from everyone else is an excellent choice. Remember, though, that the first job a font should be employed to do is make readable content; it should not be employed to take over the job of your design, but rather serve as a complement to a superb design.
