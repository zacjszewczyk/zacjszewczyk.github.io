Nice to finally have some closure on this subject. I never got into Flappy Bird--I never even downloaded the game--but I couldn't help but get sucked into the "discussion"--and I use that term loosely here--around the game, especially after its creator took Flappy Bird down at the peak of its popularity. I wish him good luck in the future; he has been remarkably blessed, and I have no doubt he will make good use of that good fortune.
