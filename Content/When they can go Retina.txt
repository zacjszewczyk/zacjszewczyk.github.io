Like Casey Liss I did not particularly care for John Siracusa and Marco Arment's incessant Mac Pro banter, but kept listening because I enjoy their thoughts and opinions so much. I found Marco's latest post, however, where he explained why he believes we will not see a true Retina iMac-caliber display for quite some time, very interesting.  

> "To bring Retina to the 27&rdquo; iMac and 27&rdquo; Thunderbolt Display, Apple doesn't need to wait until 5120x2880 panels are available. They can launch them at the next-lowest common resolution and use software scaling to let people simulate it if they want, or display things slightly larger at perfect native resolution. ... That next resolution down, of course, is 4K."
