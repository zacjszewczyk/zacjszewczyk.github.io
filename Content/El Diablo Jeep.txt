Late last year [I linked to](Filson 4x4.txt) another, similar post from Huckberry on the [Filson 4X4](http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/filson-4x4). Like Filson's modified Jeep, Starwood Motors made significant modifications to this once-run-of-the-mill vehicle, transforming it into something remarkably cool--perhaps even cooler than its impressive cousin, also linked in Huckberry's post, the [Starwood Full Metal Jacket Jeep](http://uncrate.com/stuff/starwood-full-metal-jacket-jeep/). Although at $72,888 and $107,000, respectively, both will remain far outside of my price range for the foreseeable future, I can always look, and look I definitely will.
