Ben Brooks in [*How Mailbox Can Make Me a User*](http://brooksreview.net/2013/03/mailbox-and-dropbox/) on [the recent announcement](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/15/4108640/dropbox-acquires-email-app-mailbox) that Dropbox had [acquired Mailbox](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/15/4110532/dropbox-reportedly-paid-around-100-million-for-mailbox):

> "And I would be comfortable, knowing that Dropbox--a company I pay money to host, sync, and back up my files and emails--would not want to fuck up and lose me as a customer."

This seems to be the prevailing sentiment on the internet at the moment, and I lean more towards agreeing with it than raising any objections. I do wonder, though, how we would all react if it had been Google that purchased Mailbox instead of Dropbox, and if it was Google rather than our beloved Dropbox planning to implement some of the features these writers--Ben Brooks included--so hope for.
