Yesterday afternoon Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa recorded the final episode of their casual car podcast, Neutral. Episode twelve, [*Vomit Ruins Everything*](http://neutral.fm/episodes/12-vomit-ruins-everything), runs for just under two hours and chronicles Marco and Tiff's joint vacation with Casey and his wife Erin to pick up Marco's brand new BMW M5 in Germany. I lamented the end of Hypercritical and Build & Analyze, and felt equally as sad--if not even more so--to hear the car door shut for the last time after a run of just twelve episodes.
