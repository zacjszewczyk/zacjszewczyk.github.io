"Members contribute nearly half of this site's income. Which means there is no way I could be writing here as my full-time gig without the generous support of the members."

With a month left in Shawn Blanc's membership drive he announced an additional incentive to the existing membership perks: prizes. Worth an aggregate of more than $3,000, these prizes are a great way to encourage readers on the fence about whether to become a member or not and an interesting take on the increasingly popular practice of individual bloggers cultivating a strong readership through member programs. Here's to hoping Shawn not only reaches his goal, but exceeds it as well.
