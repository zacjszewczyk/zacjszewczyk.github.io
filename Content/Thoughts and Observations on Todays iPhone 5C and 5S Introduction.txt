I'm a little late to the party, I admit, but John Gruber's thoughts and observations concerning the iPhone event last week are just as interesting now as they would have been Tuesday afternoon.  

The interesting trend, I think, as I work through my Instapaper queue from last week reading various writers' opinions, is everyone recognizing Apple's strategy with the 5C as exactly what it is: a marketing gimmick designed to give them cause to market both this year's top model and last year's hardware.
