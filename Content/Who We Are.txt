An incredible video from a group of hunters who make no excuses for their chosen profession, but who also approach it with the extreme respect that nature deserves. I personally have never had a particularly strong desire to take up hunting, but hearing Donnie Vincent talk about nature with such reverence showed me a side of this lifestyle--for to call it a "sport" would be to do the lifestyle Donnie and his companions devoted themselves a great disservice--that I had previously never seen. There is now little doubt in my mind that there exists a more noble passion than this.
