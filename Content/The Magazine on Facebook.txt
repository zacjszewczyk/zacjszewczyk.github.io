"We now have a Facebook page where we will post photos, video, and teasers of upcoming articles."  

I have to keep reminding myself that I like The Magazine and Glenn Fleishman, that Facebook is not the epitome of evil, and that just because The Magazine now has a Facebook page doesn't necessarily signal the beginning of the end.  

I'm curious to see what Ben Brooks thinks about this announcement.
