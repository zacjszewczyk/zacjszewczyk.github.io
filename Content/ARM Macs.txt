Jean-Louis Gassee, in [yesterday's Monday Note](https://mondaynote.com/arm-ed-mac-we-have-an-answer-545a20419a46):

> "An answer to the now age-old ARM-ed Mac question now emerges: With the emphasis on the iPad Pro as a real computer, there's no reason for Apple to move the Mac off of trusty if perhaps less glamorous Intel processors."

If I may finish his sentence, "... there's no reason for Apple to move the Mac off of trusty if perhaps less glamorous Intel processors, *because the iPad will soon replace the Mac*." As for when this will happen, I don't know--and if Jean-Louis does, he's not saying. With each passing year it becomes more feasible from a technical standpoint, but it will take a sea change in Apple's strategic thinking for this to actually happen.

This reminds me of the electric car situation: they have gotten pretty good, but [at least for my use case](Expediton Vehicles.txt), [they aren't quite good enough](My Electric Vehicle Wish List.txt). I can see that this will change soon, but--again--it will take a sea change in strategic thinking to make this happen. In this case, that means automakers stop trying to turn a truck into an electric truck, and start designing vehicles to take full advantage of all this new technology enables.

As I start shopping around to replace my trusty 2013 MacBook Pro, I hope Apple will make its decision soon.
