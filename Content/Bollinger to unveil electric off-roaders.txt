I first heard about Bollinger's B1 and B2 electric off-road vehicles [back](https://gearpatrol.com/2017/07/28/electric-suv-bollinger-b1-sut-photos-live-reveal-bronco-jeep-competitor/) in [July](http://www.valetmag.com/living/gear/2017/bollinger-all-electric-suv-073117.php). Their simple construction and classic, Land Rover-esq aesthetic sucked me right in. According to electrek, the company plans to unveil prototypes and pricing [this month](https://electrek.co/2019/08/26/bollinger-electric-pickup-truck-b1-utility-truck-b2-price-prototypes/amp/). The Rivian R1T [stole the show at Overland Expo earlier this year](https://www.motor1.com/news/350210/rivian-r1t-electric-camper-overland-expo/), but as far as electric overland vehicles go, I am much more excited to see what Bollinger can bring to market. Their platforms will give builders much more freedom to craft [the perfect adventure rig](Expedition Rigs.txt) than any vehicle we have seen thus far, and [no matter what we buy](How to Buy and Import a Rig.txt), that's what we're all after here.
