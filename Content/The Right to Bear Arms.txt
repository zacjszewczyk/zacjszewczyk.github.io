A particularly astute observation from my favorite blog, Blogarach.  

    "America is a nation of tantrum-throwing moral infants that's been dragged bawling out of the crib of its own moral and ethical object impermanence, and even now it's kicking and screaming on the floor of the department store, yelling that some black guy got into a California law school ahead of a deserving white."
