I have a lot of thoughts about choosing an expedition rig. [I went over them before](Expedition Rigs.txt), so I won't repeat myself here. On the topic of a van for between $100,000 and $200,000, though, I will say this: as prices for these vehicles climb, do not forget to consider the other rigs ever-higher price points make viable. If you plan to spend $60,000 on a cool van but come to terms with shelling out $200,000 for Sportsmobile's beast, take stock of what else that $200,000 might get you before you pull the trigger. At this point you have gotten into [EarthCruiser](https://earthcruiser.com/) territory, and as cool as the Sportsmobile Classic may be, I would rather the former.
