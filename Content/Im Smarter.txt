Many developers have a tendency to consider themselves smarter than everyone else--or at least, smarter than the person who wrote the platform they build on. Web developers have made a habit of this, but as Carter Sande [points out](https://carter.sande.duodecima.technology/javascript-page-navigation/), that just might not be the case.

> "I think it's best to build small, simple, standards-based web pages. Browser developers are really good at their jobs, and they've spent a lot of time on features like progressive rendering that help your sites feel fast without any effort on your part. It's not worth it to try and go behind their backs--premature optimizations like client-side navigation are hard to build, don't work very well, will probably be obsolete in a couple years, and make life worse for a decent portion of your users."
