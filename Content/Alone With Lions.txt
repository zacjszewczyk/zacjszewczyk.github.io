Jeff Kish is a contributing editor for [Gear Junkie](http://gearjunkie.com/), a great site that publishes articles about the outdoors and the gear we humans can use to best tackle it. For the past two months, Jeff has been on a mission to hike the Pacific Northwest Trail, and post regular updates and gear reviews along the way. With this report, he has finally crossed the halfway point, and so I felt that now was as good a time as any to post a link here: if you, like me, appreciate a good trail almost as much as a great work of prose, I encourage you to give [this series](http://gearjunkie.com/PNT) a look: it has both in good supply.
