I have devoted a lot of time to thinking about this, curious as to my motivations behind writing. In the past I said I wrote because I wanted to share my knowledge with others. How noble of me, I suppose. At other times, simply because I love the writer's craft. This was closer to the real reason, but neither, while true on some level, accurately represented the actual drive that has pushed me to come home after a long day and sit down to write rather than collapse in my bed, the motivation necessary to make that seven-to-eleven-o'clock--or ten-to-midnight, as is the case here--side project a viable business.  

I write because I don't want to sit in an office for eight to ten hours a day doing anything. I write because I want the freedom writing permits as one of the few things I can do anywhere in the world at whatever time I feel so inclined to put pen to paper, so to speak. I write because I love the writer's craft. I don't write for pageviews; the number of pageviews I get--incidentally very few, in case you were wondering--is a by-product of this and nothing more, not the driving force behind my fascination and love of this craft.
