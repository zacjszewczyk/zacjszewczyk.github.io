"Your job? You pick up the freshest, most interesting coffee from tiny roasters who do not drop ship (and of varieties not listed online from bigger roasters) and send them by request to customers around the world. Your customers trust you as a reporter and pay a small premium to have access to the strange diversity that surrounds you."

The first installment of Rich Stevens' handmade, artisanal newsletter list. It's been great fun so far; I look forward to each new release.
