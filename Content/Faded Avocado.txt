Working my way through The B&B Podcast's back catalog I came across episode seventy-three, *Faded Avocado*, during which Shawn and Ben talked about Marcelo Somer's piece [*The Linkblog Cancer*](http://behindcompanies.com/2012/08/the-linkblog-cancer/). This article sparked a controversy that went viral a few months ago, a controversy even the likes of [Jim Dalrymple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/09/linkblog-cancer/) and [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2012/08/09/linkblogs) felt the need to respond to. I even mentioned it, albeit briefly, in my article [*Reinventing the Linkblog*](Reinventing the Linkblog.txt).

For those curious, Ben and Shawn argued both sides very well and made a number of great points. If you have to pick one episode of The B&B Podcast to listen to, this is a good choice.
