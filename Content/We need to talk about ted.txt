I rarely find anything worthwhile on Hacker News--primarily interesting coding projects and the latest NSA story to catch the masses' attention, rarely anything substantive--but when I do come across something interesting it really is truly exceptional. This article from Benjamin Bratton is one of those excellent pieces, one for the record books. I can't wait to watch his talk.
