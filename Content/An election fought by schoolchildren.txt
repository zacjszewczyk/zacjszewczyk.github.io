Stories like this one from Craig Grannell remind me why I have been so reticent to enter the political landscape in any meaningful capacity up until now, a hesitancy [I outlined when linking to Ben Thompson's recent piece](The-Net-Neutrality-Wake-up-Call.htm) in which he called for greater political involvement for those in the technical professions. Everyone promises peace and to bring the soldiers home, but that will never happen: wars will forever wage on, and someone will always need stopped. The key difference between Craig's story and reality, though, is not the tactics or actions of the system's participants, but rather the end result when they invariably and inevitably fail to fulfill their promises: whereas his classmates held him and his cohorts accountable on the schoolyard, modern-day citizens--and Americans in particular, it seems--have no interest in holding anyone accountable for the promises on which they renege.
