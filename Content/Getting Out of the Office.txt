For the past three days, I've gotten out of "the office" to write, meaning instead of in my room where I usually write, I went outside and sat in the backyard. And it's done wonders for my work.

I've read articles suggesting such an exodus from the traditional place of work in the past, but never placed very much stock in them. I could write anywhere I wanted, I reasoned, I didn't need some trick to make writing easier. And while that was and still is true, that doesn't mean tricks like leaving the office or [writing a bad first draft](The Terrible First Draft.txt) aren't worth something.
