With all the talk of Huawei [over the last](Proxy Innovation.txt) [few days](Huawei and Managing 5G Risk.txt), I want to spend a minute on AT&T. You may have seen the company in the news for [expanding 5G to new cities](https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/09/att-5g-live-in-seven-more-cities/) [despite poor performance](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/22/opensignal-study-att-5g-e-speeds/). In short, [AT&T markets an optimized 4G LTE network as 5GE](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172355/att-fake-5g-logo-rolling-out-samsung-lg). Even if AT&T did offer actual 5G, [no U.S. devices could use it](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18303494/att-5g-service-19-cities-verizon-samsung-s10-exclusivity-tmobile-hot-spot); it does not. Huawei receives so much attention in this space because it is the first company to offer an actual 5G network, a feat no one else can match.
