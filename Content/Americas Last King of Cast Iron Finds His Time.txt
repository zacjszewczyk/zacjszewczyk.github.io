If you have never tried cooking with cast iron, you and everyone that has ever eaten with you are missing out: with the exception of boiling water, every single dish you can think of cooked with a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven turns out better than when made with a utensil of inferior materials, and everything is inferior to cast iron when it comes to cooking. Forget stainless steel, non-stick, and everything else: nothing holds a candle to this material. That's why I, personally, cook everything in a cast iron pan, and wouldn't even think of using anything else. So do yourself a favor and pick one of these up; I promise, you won't regret it.
