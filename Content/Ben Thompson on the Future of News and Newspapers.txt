Over the past week, Ben Thompson has posted a three-part series discussing the business of news, how that field relates to journalism and newspapers, and--by extension--the future of this profession and that industry. I have been a long-time fan of Ben's work, and these three articles are truly exceptional: insightful, fascinating, and--what's more--remarkably timely given the current state of news organizations. If you read nothing else this week, start with [*FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average*](http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/), move on to [*The Stages of Newspapers' Decline*](http://stratechery.com/2014/stages-newspapers-decline/), and finish with [*Newspapers Are Dead; Long Live Journalism*](http://stratechery.com/2014/newspapers-are-dead-long-live-journalism/). Truly fantastic work.
