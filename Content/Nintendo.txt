Moises writing about the three lingering problems plaguing Nintendo these days, and what he believes are the best solutions to those issues. In the last point under problem #2, "Nintendo isn't simple anymore", Moises introduces a concept he discussed with Horace on the eighty-third episode of The Critical Path, [*The Analyst Taxonomy*](http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/83): the idea of a [Nintendo phone](The 8-Bit Nintendo Phone.txt).  

    "If Nintendo is actually serious about staying in hardware, they should be developing a phone. That the most profitable gaming platform (mobile phones) completely lacks Nintendo software is bizarre.  

    "Their tablet platform already exists, and is attached to their set-top box. The same VirtualConsole-scale games could run on a phone with physical gameplay buttons, just as they do on the Wii U GamePad and the 3DS. They already make a mobile-scale OS, and have been doing so for years. Their classic games just don't work on phones that have no physical controls. If anyone can truly break through with a smart gamerphone, it would be Nintendo, but they show no interest whatsoever in this space."  

Throughout the article Moises drew a number of parallels between Nintendo and Apple, culminating with the suggestion that Nintendo come out and an offering not unlike the Apple TV to close the piece. As I said in [*The 8-Bit Nintendo Phone*](The 8-Bit Nintendo Phone.txt), such a comparison is not only apt but also very appropriate given the similarities between the two. I can only hope that those similarities extend beyond Nintendo's aptitude for hardware and software creation to the ability to disrupt existing markets with revolutionary new products.
