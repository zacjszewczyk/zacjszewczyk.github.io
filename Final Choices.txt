A third gem I [re](TBT Writing vs writing.txt)-[discovered](Dont Call Yourself a Programmer.txt), this time from [Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com/). In this post from 2010, he gets at something I did not understand until college. I look forward to explaining it soon in *Starting Over: The Gear I Would Buy if I Had to Do it All Over Again*, but in brief: you can either buy a nice thing once, or a cheap thing forever. Price does not necessairily indicate quality, but you will never find quality without paying for it.
