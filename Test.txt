Markdown Test Sheet
===================

I started with [John Gruber's syntax sheet](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text) and a plan to test my Markdown parser. With a few changes to highlight where First Crack fell short, I thought this would keep me from having to create a syntax sheet of my own. Trying to boil his down into a less verbose and more technical document, though, proved much harder than I had anticipated. After a few fruitless attempts, I gave in and started writing this. Check out [John's writeup](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text) if you want to know more about Markdown, but keep reading this if you want to know how First Crack's implementation differs.

## Overview

For the most part, First Crack's Markdown stays true to John Gruber's spec. It does differ some, though, and so here I will highlight those differences.

## Inline HTML and Special Characters

John Gruber's spec allows for inline HTML. First Crack does not. I could not think of any reason anyone <strong>would</strong> choose `<strong>bold</strong>` over `**bold**`. His spec also allows for
