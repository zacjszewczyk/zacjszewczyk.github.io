I linked to this piece by Ben Thompson in the title only because it is his most recent on the topic of disruption theory; I strongly encourage you to start with his earlier piece from last year titled "[What Clayton Christenson Got Wrong](http://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/)", where he more fully explains the theory and further expands upon some of its flaws. Especially if you--like me until now--only know of Disruption Theory in the abstract as explained in passing here and there, these two articles from Ben are a fantastic place to start.
