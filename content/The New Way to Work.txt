I've seen some [great critiques](We Need to Talk About TED video.txt) of TED in the past, but I really enjoyed Charlie Hoehn's talk from 2011 on free work--essentially, what amounted to "do what you love on nights and weekends until it becomes a viable business, then take it full-time." There is quite a bit more nuance to Charlie's approach though, so I strongly encourage you to check his video out. It's a bit long, but--as he said in closing--what do you have to lose?
