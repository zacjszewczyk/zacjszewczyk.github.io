Worth linking to again, courtesy of Dave Pell's The Next Draft this time around on the forty-fifth anniversary of Apollo 11's historic mission: the speech President Nixon plan to give in the event of a moon disaster. Incredible, and remarkable chilling:

> "Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace."
