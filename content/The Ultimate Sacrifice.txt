During September of last year I saw this incredible story pass by, but I let it go without comment. This time, however, I refused to make the same mistake.

It's so easy for us to sit in our homes decrying America's defense budget, and say things like, "I look forward to the day the Air Force has a bake sale in order to raise money." America's military is not some faceless organization used to enforce the will of politicians, though: these are real people who put their lives on the line every single day so that you do not have to; these are real people who willingly fly to their death for their fellow Americans. Yet so many have the audacity, the gall, to stand up and criticize those whom they have no right to call into question--their motivations, lifestyle, and everyday choices. And this infuriates me. Render respect where it is due.

For those of you still confused, it is due here.
