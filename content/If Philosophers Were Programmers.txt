With years of programming under my belt and currently taking a philosophy course, I found the parallels a blogger writing under the moniker "panefsky" drew between programming, philosophy, and specific philosophers interesting.

> "It is perfectly reasonable to consider the programming languages as the different philosophies of a virtual world, in which entities do exist and interact with each other. To this respect, even the fundamental philosophical questions receive an interesting transformation: For example 'What is self-conscience?' can be rephrased as 'What is reflection?'."
