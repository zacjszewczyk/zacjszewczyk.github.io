Back in January Linus Edwards started "The Podcasters", a series of articles in which he interviews podcast producers from all walks of life around the world. Beginning with Ben Alexander of [Fiat Lux](http://www.fiatlux.fm), continuing with [The Menu Bar](http://themenubar.net) and--more recently--[Life and Code and Stuff's](http://www.lifeandcodeandstuff.com) Andrew Clark, Linus just posted the third installment wherein he spoke with Slovenian podcaster Anze Tomic about the shows he does on [Apparatus](http://apparatus.si). If you glossed over these interviews when Linus started posting them, I encourage you to given them a chance: [Ben](http://vintagezen.com/2014/1/19/the-podcasters-1) and [Andrew](http://vintagezen.com/2014/1/27/the-podcasters-2) both had very interesting and tenuously-related answers to Linus's last question, "Would you like to change anything about your current podcasting setup?", and [Anze's](http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/2/3/the-podcasters-3) setup and his thoughts on equipment alone make the short interview worth reading.
