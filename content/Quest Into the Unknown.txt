"It's not, in other words, a matter of faith or belief, but a matter of interest. You train, you run the marathon, and then you take a week off and eat ice cream. Recovered, you start running again. There's no mystical hocus-pocus, no 'icy waters of skepticism.' Our hearts do not 'fail' when we gaze at our cycling shoes or the box of contractor bags or the stack of over-wintered tomato cages in the unplanted spring garden. We might sigh to ourselves, and we might procrastinate, but we don't go in for the Deus Deus Meus shit. At least, I don't."

An interesting opinion on procrastination. It might not be something outside of our control after all. Imagine that.
