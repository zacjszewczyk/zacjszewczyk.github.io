Two of my favorites. My only complaint is that he didn't make more.

For the uninitiated, That Phone Guy is an act of sorts Merlin grew semi-famous for a few years ago, in which he would mimick "that phone guy" by talking loudly and obnoxiously into his wallet, often either next to or in the very near vicinity of the one he was mocking. Absolutely hilarious.
