I work in a technical profession, writing code and inspecting network traffic all day--and I found Anuschka Rees' two-part series on garment quality fascinating. She approaches this topic as a technical one, with the exacting attention to detail I have come to appreciate in my line of work. I have devoted a lot of time to learning subtleties like these as a way to choose better adventure clothing, and could have seen myself writing something like this someday. Now I may never have to. Check out [part one here](https://anuschkarees.com/blog/2014/05/01/how-to-assess-the-quality-of-garments-a-beginners-guide-part-i/), and [part two here](https://anuschkarees.com/blog/2014/05/04/how-to-assess-the-quality-of-garments-a-beginners-guide-part-ii/). She also posted [a handy cheat sheet as well](http://into-mind.com/blog/2014/05/04/how-to-assess-the-quality-of-garments-a-beginners-guide-cheat-sheet/). Great stuff.
