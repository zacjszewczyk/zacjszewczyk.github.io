A smart person knows everything about a single topic. An intelligent person knows as much as possible about more than one topic. Both have great value, and depending on the industry, some organizations value [one more than the other](Smart versus intelligent.html). In general, though, smart people fill entry-level jobs, who then become intelligent people to move up the ladder[^1]. A robust personal development strategy will help you go from the former to the latter.

Effective personal development takes a lot of time and effort. To make this less complex, I broke it up into a four-step process. I also included several resources to get you started. 

1. **Choose topics to study.** Your profession may dictate that you focus on certain things. As a Soldier, you must learn military history and tactics; as a cyber Soldier, add technical topics to that list. After the things you have to study, look at your own interests to round it out: if you like programming, learn about it, too; if you like woodworking, include it.
2. **Find reliable resources from which to learn.** Once you know what you want to study, start searching for quality resources. You might not have any choice but to take a formal class, but do not discount the value a peer or supervisor can bring to the table. Most experts love to share knowledge. Many people at the top of their fields also like to write online, so do not discount the viability of an online course [or even a personal website](My Evening Reads.txt).
3. **Learn.** Once you know what you want to study and how you want to study it, do it. Real learning--the type that stays with you, and that you can use to become more intelligent--takes effort, as any [type of growth does](You cant lift.txt). Make a deliberate learning plan, then make a concerted effort to execute it.
4. **Use that knowledge.** Most people forget the last step in a solid personal development strategy, "**Use that knowledge**". If you do not learn something and then put it to good use, you will forget it--and in losing what you worked so hard to gain, you waste all that time, effort, and money. Do not make this mistake. If you learn a new skill, use it; if you learn something new, teach someone else. Just don't lose it.

These steps outline a process for personal development that will help you stay relevant in an ever-changing, ever-advancing domain. Take it to heart, implement it, and you will find yourself far ahead of your peers. I designed the list below, and chose the resources it comprises, with an audience of cyber Soldiers in mind. I plan to update it as I find new and worthwhile books, articles, and project ideas. I will also update the list as better resources surface, and take away the things that prove useless. Like my [morning](My Morning Reads.txt) and [evening](My Evening Reads.txt) reads, this is a living document--a reflection of the best knowledge I have on this subject to date.   

As a cyber Soldier, you must divide your personal development time between military, professional, and personal education. I call this a "one-third" model. Those unencumbered by the demands of the military may use a "one-half" model, where they split their time between personal and professional education. As a cyber Soldier, I divided the list below between those three areas, and further divide it into books and articles you can read, topics you can study, and projects you can try. The vast and complex nature of this space offers practitioners an easy excuse for ignoring adjacent fields and their place within any sort of a broader context. While this document features many resources that will aid in your technical development, it does not neglect those other topics. As David Heinemeier Hansson said in [*Programmings should stop celebrating incompetence*](https://world.hey.com/dhh/programmers-should-stop-celebrating-incompetence-de1a4725), "You can't become an expert at everything, and it's fine to accept your boundaries. But it's not fine to think you shouldn't be on some paths towards mastery." You do not have to master every topic here, but you should become familiar with all of them on your road to mastery of your chosen niche.

## 1/3 - Military Education

"Professional readings and study are not solely the responsibility of military schools. Individuals cannot afford to wait for attendance at a military school to begin a course of self-directed study. Military professionalism demands that individuals and units find time to increase their professional knowledge through professional reading, professional military education classes, and individual study." Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication 1-3: *Tactics*. Enough said.

### Books

Military leaders must read, understand, and live doctrine. These documents govern every aspect of military life, both on and off the battlefield. All soldiers should read the following Field Manuals (FM) and books. For more information, some have Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) versions, or Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) versions. These tend to consist of similar information presented in different ways, which can sometimes aid in the understanding of a difficult topic. Most Soldiers will read many FMs throughout the course of their military careers, but start with these books.

* [FM 6-22](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=83592), Leader Development. If you plan to go beyond the junior enlisted ranks, you should plan to spend a lot of time studying leadership. In particular, study the Army's take on leadership. You will find no shortage of books, articles, and speeches on this subject, but start here. This will give you a solid foundation upon which to build.
* [TC 3-21.76](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=1002065), Ranger Handbook. Every Soldier must maintain both technical *and* tactical proficiency, which--for cyber Soldiers--means at least understanding basic tactics. Don't treat it like the Bible, but rather as a more concise version of [FM](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=83905)/[ATP](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=106213) 3-21.8: The Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad. I like to take a laminated, pocket-sized version of the Ranger Handbook with me to the field. An understanding of basic military tactics is also important for cyber forces to bridge the gap between the fifth domain and kinetic ones.
* [ADP 1-02](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=1005278), Terms and Military Symbols. Coming up in the Cyber branch, I thought traditional military thinking had no place in the fifth domain. The military had evolved over thousands of years to control physical terrain, after all, and the fifth domain was almost entirely logical. No one ever bothered to correct me, but operational experience wasted no time in doing so. Relating these seemingly disparate fields requires a thorough understanding of both, not a willingness to undertake an exercise in futility. It is imperative that cyber Soldiers understand military science and apply it to cyber operations.
* [FM 3-90.1](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=103287), Offense and Defense, Volume 1. To help meld cyber warfare and with traditional doctrine, also see FM 3-90.1. This field manual explains offensive and defensive tactical tasks and their graphical representations, which helps translate cyber operations to traditional doctrine.
* [FM 3-90.2](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=103288), Reconnaissance, Security, and Tactical Enabling Tasks, Volume 2. FM 3-90.2 explains tactical enabling tasks and their graphical representations, for the same purpose as the manuals cited above.
* The Art of War, by Sun Tzu. Every military reading list has this book on it for a reason, and this list will, too: Sun Tzu's insightful observations on war and proven suggestions for its successful conduct have proven timeless. This short book takes just a few hours to read, yet its lessons will continue enduring for centuries. 
* Left of Bang, by Patrick van Horne. The paradigm-shifting Combat Hunter Program saved lives and increased the effectiveness of counter-insurgent operations. Defensive cyberspace operations forces must take a similar approach by not inspecting individual data points but rather looking at the entire picture to identify subtle clues indicative of malicious intent.
* The Mission, The Men, and Me, by Pete Blaber. Come for the war stories, stay for the lessons in leadership and professionalism. Throughout this book, Pete Blaber shares several valuable philosophies learned throughout his decorated Army career.
* Gates of Fire, by Steven Pressfield. A fictional retelling of the Spartan's stand at Thermopylae, this inspiring book paints a vivid picture of what it means to call oneself a warrior. 
* The Warrior Ethos, by Steven Pressfield. After many works of fiction featuring warriors across time and cultures, Steven Pressfield explores what it means to be a warrior, and what it takes to call yourself one. The military drills its ethoses into soldiers, but this handbook explains where those edicts come from and their importance in this profession.
* On Killing, by Dave Grossman. The profession of arms exists to provide nations with soldiers to fight and win their wars. This comes down to individuals from one nation destroying those who intend to do the same for their homeland. In *On Killing*, Dave Grossman takes a deep dive into this complex subject. Although given this document's target audience of cyber soldiers, this is not something most readers will ever encounter, understanding this is key to understanding the military profession.

### Articles

Look to unofficial sources for military education as well. Some people like to put doctrine on a pedestal, above all other sources of institutional knowledge, but humans write both. Find the good in each and learn from it. 

* [A Message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf), by Elbert Hubbard. This short essay from 1899 does a nice job of introducing Mission Command, or the idea that leaders ought to describe an end state and then allow their subordinates to use sound judgement and accept prudent risk to accomplish it. 
* [Auftragstaktik: A Case for Decentralized Battle](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a509971.pdf), by John T. Nelsen II. Here, John Nelsen opens with the conditions that lead the German Army to develop the Mission Command philosophy, and the steps it took to encourage junior leaders to exercise it. He then examines the state of Mission Command in the modern U.S. Army, and identifies the barriers that keep leaders from exercising it today.
* [Defense of Duffer's Drift](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/swinton.pdf), by Major General Sir Ernest Swinton. Set during the Boer War, this work of fiction follows Lieutenant Backsight Forethought and his platoon's defense of a natural river crossing. Over the course of six dreams, he learns to use critical thinking and strategy to hold his position until reinforcements arrive. 
* [Defense of Battle Position Duffer](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/docs/DOC-332615). CAC required. A modern-day adaptation of the Defense of Duffer's Drift, this version follows an Armor Brigade Combat Team through a similar scenario to illustrate the importance of the cyberspace domain alongside the traditional land, sea, air, and space domains.
* [It Takes a Network](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/21/it-takes-a-network/). General Stanley McChrystal wrote an interesting retrospective on his time commanding U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and the shift in thinking that had to occur to combat the insurgency there. Adopting Mission Command revolutionized warfare a century ago, and should this network-based approach take hold, perhaps it will revolutionize warfare for the next century.
* [F3EAD: Ops/Intel Fusion “Feeds” The SOF Targeting Process](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/f3ead-opsintel-fusion-%E2%80%9Cfeeds%E2%80%9D-the-sof-targeting-process). The Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate (F3EAD) framework blends intelligence and operations to enable rapid decision making at the tactical level. 
* [Trigger-Happy, Autonomous, and Disobedient: Nordbat 2 and Mission Command in Bosnia](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2017/9/20/trigger-happy-autonomous-and-disobedient-nordbat-2-and-mission-command-in-bosnia). This story gives us a glimpse at just how effective true mission command can be. It also shows us that fostering an environment conducive to decentralized initiative requires more than just leaders who pay lip service to the ideal. 

### Topics

* History. As members of the organization tasked with imposing this nation's will onto others, it is helpful to understand the historical context for the decisions made today. I prefer to study this topic not through books, but rather podcasts. Shows like Dan Carlin's [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) and Darryl Cooper's [Martyr Made](https://martyrmade.com/) draw from a variety of sources to paint a vivid picture of days long past. I cannot recommend these shows highly enough.

### Projects

* Build an SOP. In an organization as new as CYBERCOM, there's a good chance your team doesn't have one; on the off chance it does, you can at least add to, improve, or update it. Codify the things your team does right, and identify areas in need.
* Create a class. Find something your team is not good at, find the person in your organization who does that best, and get them to teach you so you can teach your team. 

### Newsletters

* [The Center of Junior Officers](https://juniorofficer.army.mil/) (CJO). The CJO is a phenomenal resource not just for new lieutenants, but especially for new lieutenants. It has great advice for handling many of the challenges junior officers face, and even offers helpful tips and templates for many of the classic 2LT challenges. Need advice on counseling an NCO? The CJO has it. Need a formal letter of introduction? The CJO has it. This is a severely underrated and underused resource that all company grade officers--and even some field grade officers--could benefit from.

## 1/3 - Professional Education

The Army expects all Soldiers to maintain both technical and tactical proficiency; industry expects civilians to stay near the front of their fields. Professional education will help make that happen for both. In general, pursue classes and certifications related to your field, and stay up to date on current events related to your domain. For cyber Soldiers in particular, I suggest studying these books, articles, and topics, and working on these projects: 

### Books

* [JP](https://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine/Joint-Doctrine-Pubs/3-0-Operations-Series/)/[FM](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=1002097) 3-12, Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare Operations. Most jobs have their own manual; read it. As of this writing, the current FM 3-12 focuses on tactical effects rather than offensive or defensive cyber. I recommend Soldiers review JP 3-12 for an overview of the cyber forces the Nation has at its disposal, and their different mission sets, but do not invest a great deal of time in either of these publications. They have not yet caught up to the operational reality.
* [CWP 3-33.4](https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/uscybercom/CWL/SitePages/Home.aspx). CAC required. This manual explains what cyber protection teams bring to the fight. Although written for combatant command commanders and their staffs, analysts at the lowest levels should also understand their intended purpose in the strategic picture.
* [The Tactical Employment of Cyber Protection Teams](https://gitlab.devforce.disa.mil/cpb/tec). This document is for the junior officers forever filling company-grade positions as Mission Element Leaders, who must direct their analysts in the detection of the most sophisticated hackers in the world; and for the Host, Network, and Intelligence Analysts arrayed against those actors, who must consistently combine world-class domain expertise with sound methodologies in the conduct of rigorous analysis. This document explains the operational employment of CPTs at their level, at the tactical edge.
* Cyber National Mission force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Based Hunting Methodology. Here, the Cyber National Mission force makes a good cases for identifying malicious activity by searching for specific Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Although presented as superior to IOC- and anomaly-based detections, no such hierarchy exists, and such delineations are superfluous--but this document still warrants a read.
* [Applied Thinking for Intelligence Analysis, by Charles Vandepeer.pdf](https://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Applied-Thinking-for-Intelligence-Analysis). Charles Vandepeer talks about the difficulties of intelligence analysis, and ways to overcome them. His book also includes an explanation of several formal methods to aid in the creation of sound assessments.
* How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk, by Douglas Hubbard and Richard Seiersen.Although the nominal topic of their book would seem to fall outside the purview of most cyber forces, this book is actually about the broader debate between qualitative versus quantitative methods. This debate, and the authors’ well-founded preference for the latter, is directly applicable to defensive cyberspace operations, and further supports the use of a formal analytic methodology.
* The Checklist Manifesto, by Atul Gawande. Many professionals overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the impact basic improvements can have on their work. In *The Checklist Manifesto*, renowned surgeon Atul Gawande explains how the simple adoption of a checklist drastically improved patient care. A similar approach could be applied in other fields, and in cyberspace operations in particular, to similarly significant results.
* Intelligence-Driven Incident Response, by Scott Roberts and Rebekah Brown. Soldiers from the kinetic domains expect intelligence to drive cyberspace operations. This book describes a viable approach to this elusive process.
* 2034: A Novel of the Next World War, by Elliot Ackerman and Admiral James Stavridis. This fictional recount of a great power conflict between the United States and China provides a possible glimpse into a likely future. Although many hold up *Ghost Fleet* by P.W. Singer and August Cole as **the** book on World War III and the role of cyberspace operations in it, *2034* does a better job of describing both.
* [The Cyber Defense Review](https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/). Although not a physical book, these book-length compilations from the Army Cyber Institute at West Point cover topics ranging from the technical to the philosophical. 
* Blue Team Field Manual, by Alan White and Ben Clark. Think of this book as a cheat sheet for common defender or incident responder actions like mapping a network, checking for unusual user login events, and capturing network traffic. If you have to work without a reliable internet connection, or just don’t went to sift through Stack Overflow questions often, consider this instead. You may also find value here in novel tactics, techniques, or procedures. 
* Red Team Field Manual, by Ben Clark. The same type of book except written for the attacker rather than the defender, I suggest checking this out regardless of the side on which you work. Defensive measures do not have to be a shot in the dark: understand the ways an adversary might attempt to break in so you can close off those likely avenues of approach. 

### Articles

* [A Framework for Cyber Threat Hunting](https://www.threathunting.net/files/framework-for-threat-hunting-whitepaper.pdf). For a simple guide to take a new, immature threat hunting group to a mature, effective team, see this succinct whitepaper from the now-defunct cybersecurity company Sqrrl. For another measure of hunting maturity, check out the [Security Operations Center (SOC) Capability Maturity Measurement (CCM)](https://www.soc-cmm.com/) and its accompanying whitepaper, [*SOC-CMM: Measuring Capability Maturity in Security Operations Centers*](https://www.soc-cmm.com/downloads/soc-cmm%20whitepaper.pdf). ThreatConnect's [Threat Hunting Maturity Model](https://threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/19-TC-Maturing-a-Threat-Intelligence-Program-Whitepaper-Web.pdf) also does a nice job of explaining this concept.
* [A Tradecraft Primer: Structured Analytic Techniques for Improving Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/publications-rss-updates/tradecraft-primer-may-4-2009.html). Technical analysts must not discount the importance of sound analytic techniques; the CIA's tradecraft primer provide easy an introductions to these valuable methodologies. See [ICD 203: Analytic Standards](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf) for another helpful document to aid in the production of sound intelligence estimates.
* [Assessing the Tradecraft of Intelligence Analysis, by Gregory Treverton and Bryan Gabbard](https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR293.html). The RAND Corporation highlights the challenges of producing rigorous analysis, and the current efforts of the Intelligence Community to counter them.
* [Assessing the Value of Structured Analytic Techniques in the U.S. Intelligence Community, by Stephen Artner, Richard S. Girven, and James B. Bruce](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1408.html). One of the Intelligence Community's main efforts to address the problems highlighted in reports like *Assessing the Tradecraft of Intelligence Analysis* was the development and widespread adoption of Structured Analytic Techniques, or SATs. This report attempts to quantify their effectiveness.
* [ATT&CKing Threat Management: A unfocused Methodology for Cyber Threat Analysis by Andy Piazza](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threatintelligence/paper/39090). Andy Piazza provides a thorough review of cyber threat frameworks, cyber threat intelligence, and the proper application of the former to the latter. For an excellent use of MITRE's ATT&CK Framework, read this piece. See also his follow-up blog post on the same topic: [ATT&CKing Threat Management, by Andy Piazza on Medium](https://medium.com/@andy.c.piazza/att-cking-threat-management-d004f70cd24b).
* [Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts](https://www.lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents-soup-nuts-0). Herb Lin's examination of attribution in the fifth domain delves into several important factors. Although definitive attribution is unlikely, so is complete obfuscation; analysts must take heart in that.
* [Bearing Witness: Uncovering the Logic Behind Russian Military Cyber Operations](https://www.boozallen.com/c/insight/blog/russian-military-cyber-operations-in-context.html). For an in-depth examination of the motives behind Russian cyber operations, see this 2020 Booz Allen Hamilton report. This document is a rare strategic level intelligence assessment, as opposed to the much more common tactical or operational intelligence.
* Cases in Intelligence Analysis: Structured Analytic Techniques in Action, by Sarah Miller Beebe and Randolph H. Pherson. This informative book starts out with a hard look at the problems with historical approaches to intelligence analysis, then walks its readers through several scenarios that teach them to use Structured Analytic Techniques to do better. Look here for a more in-depth discussion of the Structured Analytic Techniques other documents in this list mention in brief.
* [Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree, by Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26798603_Conditions_for_Intuitive_Expertise_A_Failure_to_Disagree). Here the authors argue that algorithms "significantly outperform humans" in deterministic environments--precisely the environment in which analysts operate. This study provides further evidence supporting the adoption of formal analytic methodologies for those who resist. Domain expertise is a necessary but insufficient component of thorough analysis. Success requires blanket excellence and relentless progress, which formal methodologies enable.
* [Cyber Threat Framework](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/cyber-threat-framework). The Office of the Director of National Intelligence's Cyber Threat Framework provides another way to explain adversarial activity over time, with more general stages than other frameworks. I like to use MITRE's framework at the micro level, and this one at the macro level.
* [Endgame's Guide to Threat Hunting, by Paul Ewing and Devon Kerr](https://cyber-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Endgames-Guide-to-Threat-Hunting.pdf). Although written in 2018, this methodology retains some value to this day.
* [Generating Hypotheses for Successful Threat Hunting, by Robert Lee and David Bianco](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threats/generating-hypotheses-successful-threat-hunting-37172). Whether executing an focused or unfocused hunt, analysts must use a hypothesis-driven approach in which an initial question prompts an iterative search through the available data sets. Robert Lee and David Bianco delve into this type of approach here.
* [Hunt Evil: Your Practical Guide to Threat Hunting](https://www.threathunting.net/files/hunt-evil-practical-guide-threat-hunting.pdf). For a more in-depth guide than Sqrrl's \textit{A Framework for Cyber Threat Hunting} for taking a new, immature threat hunting group to a mature, effective team, check out this book.
* [Measuring and Improving Cyber Defense Using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, by John Hubbard](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threats/paper/39685). In this SANS whitepaper, John Hubbard uses the MITRE ATT&CK Framework not to depict adversary activity in the most common use of the matrix, but instead to highlight gaps in the defenders' visibility. 
* [No Silver Bullet by Frederick Brooks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220477127_No_Silver_Bullet_Essence_and_Accidents_of_Software_Engineering). Frederick Brooks' words, and this concept, are just as applicable in the fifth domain as in software engineering: in Cyber, too, there is no silver bullet; the closest thing we will get to one in the execution of sound analysis is fostering expertise throughout our ranks. 
* [TaHiTI - a threat hunting methodology](https://www.betaalvereniging.nl/en/safety/tahiti/). Check out the Dutch Payments Association's approach to threat hunting for another viable alternative. See also the more concise [TaHiTI - a threat hunting methodology whitepaper](https://www.betaalvereniging.nl/en/safety/tahiti/).
* [The Unified Kill Chain by Paul Pols](https://www.csacademy.nl/images/scripties/2018/Paul-Pols---The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf). Paul Pols compares and contrasts several cyber threat frameworks before presenting the Unified Kill Chain, which attempts to address some of the weaknesses in Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE's ATT&CK Matrix.
* [Understanding Rigor in Information Analysis](http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/productions/intelligence/1_Patterns/Rigorous_Process/ZelikEtAl2007_UnderstandingRigorInInformationAnalysis.pdf). This document attempts to describe the things this organization does well, and prescribe a better way for things it does not--but do not consider this \textit{the} way. As Daniel Zelik et. al. explain in this paper, rigor is a measure of sufficiency, not a measure of process deviation.
* [Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf). Eric M. Hutchins, Michael J. Cloppert, and Rohan M. Amin highlight the importance of integrating intelligence into defensive cyber operations, particularly when dealing with Advanced Persistent Threats. 
* [I Have a Fever, and the Only Cure for It Is More Feedback](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/i-have-a-fever-and-the-only-cure-for-it-is-more-feedback.html). In this great Splunk blog post, John Stoner explains a key component of successful threat hunting processes: acting on the bad we discover. This is a key step to maturing your organization’s ability to hunt well. This is just part seventeen in Splunk's [Hunting with Splunk: The Basics](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/hunting-with-splunk-the-basics.html) series, so check that out for more great content.
* [ATT&CK-ing the Adversary: Episode 1 - A New Hope](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2019/01/15/att-ck-ing-the-adversary-episode-1-a-new-hope.html). Everyone likes to talk about the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, but few understand it well. This piece, and the two below it, form a helpful three-part series that will teach you about this useful tool, and show you practical examples of how to use it in your organization.
* [ATT&CK-ing the Adversary: Episode 2 - Hunting with ATT&CK in Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2019/02/04/att-ck-ing-the-adversary-episode-2-hunting-with-att-ck-in-splunk.html).
* [ATT&CK-ing the Adversary: Episode 3 – Operationalizing ATT&CK with Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2019/02/08/att-ck-ing-the-adversary-episode-3-operationalizing-att-ck-with-splunk.html).
* [Simple Systems Have Less Downtime](https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/). Few take the time to architect secure systems from the start. This leads to the messes we then have to fix, once the patchwork of legacy systems that they cobbled together over a decade leads to an inevitable compromise. Here, Greg Kogan makes case for simple systems instead--a case we should make as well, and strive to implement as much as possible.
* [Software Architecture is Overrated](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-architecture-is-overrated/). The larger point Gergely Orosz makes here, that leaders should focus on developing *a* plan that all can understand and execute rather than *a certain* one according to supposed best practices, is something everyone should keep in mind. I have seen many approach projects by building out a plan according to a certain model, which just slowed down the process. Best practices exist for a reason, but blind adherence to them does no one any good. 
* [A New Approach to Enterprise Security](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43231.pdf). In our capacity as incident responders, we seldom have the opportunity to re-architect networks post-compromise. Fortunately, though, we often get this chance later on. This 2014 article from Google on its implementation of zero trust networks should serve as a guide. The old model of castles and moats is insufficient: the adversary will cross the moat, breach the walls, and with free reign inside wreak havoc. This zero trust networking strategy makes each step in that process much more difficult--which, in this domain, is the best we can do.
* [Hypermodeling Hyperproperties](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/hyperproperties/). Programming, and a great deal of cybersecurity, involves hyperproperties: ensuring good things always happen, and that bad things never do. Hillel Wayne wrote a nice introduction to this concept. Even if the code samples don't help, his explanation, examples, and resources will make you better at both.
* [On architecture, urban planning and software construction](http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/). On the topic of programming, Tomas Petricek has an interesting idea for moving the computer science discipline forward: drawing lessons from architecture and urban planning. The observations he presents here are a good start. 
* [Classic Mistakes](https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/classic-mistakes/). Best practices tend to apply across industries. Steve McConnell's examination of *worst* practices in software development also applies across industries. Things like "Abandoning planning under pressure" and "Overly aggressive schedules" can drag any team down, so learn to identify these so that you can avoid them. 
* [Complexity Has to Live Somewhere](https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html). A great deal of work, even in this organization, goes toward reducing complexity--or trying to, at least. As Fred Herbert explains here, though, complexity never actually disappears, it just gets shifted around until "with nowhere to go, it has to roam everywhere in your system, both in your code and in people's heads. And as people shift around and leave, our understanding of it erodes." I believe in building systems as simple as possible, but no simpler. Understand the limits of this pursuit, and the real cost of taking it to the extreme. 
* [Write a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). Everyone gets evaluated. In the Army, those take the form of regular counsellings. To make your supervisor's job easier, and to make you look great, keep a list of things you did since your last evaluation. I do my best to keep track of everything my Soldiers do, but this has proven much more effective.
* [Computers can be understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/). Modern computers have gotten so complex that the prospect of trying to understand them intimidates a lot of people. Unfortunately, many use that fear as an excuse not to even try. As professionals, though, we have a responsibility to develop this expertise. Nelson Elhage has some good advice for tackling this gargantuan task.
* [They don't even know the fundamentals](https://blog.royalsloth.eu/posts/they-dont-even-know-the-fundamentals/). Here the author argues that “the fundamentals” are knowable but not necessary for everyone: “one man’s fundamentals are another man’s trivia.” This is a nice counterpoint to *Computers Can be Understood*, which makes the case for developing that broad expertise.
* [Understanding Rigor in Information Analysis](http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/productions/intelligence/1_Patterns/Rigorous_Process/ZelikEtAl2007_UnderstandingRigorInInformationAnalysis.pdf). Daniel Zelik, Emily Patterson, and David Woods discuss the challenge of executing rigorous analysis in increasingly complex fields. Their assessment--and their conclusions--are particularly relevant to Analysts in the Fifth Domain.
* [Operators, EDR Sensors, and OODA Loops](http://jackson-t.ca/ooda-loops.html). This article not only explains John Boyd's OODA as it applies to operators in the fifth domain, Jackson also walks through its practical application to cyberspace operations. This is a fantastic read, and one of the rare works that bridges the gap between conventional military knowledge and cyber.

### Topics

#### Windows Active Directory

* Understand forests, trees, and domains. Learn their differences, how they can interact, and what they consist of.
* Understand the five classes of services Active Directory provides.
* Understand Group Policy. 

#### Authentication Methods 

* Understand Kerberos at a step-by-step level, and explain the difference between a ticket-granting ticket and a ticket-granting service. 
* Understand Kerberos vulnerabilities. I like [The Bible of Kerberos Attacks](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/) as a starting point. [Detecting Forged Kerberos Ticket (Golden Ticket &#038; Silver Ticket) Use in Active Directory &#8211; Active Directory Security](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1515) is a good resource as well.
* Understand NTLM at a step-by-step level.
* Understand NTLM vulnerabilities, and learn the advantages of Kerberos over it.
* Learn about common Windows services that use Kerberos and NTLM. Know which they prefer, and what they fall back on and the circumstances under which they do. 

### Projects

* Coming soon: Professional development projects.

## 1/3 - Personal Education

No matter how much you love your job, I encourage you to read, write, develop personal projects, and pursue your own interests--especially if they lie outside the cyber domain. Technical people in particular seem to have a tendency to work in front of a screen all day, then do the same at home. Find something to do with your hands--or, if you work with your hands all day, think about switching it up at home. I recommend reading these books and articles, and working on these projects.

### Books

* How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie. Many like to make fun of this book, but whether leading a team or building a professional network, relationships become more important the more your career progresses. Learn to craft them well, now.
* Extreme Ownership, by Jocko Willink. The best book on leadership I have ever read. It informs my leadership philosophy to this day. Jocko goes into even more depth on [his excellent podcast](http://jockopodcast.com/), so check that out as well. He also wrote a similar "field manual", *Discipline Equals Freedom*, that you may find interesting, too. Many of his lessons apply to life in general, so I cannot recommend these enough.
* The Elements of Style, by Strunk & White. Good writing takes a lot of time and energy. Becoming a good writer takes an immense amount of both, and so most never get there. In this classic, William Strunk and E.B. White explain some simple ways to write well. Becoming a good writer is one of the most significant steps a person can take to better themselves, and this book will help.
* On Writing Well, by William Zinsser. For those looking to move beyond the simple steps in *The Elements of Style*, William Zinsser has some fantastic advice about how to become a good writer, and how to approach becoming a good writer. 
* [The Problem of the Problem](http://www.writingcenter.emory.edu/documents/mcenerney-problem-of-the-problem.pdf). Framed as an explanation of the function and value of academic writing, I almost ignored this short book by Larry McEnerney. I have made my distaste for academia no secret. I gave it a try, though, and I walked away glad that I did: In *The Problem of the Problem*, Larry highlights the importance of identifying the value a written work provides and then offers concrete suggestions for making that clear. This prompted me to make some much-needed edits across several documents. Following these guidelines will lead to a marked improvement in your written works.

### Articles

* [Work is Work](https://codahale.com/work-is-work/). Understanding how large organizations work, and the things that *actually* make them succeed or fail, is **immeasurably** valuable. I consider this piece from Coda Hale the seminal article on the subject of organizational theory. Use this knowledge to better navigate, and effect meaningful change in, your place of work. I found the section “Hell is Other People” particularly enlightening in a place that loves meetings, as someone who does not. I encourage all to try to better their organization, and consider it imperative that leaders--and Officers in particular--do all in their power to optimize their environment for success.
* [Embrace the Grind](https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/). Jacob Kaplan-Moss with a good reminder on the importance of doing things the hard way.
* [How to Write Usefully](http://paulgraham.com/useful.html). One of the most important and impactful things you will do in any organization is communicate, often in writing. Paul Graham offers some great advice for writing well here. In [a related article](https://snir.dev/blog/remote-async-communication/), Snir David makes a good case that most communication should take place this way. 
* [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/). Out of all of Patrick McKenzie's great work, if you read just one article, read this one. He has some fantastic advice for those just starting their careers that even senior Soldiers entering the civilian workforce will find helpful. 
* [How to Ask for Feedback](https://www.samjulien.com/how-to-ask-for-feedback). Sam Julien offers some advice for asking for feedback. 
* [Growth hacks: coffee with an experienced engineer you don't know](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/growth-hacks-coffee-with-an-engineer/). Find a way to have smart conversations with smart people. You will both learn a lot, and talking through whatever challenges you both face will help you work through them.
* [What do executives do, anyway?](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201909). Substitute "executives" for "leaders", and this becomes an explanation of the role senior leaders play and a cautionary tale for the consequences when they fail to do that job well. Understand both and use this knowledge to help inform your career goals. 
* [Becoming a Better Developer](https://gist.github.com/prakhar1989/1b0a2c9849b2e1e912fb). As a counterpoint to [a piece by Jason Rudolph](https://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/#comment-287120251), Rick Hickey shares his thoughts on becoming a better developer. Where Jason believes many varied experiences lead to mastery, a belief the Army shares in its “up or out” model, Rick argues that depth--rather than breadth--will get you there. I tend to agree with Rick when it comes to technical fields, although Jason has the right idea for generalists. Understand the different approaches, and the different results they achieve, so you can 1) reach your goals, and 2) recognize when someone puts you on the wrong path. [It takes six to ten years of focused effort to become a master](https://zenhabits.net/the-only-way-to-become-amazingly-great-at-something/) (although [some disagree](https://thecorrespondent.com/337/why-hard-work-and-specialising-early-is-not-a-recipe-for-success/44615161074-4a7c370a), do not trust those who tell you otherwise. "master" is not necessarily the same as "Master". See also: [The Shortcut Is: There is no Shortcut](https://www.outsideonline.com/2268921/shortcut-there-no-shortcut). 
* [The dark shadow in the injunction to 'do what you love'](https://aeon.co/ideas/the-dark-shadow-in-the-injunction-to-do-what-you-love). Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs purported to give managers a roadmap to employee buy-in. In this piece, Kira Lussier explores Maslow's theory, its implications, and its (unintentional) consequences. 
* [You don't need to work on hard problems](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard). The Cyber branch as a serious retention problem. There are a lot of reasons for this. Setting aside the well-justified complaints of those stuck doing non-technical work, though, I disagree with one of the most common reasons Soldiers leave: they want to solve "hard" problems. In this piece, Ben Kuhn makes the case that you, like him, might actually have a different goal--and that with some introspection, you might discover it and find newfound meaning in your job.
* [How to waste your career, one comfortable year at a time](https://apoorvagovind.substack.com/p/how-to-waste-your-career-one-comfortable). Apoorva Govind argues that when it comes to your career, complacency is cancer. I have met many Soldiers, Officers and Enlisted alike, who complain that they don't get to work on cool things; every time they got an opportunity to excel, go above and beyond, or take on additional duties, though, they declined. Their complacency first killed their motivation, and then their careers.
* [Advice to my young self: to succeed in your career, forget side projects and focus on your job](https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/focus-on-jour-job/). Manuel Darcemont argues that excelling at your actual job, rather than doing mediocre work with a lot of (interesting) side projects, is the key to a successful career. While I agree, I also believe that those side projects are the key to moving from where you are to where you want to be. To go back to the example of the Soldiers stuck in uninteresting jobs, step #1 toward getting to those cool jobs is *crushing* your day job; step #2 is showing an aptitude for those cool jobs with the things you work on at night and on the weekends. Be so good that they can't ignore you, and they won't.
* [How to Work Hard](http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html). I hear this most often about feats of strength, but also about other traits like intelligence and work ethic--"That person can do it, but I can't." The idea that success comes down to a simple question of innate ability is a comforting one. You have it, or you don't. What better way to excuse mediocrity? But as Paul Graham explains here, success requires at least two of these traits: natural ability, practice, and effort. Don't take yourself out of the running just because you don't have all three.
* [Beyond Smart](http://www.paulgraham.com/smart.html). Paul Graham argues that intelligence, what many consider an end in and of itself, is actually a necessary but insufficient requirement for discovery--the truly meaningful goal. It’s an interesting idea, and he makes sound recommendations for areas of self-improvement to reach that goal.
* [Willingness to Look Stupid](https://danluu.com/look-stupid/). Dan Luu’s willingness to look stupid has served him remarkably well, and in the context of this document on personal, professional, and military development, his advice is especially important. Early in their careers, many make a speed run of climbing Dunning-Kruger’s first peak--“Mount Stupid”; it takes most people years to overcome their insecurities, accept the complexities of their field, and begin the long climb to excellence. It does not have to.
* [Focusing on the Goal](https://redteams.net/redteaming/2016/focusing-on-the-goal). The mission comes first, and accomplishing the mission in austere and rapidly changing environments means adapting and overcoming obstacles quickly and efficiently. 
* [Procrastination](https://shawnblanc.net/2015/02/procrastination/). Independent full-time blogger Shawn Blanc talks about the insidious nature of procrastination, its false promises, and some concrete strategies for combating it.
* [How to Collaborate with People You Don't Like](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-to-collaborate-with-people-you-dont-like). The unfortunate reality of the situation is this: you will come across many people in your career that you do not like, and you will have to work with many of them. Mark Nevins offers some concrete advice to make sure this unpleasant process goes well; I encourage you to take it.
* [The Fucks and How We Give Them](https://patrickrhone.com/2014/06/12/the-fucks-and-how-we-give-them-a-manifesto/). On the topic of having to do things you will not like, here Patrick Rhone talks about managing the one aspect of your life completely within your control: yourself. Take his advice: care about the things you must, and stop investing emotion in things you do not have to, or over which you have no control.
* [On National and Enterprise Outsourcing](http://berthub.eu/articles/posts/national-outsourcing/). Bert Hubert makes the case that outsourcing has obvious short-term benefits but serious long-term downsides, regardless of whether it takes place in a company or at the national level, and I tend to agree. As a nation, for the most part we have just seen the former; in the coming years, we can look forward to the pain of the latter as the payment for this far too widespread and pervasive practice comes due. There is also a dangerous point to be made about the cost of outsourcing a great deal of the capability development in this organization to defense contractors, but I will leave that for you to discover. **Note:** Bert accidentally published a draft of this post, which I read for this entry, that he then took down; the finished post may not be available yet. 
* [Out-Sourced Profits: The Cornerstone of Successful Subcontracting](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9da/f5cc1c94c6e34e29095ca168e8fa2d750df9.pdf). In a 2001 study written for Boeing, Dr. L. J. Hart-Smith takes a hard look at the true value of outsourcing and comes to a similar conclusion as Bert Hubert in the article above. I encourage you to read [*Work is Work*](https://codahale.com/work-is-work/), to best understand Dr. Hart-Smith's point that while outsourcing may appear to lower monetary costs, the *organizational* cost is remarkable.
* [Build versus buy](https://lethain.com/build-vs-buy/). The last two articles talk about the downsides of outsourcing; in this one, Will Larson talks about a straightforward process for weighing outsourcing's costs against its benefits.
* [Reshoring Supply Chains: A Practical Policy Agenda](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/05/reshoring-supply-chains-a-practical-policy-agenda/). David Adler and Dan Breznitz, in the American Affairs Journal, discuss the issue of enterprise outsourcing in America and offer some concrete policy suggestions for fixing it. I find this issue fascinating and applicable at a much lower level than strategic national security: I see outsourcing take place even amongst my team, to similar effects. 
* [All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://bellmar.medium.com/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f). Marianne Bellotti's describes five insightful statements and how they impacted her work as a manager of engineers. 
* [How to build silos and decrease collaboration (on purpose)](https://www.rubick.com/how-to-build-silos-and-decrease-collaboration/). Jade Rubick’s fantastically interesting take on silos and collaboration challenges the widespread assumption that the former are inherently bad and the latter is inherently good. I consider this a must-read for anyone entering mid- or upper-level management. 
* [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/). Perhaps the single greatest source of lessons in personal development, Farnam Street topics range from [the OODA loop](https://fs.blog/2021/03/ooda-loop/) and [other](https://fs.blog/2017/04/get-smart-brian-tracy/) [techniques](https://fs.blog/2021/03/thinking-rate-fixed/) for [making sound decisions](https://fs.blog/2021/03/avoid-bad-decisions/) to the use of [mental models for rapid and effective decision making](https://fs.blog/2016/09/what-are-you-doing-about-it/) to discussions of [the value of feedback](https://fs.blog/2021/03/feedback-change/) and [how best](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/) to [act on it](https://fs.blog/2018/03/half-life/). Start with those articles, or work your way through [the site's most popular posts](https://fs.blog/best-articles/). You cannot go wrong with this excellent resource.
* [Individuals Matter](https://danluu.com/people-matter/). Dan Luu discusses the high costs of treating people as fungible. I found this especially interesting given my background in the military, which operates on the foundational assumption that people are commodities that can, should, and in fact *must* be moved around frequently. While the Army's penchant for fungibility stems from the strategic leader initiative, private industry has no such excuse.
* [Keeping Up with Current Events](/blog/my-morning-reads.html). Back in 2019, as a precursor to this project, I sat down to catalog all the websites I visit every day to keep up with current events. I update this living document as I find new sources, or stop paying attention to old ones. Those of you who want to stay well-informed, but do not know where to start, may find this article helpful.
* [My Evening Reads](/blog/my-evening-reads.html). I visit the handful of high-volume websites in [*Keeping Up with Current Events*](/blog/my-morning-reads.html) a few times a day; this article catalogs the much larger number of lower-volume, mostly independent websites I follow that post such high-quality content that I do not want to miss a single article. I also update this living document as I find new sources, or stop paying attention to old ones. I recommend using this list, in conjunction with the previous one, to start building a well-rounded and effective news aggregation strategy.


### Topics

* Coming soon: Personal development topics to study.

### Projects

* Woodworking. I love woodworking, and I think everyone should give it a try. Here's why:
    * Low startup costs. Start with a hammer, a saw, and some nails. For less than $50, you can decide if you like woodworking. Invest in a decent drill, too, and something like a patio pergola--which hovers around $1,000 retail--becomes doable for a fraction of the cost.
    * Wood is cheap. A simple and sturdy shelf, eight feet long and three levels high, will set you back about $50. You can also dent, scrape, and trash these boards, and recover from anything except cutting one too short. This lowers the barrier to starting new projects, encourages experimentation, and puts the price of making a mistake--of learning--at about $3. 
    * If you can dream it, you can build it. I see a lot of people jump right to steel or aluminum, [but for most projects](/projects.html#cadd), wood will work [just as well](http://mechanicallumber.com/desk-plans/). Using wood also means you can design exactly what you want, and since you finish it yourself, the product will end up looking much better.
* LEGO Robotics. If you have a bit more money to spend or kids in the house, or want some of the same benefits of woodworking from a more technical hobby, give LEGO robotics a try. It will cost more to get started, but less in the long term, and you can take on more technical projects at a smaller scale. I like to use LEGOs to test designs before I mock them up in SketchUp, on my way to building them with wood. 

There's a saying, "He not busy being born is busy dying." Something similar applies in the cyber domain: "He not busy learning is not busy at all." In a field based on complex technologies and full of remarkably smart people, the only way to stay relevant--to stay employed--is to become a lifelong learner. This habit takes a lifetime to build, but you can start by taking an active role in your personal development. 

[>1] Consider the best network administrator in the world. That skill alone does not generate revenue, so he or she must work for someone else. If, instead, this person sits at the top of the org chart in their own company, they have made themselves a generalist, with skills in other areas; that has come at the cost of being the best network administrator in the world, though. Someone else, who does nothing but administer networks, now has that title.
