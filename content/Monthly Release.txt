If you looked at [First Crack's](/projects.html#firstCrack) internal commit history, you would see that most features take at most a few days to write. Even the entirety of [First Crack's rewrite](First Crack Release Notes 0220.txt) happened over the course of a couple weeks, in the mornings before work and on the weekends. I have stuck with monthly releases since [June of last year](First Crack Release Notes 0619.txt), though, and today I want to explain why.

As I said [last year](First Crack Release Notes 0619.txt), I started posting monthly release notes, instead of using a traditional versioning system, because the latter implied a cycle of feature integration-feedback-improvement for which I had neither the user base nor the inclination. I also did not want to take such a formal approach to a hobby I work in in my spare time. Still wanting to talk about new features, though, in June I began the series laid out in the list below.

* [First Crack Release Notes, June 2019](First Crack Release Notes 0619.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, July 2019](First Crack Release Notes 0719.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, August 2019](First Crack Release Notes 0819.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, September 2019](First Crack Release Notes 0919.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, October 2019](First Crack Release Notes 1019.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, November 2019](First Crack Release Notes 1119.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, December 2019](First Crack Release Notes 1219.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, February 2020](First Crack Release Notes 0220.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, March 2020](First Crack Release Notes 0320.txt)
* [First Crack Release Notes, April 2020](First Crack Release Notes 0420.txt)

Had I decided on a shorter release schedule--even one as small as a week, for example--most major features would have still fit within a single development window. I went with an entire month instead, though, for three reasons:

1. **Regularity**. I can almost always get *something* done over the course of a month, but I felt less confident about committing to getting something done every week. Things happen; a compressed timeline would have given me less flexibility to account for them. 
2. **Overhead**. It takes a non-insignificant amount of work to write the release notes; batching these jobs allows me to minimize overhead.
3. **Accountability**. Declaring that I would do *some* work on First Crack each month, and that I would then share it with the world, keeps the project moving forward. Although a benefit to any release schedule, month-long development windows make it tough for me to excuse a lack of progress. As I said, things happen--but they seldom happen for an entire month.

This strategy has worked well for me. Almost a year later, First Crack has gone from a personal hobby to a polished blog engine. As I have continued to grow as a developer, so, too, has this project. I hope you will [check it out](https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/firstcrack), or just stick around for next month's release.
