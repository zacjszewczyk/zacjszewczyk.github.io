I have read a lot of Aaron and Jen's work, but it took [this video](https://www.outsideonline.com/2401891/airstream-flying-cloud-tour) to make me realize how nice they had it. Their Airstream-Silverado combo makes for a great setup, which made me re-think [my plan](/projects.html#lmtvRV) to build an LMTV-based RV. With $40,000 for a used Airstream, though, plus another $30,000 for a used truck to pull it, I would spend more going this route and get a less capable setup. The M1083 will give me more living space atop a chassis that can go almost anywhere--and a trailer, no matter how slick, [just can't compete with that](Expedition Rigs.txt).
