I accidentally re-discovered this article last night as I was writing [*This Post is Not About the 128GB iPad 4*](The 128GB iPad 4.txt), as I was looking for the link to [Ben Brooks's knife reviews](http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/knife-follow-up/). #20 is probably my favorite:

> "Don't give a shit about what people think of your honest opinion. If you think Android is better than iOS, Windows better than Mac, and Nikon better than Canon -- so be it. You'd be wrong, but at least you're standing for what you believe in, and that's more important."

Pandering came to mind the first time I read this and once again this time around. Something to keep in mind as you produce any sort of content attracting widespread attention and thus widespread criticism as well.
