Drew DeVault on the dangers of using a virtual private network, or VPN:

> "[VPN providers] can identify you much more precisely because you used your VPN login to access the service. Additionally, they can promise not to siphon off your data and write it down somewhere--tracking you, selling it to advertisers, handing it over to law enforcement--but they could and you'd be none the wiser."

Anyone thinking of using a VPN should read his entire piece, and Dennis Schubert's [VPN - a Very Precarious Narrative](https://schub.io/blog/2019/04/08/very-precarious-narrative.html) as well. I link to both of them in an upcoming article on basic computer security.
