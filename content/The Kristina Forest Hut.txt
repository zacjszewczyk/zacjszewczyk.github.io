Seeing pictures like this one remind me of all the times I looked at a hill and thought about how awesome it would be to grab a shovel and dig a house out of it, similar to the way Sean Hellfritsch and Rob Wilson built their [subterranean breakfast nook](http://cabinporn.com/post/46387925207/our-friends-sean-hellfritsch-and-rob-wilson-made), but more like [this stone cellar](http://cabinporn.com/post/50012211418/stone-cellar-in-elliston-newfoundland) in Newfoundland.
