I like Elliott Cost's idea, a lot: 

> "A feed is based around time, usually sorted reverse chronologically, whereas an explore page reveals the expansiveness of a website by pulling from disparate sources, indifferent to time, allowing one to jump into the depths of something entirely new."

Look for a new Explore page here over the next few weeks. What a great idea.
