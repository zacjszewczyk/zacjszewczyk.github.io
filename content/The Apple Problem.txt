> "Of course, most of these challenges are going to also impact Apple's competitors in the higher-end device space--they aren't unique to Apple. Plus, Apple has proven over and over again that they're able to innovate in way that its competitors can only dream about. So, don't get me wrong, I'm not worried about Apple's long-term fate in the least. However, that doesn't mean we won't see a bumpy road over the next few quarters and that's an Apple problem that has to be given serious thought."

Bob O'Donnell writing for Tech.pinions with an excellent article published in the wake of Apple's recent quarterly earnings call. Unlike most of the commentary I have done my best to avoid thus far, Bob takes a refreshingly even-handed approach to the topic. The coming year will indeed be an interesting one for Apple and the entire mobile computing industry alike.
