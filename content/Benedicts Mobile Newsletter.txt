Every Sunday Benedict Evans, whose articles I have linked to [numerous](Benedict Evans on Simplicity.txt) [times](Benedict Evans on Amazon's Profits.txt) in the past, publishes an excellent newsletter providing insightful observations into the tech and mobile industries' news to a subscriber base growing at an impressive rate of [1,000 every month](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/statuses/399534830842437633). Every week I look forward to the next installment of this thought-provoking newsletter, and Benedict always exceeds my expectations. If you need more convincing than my own personal endorsement of this invaluable resource though, take not just my word for it but a thousand others as well.
