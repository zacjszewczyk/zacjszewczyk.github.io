After coming across [another](Superman with a GoPro.txt) video on Laughing Squid of [a dad using a quadracopter to pull his son's tooth out](http://laughingsquid.com/father-pulls-out-his-sons-loose-baby-tooth-using-a-dji-phantom-quadcopter/), I found what has to be one of the coolest videos I have ever seen: Shaun O'Callaghan flew his own DJI Phantom quadcopter over an active volcano on Tanna Island, Vanuatu, and the resulting video is *awesome*.
