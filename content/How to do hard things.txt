I am immediately skeptical of any framework for getting something done. Individuals often use these elaborate processes to procrastinate, and in organizations they have a tendency to become bloated risk avoidance mechanisms. I see the former danger in [David Maciver's strategy for doing hard things](https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/), but it did remind me of my own, so I want to take a minute to share my approach here.

In short, just do the hard thing. When you don't feel like working out, [go](https://youtu.be/N3t-em026ec) [anyway](https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/1023918579522002944). When you don't feel like writing, write anyway. The more [something scares you](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19958340), the more important it is that you get aggressive, charge into it, and crush that thing until it holds no power over you. You might need a twelve step process to conquer that hard thing, but [just like in weightlifting](My Road to Weightlifting.txt), give hard work a try first.
