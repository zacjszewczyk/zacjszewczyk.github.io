"SplinterNet is a simple mobile app that allows users to author posts in a similar fashion to blogging or tweeting. These posts can contain text and a single image. However, rather than being hosting on internet servers, users distribute their posts by syncing with other app users via Bluetooth. The peer-to-peer syncing creates an ad hoc distribution network without requiring the use of mobile networks or any other monitored network infrastructure."

A very interesting idea indeed, even when considered as simply another form of blogging--a new platform for microblogging, perhaps. I look forward to hearing more from this app's creators as it evolves from development into a service suitable for widespread use.
