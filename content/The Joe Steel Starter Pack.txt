As detailed in [*The Curse of Preconceived Notions*](), before Monday night I had not read any of Joe Rosensteel's work; instead, I had wrongly disregarded it in any capacity surpassing that of humorous entertainment. When I finally came to my senses and started reading his blog though, starting with [*The Ubiquitous Yak for the Discerning Obsessive*](http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/73795711747/the-ubiquitous-yak-for-the-discerning-obsessive), I found that I really enjoy his thoughts and opinions. So for anyone else that, like me, made a similar mistake, I thought I would compile a short list of my favorite articles from Joe, to give you somewhere to start.

1. [Terrible Podcast Screenplays](http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/69711107323/terrible-podcast-screenplays). Given my need to see things through from beginning to end--I have never started a podcast from any point except episode one, and always start each new TV show with its first episode--I would be remiss if I did not point you here, where things began, at Joe Rosensteel's claim to fame.
2. [Yet Another End of the Year](http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/71732231987/yet-another-end-of-the-year). Like many of us, [myself included](Who to Follow in 2014.txt), Joe wrote "Yet-Another-End-of-the-Year blog post" to bring in the new year where he talked about 2012 and 2013 and zeroed in on a few intensely personal aspects of his life. In particular, I found his thoughts on using a job to define oneself especially interesting and cause for a bit of retrospection.
3. [Not my Cup of Coffee](http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/72843574172/not-my-cup-of-coffee). Ostensibly about coffee--because the internet *really* needed someone else talking about their fussy brewing methodology, Joe actually went on to talk about becoming okay with not pleasing everyone at every turn. For anyone considering writing publicly, I strongly recommend you read this first: it will save you a great deal of discomfort and indecision in the future. And for the record, I would have loved that pun.
4. [That Pointy Thing on Twitter](http://joe-steel.tumblr.com/post/73746142327/that-pointy-thing-on-twitter). I always find it interesting to see how another uses the same service I do, because we almost invariably employ it for different purposes. A conversation related to this one took place just over a week ago when [Clinton Phillips asked](https://twitter.com/clinton1550/status/421586419551727616) why someone would favorite and retweet the same tweet, and I responded by saying that I favorite tweets I want to earmark for later, and retweet ones I want my followers to see.

I have already subscribed to [Joe's site](http://joe-steel.tumblr.com), and after reading these articles, you should too.
