Joe Jackson has some good tips for better camp kitchens. I like to keep everything for cooking, eating, and cleaning in one container, packed at all times. I keep a second one empty for dry goods. This makes trip prep a breeze: I just load the first tote in my car, then fill up the second tote and my cooler in the grocery store's parking lot on my way out of town. Along with [two dining tables](http://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/furniture/tables/regular-dining-table), [two water jugs](https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B001QC31G6), and [my storage system](/projects.html#sleepingPlatform), this setup makes cooking tough meals easy, and eating them fun.
