I like these drawers from Land Shark Outfitters. With [big names in the space](https://www.goose-gear.com/collections/toyota-4runner-5th-gen-2010-present) pricing their systems at well over $1,000, I love the idea of a polished product at half the price. [My sleeping platform](/projects.html#sleepingPlatform) came out to about $600, with two sets of $215 [36" lock open/close slides](https://www.mcmaster.com/6603a55) and a $145 pair of [28" base mount slides](https://www.mcmaster.com/1102A71). Having gone through that build process, though, and after seeing this system from Land Shark Outfitters, I think I could cut it in half. My 4Runner may have a Jeep parked beside it within the next year or two, so we will find out soon.
