Fascinating short documentary done by Motherboard on Soylent. Since it came out I have been a somewhat vocal proponent of this product, but remained so only in theory: through this site I readily recommended others try Soylent every time I wrote about it, but never actually gave it a shot myself. After seeing this, though, I have finally decided to bite the bullet and order some: I'll start with the original Soylent, and then, depending on how that goes, maybe even dabble in creating my own over at [DIY.soylent.me](http://diy.soylent.me). Either way though, I'll let you know how it goes.
