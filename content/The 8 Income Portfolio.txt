The folks over at [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com), one of my new favorite websites, posted an interest writeup on a portfolio that has outperformed the market since October, 2014. Check out the original article [here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2589345-an-income-portfolio-high-income-and-capital-preservation). As I work to eliminate debt and build a nest egg, so that I can then invest and prepare for retirement [early](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/joy-and-pain/201504/the-best-time-plant-tree-was-20-years-ago-no-matter), this subject has become ever-more interesting to me. Seeking Alpha--clearly--has some great advice, from some smart people.
