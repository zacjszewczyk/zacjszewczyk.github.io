[Speaking of Kevin Kelly](100 True Fans.txt), he wrote an interesting article examining the Amish's relationship with technology.

> "They don't adopt everything new but what new technology they do embrace, they take up about half a century after everyone else does. By that time, the benefits and costs are clear, the technology stable, and it is cheap."

Now that just seems like good sense.
