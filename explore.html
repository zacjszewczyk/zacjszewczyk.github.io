<p>It&#8217;s taken me way too long, but I finally got some time to read the backlog of email newsletters in my inbox. Alongside <a href="https://secure.huckberry.com/users/sign_up">Huckberry&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://ben-evans.com/newsletter/">Benedict Evans&#8217; Mobile Newsletter</a>, today I read my first issue of The Backseat Companion&#160;&#8212;&#160;and let me tell you, I loved it. The Backseat Companion is everything a newsletter should be: interesting, informative, humorous&#160;&#8212;&#160;a joy to read, to be sure. If MailChimp isn&#8217;t your thing, you can also read <a href="https://medium.com/@backseatcomp">past issues on Medium</a>. Regardless of where you go though, you&#8217;ll have to head over to <a href="http://thebackseatcompanion.tumblr.com/">Gianfranco Lanzio and Diego Petrucci&#8217;s tumblr to subscribe</a>. Do yourself a favor and just head over there now though: you&#8217;ll be there soon enough anyways.</p>

<p>Chris Fox <a href="https://hackernoon.com/test-driven-development-is-fundamentally-wrong-hor3z4d">makes some good points</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With over 20 years experience at the time I recognized the first obvious flaw [with test-driven design]; writing tests prior to coding is mindful of the old adage about no battle plan surviving contact with the enemy. ... The second problem here is that TDD presumes that developers should write their own tests. This is supremely ridiculous. I’ve seen this many, many times; the project appears solid to me, I can&#8217;t break it, but someone else can break it in less than a minute. Why? Because the same blind spots that I had in design will appear in my tests.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Vester made some similar points in <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/i-am-not-thinking-about-unit-tests-right-now"><em>I Am Not Thinking About Unit Tests ... Right Now</em></a>. </p>

<p>I have avoided test-driven design for similar reasons. For <a href="/projects.html#codingProjects">my projects</a>, I like to start by defining performance goals; I write <a href="https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/negative-testing/">a few test cases</a> for each feature I finish <em>as I finish it</em>, then move on. This has all the benefits of test-driven design&#160;&#8212;&#160;defining requirements up-front, clear success criteria, objective verifiability throughout the development process and at its conclusion&#160;&#8212;&#160;without the downsides Chris highlights: wasted effort and lack of actual code coverage. </p>

<p>I cannot stress the importance of unit tests enough: when I wrote a socket web server in Python, they gave me an easy way to make sure each change did not unintentionally break a key performance objective I had already checked off. This saved me <em>hours</em> of periodic, manual, boring checks. I have no such affinity for test-driven design, and I would encourage you to reevaluate your loyalty if you do.</p>

<p>I just flew home after three months in Minnesota. The TSA agents at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul airport in Minnesota were <em>delightful</em>: the man at the end of the security line checking my ID and boarding pass joked with me as I went through; the agent on the other side of the body scanner couldn&#8217;t have been nicer. Then, as I was trying to find my gate on my boarding pass and undoubtedly looking quite confused, a TSA agent that happened to be walking by stopped and asked if I needed any help. She didn&#8217;t have to stop; she could have kept on walking, but she didn&#8217;t, and for that I was very grateful despite not needing her assistance.</p>
