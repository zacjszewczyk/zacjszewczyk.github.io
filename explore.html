<p>This is such a cool idea: Denis Shiryaev used Gigapixel AI&#8217;s neural network to upscale a classif video from 1896 into 4k; as Timothy Bee <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/someone-used-neural-networks-to-upscale-a-famous-1896-video-to-4k-quality/">points out</a>, a similar approach could then add color.  </p>

<p>One of my long-term projects involves making the small part of the internet I use every day available offline. As I <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">lean</a> toward a more nomadic lifestyle, I may not always have ready access to the familiar shows I stream on Netflix, for example, or that one news article from a few weeks ago. A single hard drive could store everything I have ever watched, read, and listened to, though, and so I want to make that happen. This goes well with one of my other long-term projects, which involves curating evergreen digital media for posterity&#8217;s sake. Think of the former as every movie I have ever watched, and the latter as the classics I want to save for my kids. There are many <a href="https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/which-compression-format-to-use-for-archiving/">subltle challenges</a> to this, but none so obvious as the fact that even video from a few years ago looks bad on modern displays. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/someone-used-neural-networks-to-upscale-a-famous-1896-video-to-4k-quality/">Denis&#8217;s demonstration</a> gives me hope that this may not always be the case.</p>

<p>After last month&#8217;s post, I feared for the future viability of this series as I continued an apparent trend of finding fewer and fewer cool links for each of these issues. After the last few weeks, however, I&#8217;m convinced that those slow months were flukes: this time around, boy have I got some great cabins to show you. Let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://tiny-project.com">The Tiny Project</a>, then, a small house built on a trailer that features beautiful architecture and well thought-out design. Very impressive&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would be more than happy to live in one of these, traveling around the country with the comfort of home just a few feet from my steering wheel. Maybe some day.</p>

<p>Despite it&#8217;s oxymoron of a title, this is a great piece by Felix Martin for Wired drawing some interesting parallels between Bitcoin and the monetary system of sixteenth-century Europe. Bitcoin has enjoyed a great deal of support up until now, but the jury is still out as to whether it will turn in to a viable, stable currency or go down in history as a somewhat lengthy flash in the pan. Hopefully, though, for the reasons Felix laid out in his conclusion, Bitcoin will.</p>
