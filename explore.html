<p>I haven&#8217;t read Jack Donovan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis">work</a> or <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/podcast-2/">listened</a> to <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-243-becoming-barbarian/">his</a> <a href="https://www.orderofman.com/a-more-complete-beast-jack-donovan/">podcasts</a> in a while, so I forgot how good some of his stuff is until I re-discovered <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2011/03/violence-is-golden/"><em>Violence is Golden</em></a> this morning. From his article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A rule not ultimately backed by the threat of violence is merely a suggestion. States rely on laws enforced by men ready to do violence against lawbreakers. Every tax, every code and every licensing requirement demands an escalating progression of penalties that, in the end, must result in the forcible seizure of property or imprisonment by armed men prepared to do violence in the event of resistance or non–compliance. ... Without action, words are just words. Without violence, laws are just words. Violence isn’t the only answer, but it is the final answer.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ours is a comfortable reality&#160;&#8212;&#160;but just barely.</p>

<p>The tendency to choose the path of least resistance has always been one of the most annoying personality traits I possess. Often manifested as a calm, easygoing attitude it has, however, served me quite well over the years. A double-edged sword if ever there was a more appropriate time to use the phrase, on the one hand the ability to discern and choose the course of action most agreeable to the largest number of dissidents has proven extremely useful; in combination with the easygoing attitude this approach prompts, I have been able to avoid unnecessary stress more times than I can remember, and for that I am thankful. On the other hand though, I often find myself backing down from an argument in favor of a different solution to the disagreement where in all actuality, a fight would have been the most appropriate response. That&#8217;s when the likeable, everyman attitude becomes problematic: when it becomes the driving force behind the tendency to not fight for the things you believe in, whether those &#8220;things&#8221; are something so simple as the place for dinner or something possibly infinitely more complex such as an opinion. As writers on the internet who are exposed to criticism of the latter much more often than the former of the two, it&#8217;s important to stick to your guns, to not balk in the face of adversity; for on the internet ambivalence is perceived as weakness, and just as in nature, weakness will be brutally stamped out.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to The Next Web during the plagiarism fiasco from a few months back, which I wrote about in my post from quite a while ago titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/bullies.html"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>. In that article, I briefly conveyed the lasting impression the whole affair left on my mind regarding The Next Web: &#8220;I have associated The Next Web with plagiarism, rash outbursts, and poor choices.&#8221; As I said in that article, to this day I refuse to read articles on The Next Web.</p>
