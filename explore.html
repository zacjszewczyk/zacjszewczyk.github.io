<p>&#8220;Siri can get confused, of course, as every iPhone owner knows. For example, searching for the Pokmon &#8216;Charmander&#8217; kept autocorrecting to Mander. But this can be excused. It&#8217;s a freaking Pokdex. In your pocket. Just think about how your 10-year-old self would feel about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like Shawn Blanc, I too prefer to share interesting links I come across on my site rather than through Twitter or, dare I even say it, Facebook.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Like Lopp and Bowler, many people are migrating to Twitter as their outlet to share links. And while I think Twitter and App.net are great places for that, I personally like the idea of sharing most of the links I come across via my site.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I choose to link a post based on three criteria: my interest in the topic, whether I feel I can add to the conversation or not, and depending on the obscurity of the link. I don&#8217;t link to an article or a product if I&#8217;m not excited about it; I don&#8217;t want to waste my readers&#8217; time any more than I want to waste mine. If I can&#8217;t add to the conversation in a significant way, I simply won&#8217;t join it. There are already too many websites that do this. And for those gems hidden on the fiftieth page of Cabin Porn or buried at the end of a long article, I often link to those as a way to call attention to something excellent that otherwise might go unnoticed. That&#8217;s how I link, relying on the quality of my commentary and prudence in determining whether to link to an article or not to separate my site from the myriad others that have adopted the linkblog format. That&#8217;s how I define rather than copy.</p>

<p>Yes, the title is maybe a little too sensational for my liking; yes, &#8220;Financial Samurai&#8221; is a bit ostentatious. But you know what? Sam Dogen is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers for his terrific financial insight, and that more than makes up for any choice I may disagree with with regards to his approach to writing on the internet. Of all the sites I subscribe to and all the writers I follow, he is the only writer whose work I read regardless of topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s just that good. What&#8217;s more, most of his work&#160;&#8212;&#160;in addition to providing helpful advice I have already gone on to implement as a step towards securing my financial future&#160;&#8212;&#160;can be translated and applied to the career I wish to some day have writing here. His latest article, linked above, is a great example of this valuable combination of practical advice for furthering you both in your career and your life as well, and thus something I strongly recommend you check out; and if you like it, go through his back catalog: each article is just as applicable today as it was when he first published it.</p>
