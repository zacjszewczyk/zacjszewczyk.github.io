<time id='article_time' datetime="2013-05-11 11:25:51-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-05.html">05</a>/11 11:25:51 EST in <a href='/tech.html'>Tech</a></time>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps more noteworthy is Reeder&#8217;s new, standalone RSS feature &#160;&#8212;&#160; you don&#8217;t even need a Feedbin or Google Reader account anymore. Instead, you can start curating RSS feeds right on your iPhone; if you had a Google Reader account you can also simply import your feeds straight from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Great news. Reeder is easily my favorite iOS RSS reader, and definitely one of the best on the market. This new feature makes it all the more appealing not just to me as an existing customer, but hopefully to potential future users as well. I just imported all my Google Reader feeds in to the app, and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>The folks over at <a href="https://seekingalpha.com">Seeking Alpha</a>, one of my new favorite websites, posted an interest writeup on a portfolio that has outperformed the market since October, 2014. Check out the original article <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2589345-an-income-portfolio-high-income-and-capital-preservation">here</a>. As I work to eliminate debt and build a nest egg, so that I can then invest and prepare for retirement <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/joy-and-pain/201504/the-best-time-plant-tree-was-20-years-ago-no-matter">early</a>, this subject has become ever-more interesting to me. Seeking Alpha&#160;&#8212;&#160;clearly&#160;&#8212;&#160;has some great advice, from some smart people.</p>

<p>As Marco said in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/01/01/anandtech-2013-mac-pro-review">his post</a> linking to AnandTech&#8217;s new Mac Pro evaluation, &#8220;For Mac OS reviews, read John Siracusa. For Mac reviews, read Anand.&#8221; This has become widely accepted over the last few years, and rightly so: these two writers epitomize every aspect of excellence within their respective fields. That&#8217;s why I sat down with AnandTech&#8217;s latest article, despite having no intention of buying a Mac Pro within the foreseeable future. After Marco&#8217;s recommendation I originally intended to focus solely on page two, but before I knew it Anand had sucked me in and I ended up finishing the entire piece.</p>

<p>During <a href="http://neutral.fm">Neutral&#8217;s</a> brief run John made an interesting point in their discussion of the latest Ferrari supercar which, I believe, took place during <a href="http://neutral.fm/episodes/8-three-james-mays">episode eight</a>: car companies traditionally focused on mid-range to low-end price points nevertheless devote significant time and money to building incredibly powerful vehicles&#160;&#8212;&#160;some of which never even make it to market&#160;&#8212;&#160;in order to push the boundaries of the automotive industry and showcase the extremes of their abilities as engineers, designers, and manufacturers. In the computing world, Apple&#8217;s Mac Pro fulfills a similar role in epitomizing the juxtaposition of power, usability, and design. To shift focus briefly back to cars, high-end car companies like BMW and Audi charge a premium for craftsmanship and luxury, yes, but also for the latest vehicular technology available that more economical cars will not see for years to come. To predict the future of the low end, one need only look to the current high end: within a few generations that technology will trickle down to the economy classes, replaced with even more impressive features, and so the cycle will repeat itself. We may draw another parallel to the Mac Pro here as the signifier of impending change to not only Apple&#8217;s other computing devices over the next few years, but the computing industry as a whole resultant of Apple&#8217;s relatively new position as today&#8217;s most popular tech company. Therein lies my reasoning behind setting aside an hour or so to read Anand&#8217;s article and put this short post together: while I do not plan on buying a Mac Pro, it serves as an excellent indicator of where the high end is headed, and thus sets a reasonable expectation for the next few years with regards to not only CPU performance, but every other aspect as well.</p>
