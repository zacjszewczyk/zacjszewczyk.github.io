<p>Marco Arment gave Jacob Goldstein of NPR some concrete numbers for the Magazine, showing just how great an idea launching this publication was, the importance of a consistent publication schedule, and the rewards of such an excellent implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Last fall, Marco Arment launched a general interest magazine. It&#8217;s called, aptly enough, The Magazine. Writers are paid $800 per article. There are no ads. Until recently, it was available only via iPhones and iPads. Astonishingly, it&#8217;s already turning a profit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier today I stumbled across an interesting article called <a href="http://stupidiswinning.tumblr.com/post/40268049719/we-are-in-the-final-years-of-our-internet">We Are In The Final Years of Our Internet</a> over on Stupid Is Winning explaining why the author believes the internet as we know it is likely to gradually fade as a younger, more tech savvy generation comes of age. The author is hypothesizing that a generation raised on touch screens and iTunes is unlikely to use the internet in the same way it is used now, which will eventually bring about a revolution of sorts in which the computing world and the internet in particular centers around specific apps rather than the browser. Perhaps the most interesting part in the article is not the main body, however, but the &#8220;jumbled thoughts in no order&#8221; at the bottom of the post, where the author proposes a number of questions and scenarios. Rather than a certainty though&#160;&#8212;&#160;the idea that the world of technology and the internet in particular are destined to change dramatically in the near future&#160;&#8212;&#160;I think we need to ask ourselves these questions: what is the possibility of reaching an asymptote in the near future at which point the need for innovation ceases? Before you answer, consider another: does anyone really want a phone the size of a bluetooth dongle&#160;&#8212;&#160;a Siri phone? does anymore <em>really</em> want a computer inside their head? Perhaps ranging into the dystopian extreme with the latter scenario, the thought nevertheless begs the question, &#8220;Is there a point at which we will have innovated <em>enough</em> that further innovation and future disruption is not only unwanted but also&#160;&#8212;&#160;and most importantly&#160;&#8212;&#160;unwarranted?&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier this month Linus Edwards wrote an article he titled <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/4/16/numbers">Numbers</a>, a piece where he posited that metrics-based social networks such as Twitter have made interpersonal interaction a game in which attracting the most attention means winning, and have simultaneously chipped away at the majority&#8217;s ability to maintain real relationships devoid of such concrete numbers and superficial endorsements in the form of likes, favorites, retweets, etcetera. In response to his essay, I countered by questioning the existence of this purportedly unfortunate shift in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/killing-twitter.html">Killing Twitter</a>, and an <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/461122192361926656">interesting conversation</a> ensued. Ultimately, in evaluating the validity of Linus&#8217;s proposed network devoid of all but the most basic of social mechanics, it came down a question of the aspects leading to such a service&#8217;s success. Unsurprisingly, that effectively ended the conversation; but it also got me thinking.</p>
