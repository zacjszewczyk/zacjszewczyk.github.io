<p>An interesting article from Tyler Cowen that gained considerable popularity on Hacker News a few days ago, for very good reason: although a difficult read at times, his article makes a strong case for Bitcoin&#8217;s inevitable decline. Also worth reading, Tyler linked to <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/04/dan-kervick-bitcoins-deflationary-weirdness.html">an article by Dan Kervick</a> in a similar vein to this one along with another of his own from November, <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/11/china-and-the-soaring-price-of-bitcoin.html"><em>China, and the soaring price of Bitcoin</em></a>, both worth checking out.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen a great proliferation of linkblogs, by far and away the most popular topic of which is technology and, specifically, Apple. Nevertheless the likes of John Gruber&#160;&#8212;&#160;who did not, despite many erroneous beliefs, invent either the format or topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Shawn Blanc have made their mark as entrants to a space established long before their arrival. This not only happens in the blogging space, but the podcasting industry as well where interview shows like Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s <em>Bitsplitting</em> came in and <em>sherlocked</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;ugh&#160;&#8212;&#160;the existing space, which already had <em>plenty</em> of interview programs, with a really great show.</p>

<time id='article_time' datetime="2013-02-04 13:17:17-0400" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="/blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="/blog/2013-02.html">02</a>/04 13:17:17 EST in <a href='/writing.html'>Writing</a></time>
<p>In the wee hours of this morning Andrew Sullivan and his team completed The Dish&#8217;s migration from The Daily Beast, transitioning fully to a reader-supported model. In an article posted to The Verge a few hours later titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/4/3949834/andrew-sullivan-the-dish-experiment-goes-live"><em>Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s grand experiment in reader-supported online journalism is now live</em></a>, Jeff Blagdon describes the challenges facing The Dish as one of the first major websites to become reader-supported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Prominent political blogger Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s site The Dish is now up and running at its new user-funded home. So far, the ad-free experiment appears to be a success, with Sullivan pulling in $511,000 in revenue over the five weeks that passed since the project was announced &#160;&#8212;&#160; half of the $1 million the writer says he needs to run the site for a year.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeff went on to question the plausibility of The Dish reaching its funding goal in the coming weeks, skeptical of whether or not it was possible. But Andrew has a plan, detailed in The Verge&#8217;s piece <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/2/3827960/andrew-sullivan-dish-blog-leaving-daily-beast-for-reader-subscription-model"><em>Andrew Sullivan leaving The Daily Beast for ad-free, reader-supported blog</em></a> as well as on The Dish&#8217;s own site in <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/02/04/migration-explained/"><em>Migration Explained</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Starting Monday morning, some posts will have a blue &#8216;Read On&#8217; button. If you click that button, the post will expand for continued reading, just as in the past. If you&#8217;re a subscriber, you will always be able to access all read-on material. If you are a non-subscriber, you will be limited to seven read-on clicks during a 30-day period. If you open a read-on post in a new window, that will also count against the read-on meter. If non-subscribers max out the read-on meter, all content above a read-on will still be free and accessible - but the deeper dish won&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Striking the delicate balance between a full-on paywall and leaving their content open for anyone to read, The Dish&#8217;s segregation strategy fills me with hope for other major websites forsaking ads in place of reader contributions in one form or another. He continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Incoming links from other blogs and websites will never, ever count toward the meter; other bloggers need not fear that their readers won&#8217;t be able to see content they link to. I want to personally soothe Dan Savage&#8217;s concern on this point.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I foresee this becoming a problem, I applaud The Dish&#8217;s foresight to create their paywall strategy with bloggers in mind. All in all The Dish has a very interesting plan, one that I hope to see succeed in the coming months.</p>
