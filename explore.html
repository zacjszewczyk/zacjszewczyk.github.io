<p>I realize in my last two articles, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/instapaper-5.html"><em>Instapaper 5</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in which I made a number of proposals for Instapaper 5&#160;&#8212;&#160;and <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/betaworks-releases-instapaper-5.html"><em>Betaworks Releases Instapaper 5</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in which I conveyed my mostly positive feelings on the new release&#160;&#8212;&#160;I likely appeared very critical of Betaworks and their continued work on Instapaper. This is not the case: while I do feel a better launch strategy entailing a service-wide design overhaul and one in which they added a larger set of new features to Instapaper would have greatly helped the platform, I am not of the opinion that Betaworks did not improve the app in Instapaper 5; the impressive new InstaRank feature is a prime example of this.</p>

<p>That said though, I cannot help but feel that this feature, too, would have benefited from some additional development time. I may&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the blog post linked earlier confirms this suspicion&#160;&#8212;&#160;be an outlier in that I prefer to keep my Instapaper queue small, in the four to eight article range, and read in chronological order. This is a roundabout way to say that I will find little use in Instapaper&#8217;s new Popularity sorting algorithm, but not that I could not at some point in the future: a section similar to The Feature&#160;&#8212;&#160;available under &#8220;Browse&#8221; on the iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;populated with articles ranked using the InstaRank algorithm through which I could find and save articles to my queue for consumption at a later date would be very useful indeed.</p>

<p>In a Merlin Mann, Inbox Zero-esq fashion, I do my best to carefully limit the number of things allowed to compete for my attention. Although I regularly fall far short of this goal in most areas of my life, I do a relatively good job when it comes to the news I read and the writers I follow on the internet. While one could certainly make the argument against Hacker News as a news source with any rhyme or reason, that single exception aside the rest of the content I consume on a daily basis comes to me through a carefully curated RSS stream. Outside of Hacker News and those RSS feeds primarily aggregating the content of one-man-shop bloggers, I do not follow any other news outlets. I do not follow CNN, Fox, Time, or The Washington Post. I don&#8217;t read the local newspaper, the national one, or any other print publication I could reliably hide behind. I don&#8217;t watch the news whenever I can help it; after sitting through a feature on the egregious and all-too-common problem of using too much laundry detergent, I see little point in taking the effort to turn the TV on and change the channel. I don&#8217;t even turn the radio on anymore. And while this approach certainly has some advantages&#160;&#8212;&#160;every day I am presented with a relatively low number of articles and news stories, fewer of the articles I encounter are poorly written and uninteresting, and as a result of those two benefits I rarely experience a shortage of good reading material&#160;&#8212;&#160;it has its fair share of disadvantages as well.</p>

<p>Not long after I found an old piece on attribution <a href="https://blog.thinkst.com/2013/02/thinkstscapes-2013-ah1-on-china-report.html">from Thinkst Applied Research</a>, Cisco&#8217;s Talos Intelligence group posted <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/08/attribution-puzzle.html">an article on the same topic</a>. Attribution is fraught, as both pieces explain. IP geolocation is woefully inaccurate, many of the tactics, techniques, and procedures tied to specific actors are either so common that they apply to several groups or so general that they might as well, and the proliferation of viable tool sets has made even this metric unreliable. At best, we can attribute activity with a degree of certainty&#160;&#8212;&#160;but never complete confidence, and you should be circumspect of anyone who does.</p>
