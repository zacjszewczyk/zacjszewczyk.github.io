<p>Steph Smith, on what it takes to become great. Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what greatness truly means. <em>I&#8217;ve come to learn that it&#8217;s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</em>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot agree more. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">As I said before about weightlifting</a>, &#8220;Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible. Before worrying about anything else, worry about doing that; that is the single most effective way to reach your goals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not try to explain away others&#8217; successes, or try to excuse your own failures, by calling them anything other than the results of long, hard work&#160;&#8212;&#160;or a lack thereof. Anything else would be a lie, to yourself and anyone else to which you justify your actions.</p>

<p>This post&#8217;s title comes from <a href="https://youtu.be/PurwB5H3F0o">Ray Lewis</a>. I love that line, and I encourage you to take it to heart. I did many years ago, and it has served me well.</p>

<p>If you have never tried cooking with cast iron, you and everyone that has ever eaten with you are missing out: with the exception of boiling water, every single dish you can think of cooked with a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven turns out better than when made with a utensil of inferior materials, and everything is inferior to cast iron when it comes to cooking. Forget stainless steel, non-stick, and everything else: nothing holds a candle to this material. That&#8217;s why I, personally, cook everything in a cast iron pan, and wouldn&#8217;t even think of using anything else. So do yourself a favor and pick one of these up; I promise, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

<p>Jeff Kish is a contributing editor for <a href="http://gearjunkie.com/">Gear Junkie</a>, a great site that publishes articles about the outdoors and the gear we humans can use to best tackle it. For the past two months, Jeff has been on a mission to hike the Pacific Northwest Trail, and post regular updates and gear reviews along the way. With this report, he has finally crossed the halfway point, and so I felt that now was as good a time as any to post a link here: if you, like me, appreciate a good trail almost as much as a great work of prose, I encourage you to give <a href="http://gearjunkie.com/PNT">this series</a> a look: it has both in good supply.</p>
