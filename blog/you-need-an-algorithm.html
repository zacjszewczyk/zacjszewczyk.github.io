<p>A few weeks ago, I participated in a working group tasked with identifying areas where artificial intelligence and machine learning could improve network utilization. What, specifically, &#8220;improve&#8221; and &#8220;utilization&#8221; meant were some of the first questions we addressed. During that conversation, though, one of the participants made an insightful observation that the group promptly ignored. He told a brief story about how someone had asked him for a networking device that could aggregate multiple uplinks and then &#8220;use AI to choose the best one.&#8221; When he offered a simple WAN failover solution, a technology that has existed for decades and comes built-in to open source firewalls like pfSense, commercial appliances from the likes of Cisco, and every modern mobile phone, the customer told him, &#8220;No.&#8221; Like our working group, that customer person had a solution (artificial intelligence) driving their requirements (an AI-based WAN failover), not the other way around.</p>

<p>The question my working group grappled with was not, &#8220;How can we improve X?&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;a question that presumes X needed improving, which in our case it did not&#160;&#8212;&#160;but rather, &#8220;How can AI and ML do the improving?&#8221; As the world continues to <a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/laplaces-demon-and-the-black-box-of-artificial-intelligence/">wring its hands</a> about &#8220;explainable&#8221; and &#8220;transparent&#8221; AI, it&#8217;s worth considering the possibility that in many cases&#160;&#8212;&#160;like in the WAN failover scenario&#160;&#8212;&#160;the solution might be driving the requirements; in many cases, what we actually need is something much less complex, something that looks a lot less like AI and a lot more like a basic algorithm.</p>
