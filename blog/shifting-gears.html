<p>When I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/writers-guilt.html"><em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em></a> a few hours ago, I was done. I was drained. I was finished, and I was mad. Nevertheless, for an article written in anger, it turned out to be pretty good. As I walked downstairs after publishing it, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel just a little proud. Then I had a banana, an orange, sat down on the couch, and watched The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift for the first time in much too long. I had forgotten how great a movie it is&#160;&#8212;&#160;I had forgotten how great the entire series is, really. But after Tokyo Drift ended, as the last scene faded from the screen and the credits began to roll, I remembered. I remembered how much I love the series; I remembered how much I love movies.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s Moises rubbing off on me, but as I was sitting on the couch with a cool, post-storm breeze coming in through the window behind me, listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/42">episode forty-two of CMD+SPACE</a>, I found the something I had been searching for while writing <em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em>.</p>

<p>At its inception, <em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em> began as an explanation of how I had yet to find my voice in writing. I wanted to put to words my realization that the tech topics I had covered up to this point&#160;&#8212;&#160;while interesting to me, yes&#160;&#8212;&#160;did not inspire me, and that inspiration was what I needed to do the one thing that constantly frustrates me: write regularly. Alas, the article instead turned in to a &#8220;forget you, I&#8217;ll do what I want&#8221; sort of piece. I was missing my voice, after all, and I couldn&#8217;t write without it.</p>

<p>With a cool breeze blowing in behind me, I found my voice in the credits of Tokyo Drift. Technology has always fascinated me; it will forever remain a passion of mine and something that I will undoubtedly continue to write about. Even more than technology though, I love movies and TV shows. That&#8217;s a topic I can write about, and maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;a topic I can write about every day.</p>
