<p>In a draft titled <em>Starting Over</em>, I try to condense a decade&#8217;s worth of outdoor gear experience. The 8,000 word missive, started in 2017, highlights &#8220;The Gear I Would Buy if I Had to Do it All Over Again&#8221;. After thousands of dollars spent searching for the best of the best, it tries help those just starting out avoid some of the expensive lessons I had to learn. That post has not left my drafts folder, though, in part because the list keeps changing. Two weeks in Arizona made me reconsider my chosen boot, the <a href="https://www.vasque.com/mens-hiking-footwear/mens-hiking-boots/st.-elias-fg-gtx-07146.html">Vasque St. Elias GTX</a>, plus I need to try the new <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/equipment-auxiliary-suggested-picks/phantom-50-nf0a3bxv">Phantom 50</a> I bought while there to go with my <a href="https://matadorup.com/products/freerain24-2-0">Matador Freerain 24</a>. I want to move to a more lightweight and season-agnostic setup, and I will have to see how that plays out before I publish the be-all, end-all list for aspiring adventurers. Until then, take a look at these sites. I do a lot of research before I buy, and that research starts here.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/">https://thewirecutter.com/</a></strong> - The Wirecutter reviews product categories, and recommends a few of the best in each. Look here for reviews of consumer products, rather than outdoor gear in particular, but you may find some good information about the latter, too.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/">http://toolsandtoys.net/</a></strong> - Tools &#38; Toys reviews focus on products rather than entire categories, so expect less breadth than a site like The Wirecutter. These writers bring a different, less utilitarian, and more bespoke perspective to the table, which I sometimes find valuable.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/">https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/</a></strong> - Outdoor Gear Lab&#8217;s tagline says it all: its staff write &#8220;the world&#8217;s most in-depth and scientific reviews of outdoor gear&#8221;, period. Enough said.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.rtings.com/">https://www.rtings.com/</a></strong> - RTINGS focuses on electronics like keyboards, televisions, and headphones. The site&#8217;s approach strikes me as a cross between The Wirecutter&#8217;s and Outdoor Gear Lab&#8217;s, which makes RTINGS a great resource for those shopping for peripherals. </li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/">https://www.tomshardware.com/</a></strong> - Tom&#8217;s Hardware reviews computers and computer components. I referred to these reviews quite a bit when building my own computer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/">https://www.anandtech.com/</a></strong> - AnandTech reviews computer components more than entire computers, but the website contains both. I also made heavy use of this website when building my computer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thinkprivacy.io/">https://www.thinkprivacy.io/</a></strong> - ThinkPrivacy recommends applications and services based on how well they preserve their users&#8217; privacy. This has become increasingly important to me, so I try to choose from these lists as much as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do a lot of research before I buy, because I like to buy one good thing once&#160;&#8212;&#160;instead of three bad things before shelling out for the good thing I should have bought in the first place. That research starts with these websites, <em>but does not end there</em>. They all thoroughly test many similar items, evaluate them, and recommend the best one for most people. My strange and opaque criteria may overlap with the reviewers&#8217;, but seldom matches it, so I take as much as I can from each and then keep hunting. Until I get around to posting <em>Starting Over</em>, I suggest you do the same&#160;&#8212;&#160;and even then, take my advice with a grain of salt. <em>Starting Over</em> should add to this list, not replace it.</p>
