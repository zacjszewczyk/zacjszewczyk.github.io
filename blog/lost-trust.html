<p>Every time I save an article to Instapaper I immediately open the app to make sure it actually went there. Although quite some time has passed since this proved a worthwhile exercise, my unfortunate habit stems from a fear derived of Instapaper&#8217;s past inability to parse <a href="http://freecabinporn.com">Cabin Porn</a> URLs. Because I once had faith in the system I happily sent every post I planned to write about over to Instapaper, intending to come back to those articles at a later date. However, this practice came back to bite me when Instapaper failed to accurately record the correct article URLs, much less successfully parse their contents, and I lost several weeks&#8217; worth of effort spent in aggregation. I seem to remember something similar happening with other sites around this time, but Cabin Porn is the sole site that Instapaper consistently failed to handle appropriately.</p>

<p>Instapaper has gotten a lot better server-side lately, with faster, more reliable syncing and fewer errors in parsing content, but in the end these improvements are all for naught because the original, rock-solid trust I once had in the app is gone. Trust once had and then lost is much more difficult to regain than gaining one&#8217;s trust at the onset. Something to keep in mind when developing anything that touches personal data.</p>
