        <meta name="description" content="A few days ago Stefan Constantinescu of [Tab Dump](http://tabdump.com/) wrote an article titled [*Making Some Bets*](http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/1/22/making-some-bets), where he announced his decision to go fully independent and rely on his writing to support himself.

The broad range of topics he covers makes for very interesting reading and highlights great articles I would never have found otherwise, but I could get that from any old news reader. Rather, it is the unique format and accompanying succinct summarizations that I find so compelling about Stefan's new daily venture, and it doesn't hurt that he includes enough articles to keep me set for a day or two, at least, with each installment. I really like this new thing Stefan decided to do, and I think you will too. Definitely go check it out.">
