<p>My book <em>Handbook for Defensive Cyberspace Operations</em> contains an extensive chapter on tools and resources for cybersecurity analysts. As a closed project, however, this knowledge has had little impact outside of my niche community. This post contains a version of that chapter suitable for distribution to the public.</p>

<p>This post focuses on tools and resources for use by cybersecurity analysts leading up to, or during, an investigation. It does not contain introductory resources for topics like computer science, IT, cybersecurity, math, data science, data analysis, formal analytic methodologies, or structured analytic techniques. Those are beyond the scope of this post. While this post does contain some sources for cyber threat intelligence, see also <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/threat-intel-and-threat-research.html"><em>Threat Intelligence &#38; Threat Research</em></a> for more.</p>

<p>This post is broken into two main sections. The first, threat intelligence, is further broken down into sources for industry threat intelligence, threat intelligence feeds, tools for indicator research, sources for threat actor information, sources for vulnerability information, and rule repositories. The second section, reference material, lists sources for helpful contextual information, scheduled reporting on the cyber threat landscape, and sources for quality technical white papers.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ThreatIntelligence">Threat Intelligence<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ThreatIntelligence">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Analysts often struggle to obtain timely, accurate, relevant, predictive, and tailored intelligence about the enemy and other aspects of the operational environment. This list highlights tools, platforms, and resources for threat intelligence feeds, indicator research, threat actor information, SIEM rules, and more. For more sources of finished and raw intelligence, check out the blog post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/threat-intel-and-threat-research.html"><em>Threat Intelligence &#38; Threat Research</em></a>.</p>

<p>Many struggle to act on intelligence insights, especially at the rate these sources produce products and in the cyber domain in general. While this task may seem daunting, MENASEC&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.menasec.net/2020/11/how-to-design-detection-logic-part-1.html"><em>How to Design Detection Logic</em></a> series presents an approachable six step process for writing rules to detect malicious activity. Host, Network, and Intelligence analysts must collaborate to make this effective.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="IndustryThreatIntelligence">Industry Threat Intelligence<span>&nbsp;<a href="#IndustryThreatIntelligence">#</a></span></h4>

<p>This section lists industry threat intelligence platforms available either publicly or via subscription. Some blow off sources like these, but they are important components of a robust hunting program. Network defenders have have both nation-state and non-nation-state adversaries to contend with; even state-sponsored groups, though, often repurpose common intrusions sets to mask their activity. Some organization tends to zero in on zero day exploits, and focus on tailor-made intrusion sets, but when adversaries can get in with harvested credentials via remote management services, or by using public exploits on unpatched forward-facing servers, there&#8217;s just no need to go to such extremes.</p>

<p>Public threat intelligence from civilian organizations is also valuable because it gives incident responders something non-proprietary to share with local defenders.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/">https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/</a> - A threat intelligence platform that provides reports, exportable indicators, and indicator search functionality.</li>
<li><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/">https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/</a> - Another threat intelligence platform that provides reports, exportable indicators, and indicator search functionality. Recorded Future&#8217;s reports are especially valuable for current information on APT activity and infrastructure. This platform also makes it easy to create alerts for any mention of blue infrastructure or entities on underground hacking forums and other Dark Web locations.</li>
<li><a href="https://intelligence.fireeye.com/">https://intelligence.fireeye.com/</a> - A third threat intelligence platform, FireEye provides reports, exportable indicators, and indicator search functionality. Like Recorded Future, FireEye also does a good job tracking nation-state APTs.</li>
<li><a href="https://otx.alienvault.com">https://otx.alienvault.com</a> - AT&T&#8217;s Open Threat Exchange is a free, crowd sourced threat intelligence platform. It has all the same features paid alternatives offer, and while you should take some of its data with a grain of salt, it sometimes has even better information. These low-confidence associations may be just what you need to fill in the missing link.</li>
<li><a href="https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/">https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/</a> - While not a company like the other entries in this list, Intrusion Truth publishes threat research based on open-source collection, with a particular focus on the persona aspect of Chinese threat actors. </li>
</ul>

<p>For more sources of cyber threat intelligence, check out the blog post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/threat-intel-and-threat-research.html"><em>Threat Intelligence &#38; Threat Research</em></a>. That document lists several public sources of threat intelligence from organizations, individuals, and social media sources. Leaders should use information like this to inform their operations, and analysts can integrate it into their hunts.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="ThreatIntelligenceFeeds">Threat Intelligence Feeds<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ThreatIntelligenceFeeds">#</a></span></h4>

<p>This section lists several public and private threat intelligence feeds. As part of their threat actor analysis, researchers have also built extensive lists of indicators of compromise. Collect these lists in preparation to configure the defenders&#8216; SIEM to automatically flag matches in host events and network traffic. Automating the detection of known bad is not only an important step in finding evidence of malicious activity, but also an important step to free up analysts to hunt for &#8220;unknown bad&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;that is, malicious activity that has not yet been identified. The analysts&#8217; value in the cyber domain lies in their ability to apply domain knowledge and critical thinking to discover an adversary that has taken great care to operate undetected, not searching for simple indicator matches.</p>

<p>While many deride these lists for producing too much noise and lacking the context necessary to drive actual decisions, they do have a place in a mature threat hunting program. If everyone knows a server or file hash is malicious, I want to know, too. If nothing else, it gives my analysts a sound basis for an investigation that may uncover other, unrelated malicious activity. Indicator overwhelm is a real challenge, though: as The Ponemon Institute&#8217;s <em>The State of Threat Feed Effectiveness in the United States and United Kingdom</em> found, volume is one of the most common barriers to deriving value from threat feeds. Mathew Monte made a similar observation in <em>Network Attacks and Exploitation: A Framework</em>, where he cautioned that, &#8220;Too much awareness can also be paralyzing. With too many dots, you can connect them to form any picture. Shadowes emerge from the information.&#8221; This section will only contribute to that problem, although corroboration from multiple sources may present an opportunity to score indicators to aid in their prioritization..</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="PublicThreatIntelligenceFeeds">Public Threat Intelligence Feeds<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublicThreatIntelligenceFeeds">#</a></span></h5>

<p>The following public threat feeds, listed in alphabetical order, provide primarily network indicators such as IP addresses and domain names. Some also include host indicators like file hashes or mutexes as well.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="EnrichmentFeeds">Enrichment Feeds<span>&nbsp;<a href="#EnrichmentFeeds">#</a></span></h5>

<p>Although not threat feeds, these sources may be integrated in a similar manner as those listed above to provide important contextual information during analysis.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://umbrella-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/index.html">Cisco Umbrella</a></li>
<li><a href="https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million">Majestic Million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">Tranco</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Although as Samaneh Tajalizadehkhoob explains in <a href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/samaneh_tajalizadehkhoob_1/the-tale-of-website-popularity-rankings-an-extensive-analysis/"><em>The Tale of Website Popularity Rankings: An Extensive Analysis</em></a> these lists have series problems <em>especially when used as allowlists</em>, tagging DNS queries with their rankings can be an interesting data point to inform an analyst&#8217;s evaluation.</p>

<p>Similarly, tagging IP addresses as public DNS servers or cloud infrastructure can also remove a step for analysts.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://public-dns.info/">Public DNS servers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">AWS IP ranges</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json">GCP IP ranges</a>.</li>
<li>Azure IP ranges from Microsoft, via: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=56519">Azure public cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=57063">Azure US Government cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=57064">Azure German cloud</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=57062">Azure China cloud</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4">Cloudflare IPv4 ranges</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6">Cloudflare IPv6 ranges</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Andre Toonk explained an interesting approach to mapping cloud IP space in <a href="https://toonk.io/aws-and-their-billions-in-ipv4-addresses/index.html"><em>AWS and their Billions in IPv4 addresses</em></a>. Although the lists above are a good start, a more complete approach to tagging cloud infrastructure would involve techniques such as those Andre describes.</p>

<p>The sheer volume of indicators from feeds like these makes using them a challenge. They also tend to disagree, as documented in papers such as <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/bouwman"><em>A different cup of TI? The added value of commercial threat intelligence</em></a>, which leads many to consider them not only more trouble than they are worth, but also unreliable. As those papers allude to, however, and as Timo Steffens explains in <em>Attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats: How to Identify the Actors Behind Cyber-Espionage</em>, such disagreement&#160;&#8212;&#160;and, to an extent, volume as well&#160;&#8212;&#160;is likely due to differences in collection. Entities with varying collection capabilities, that also collect data from multiple sectors and across the world, reach different conclusions based on those different data sets. This explains the common practice of vendor-specific threat actor naming conventions, which <em>must</em> vary to account for differences in the data underlying those assessments. Each entity has a piece of the puzzle that, when considered together, forms a more complete picture. Consider this overwhelming volume a feature, not a bug, that helps bring that picture into focus. Nikolaos Serketzis et. al. describes the benefit of an automated indicator correlation system in their paper <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/11/7/162/htm"><em>Improving Forensic Triage Efficiency through Cyber Threat Intelligence</em></a>, which relied on that volume to identify relationships between indicators. Stephen Shinol described a similar concept in <a href="https://inquest.net/blog/2018/05/17/aggregating-public-domain-reputation-feeds"><em>Aggregating Public Domain Reputation Feeds</em></a>.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="IndicatorResearch">Indicator Research<span>&nbsp;<a href="#IndicatorResearch">#</a></span></h4>

<p>This section lists public tools and resources for indicator research. They give analysts critical contextual information to inform their priorities and guide their hunts. As Zane Pokorny explained in Recorded Future&#8217;s <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/ebooks/threat-intelligence-handbook.pdf"><em>The Threat Intelligence Handbook</em></a>, &#8220;An analyst attempting to triage an initial alert without access to enough context is like a person trying to understand a news story after reading just the headline. ... This enrichment enables SOC analysts to quickly identify the most significant threats and take immediate, informed actions to resolve them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Analysts may consider using these tools through intermediary infrastructure, and limiting their use where possible, to avoid tipping off adversaries by inadvertantely prompting a scan of their infrastructure, for example, or by uploading bespoke malware to a public sandbox.</p>

<p>The list below consists of two sections: one for primarily network-focused indicator research of IP addresses, domains, and the like, and another for primarily host-focused indicator research of file hashes and executables. In many cases, however, these tools do not fit neatly into one category or the other. Many malware sandboxes, for example, accept file uploads but also allow users to search their reports for IP address and domain matches. This can help associate anomalous network activity with known malware, or vice-versa. I binned these tools according to their main function, but took care to identify those secondary uses in their descriptions.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="NetworkFocusedIndicatorResearch">Network-Focused Indicator Research<span>&nbsp;<a href="#NetworkFocusedIndicatorResearch">#</a></span></h5>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://stat.ripe.net/">https://stat.ripe.net/</a> - RIPEstat provides current and historical IP address, ASN, and domain lookups, plus Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) information. Although other Regional Internet Registries may have similar data, RIPE does the best job presenting it. RIPEstat&#8217;s greatest value-add is its BGP routing information: whereas IP geolocation is woefully inaccurate, BGP routes allow analysts to view the actual path Internet traffic to from source to destination through various core routers at known locations across the globe. This enables analysts to map the logical Internet to the physical world and incorporate accurate geolocation into their analysis. <a href="https://bgp.he.net/">https://bgp.he.net/</a>, <a href="https://bgpview.io/">https://bgpview.io/</a>, and <a href="https://bgp.tools/">https://bgp.tools/</a> all provide similar information through different interfaces. See also the University of Oregon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/">Route Views Project</a>, which collects and makes available BGP data from across the globe. Services like Cisco&#8217;s <a href="https://bgpstream.com/">BGPStream</a> and the Georgia Institute of Technology&#8217;s <a href="https://grip.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/">Global Routing Intelligence Platform</a> help identify anomalous BGP events like BGP hijacks.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.threatminer.org/">https://www.threatminer.org/</a> - Open-source threat indicator database. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.threatcrowd.org/">https://www.threatcrowd.org/</a> - Open-source threat intelligence database that also includes geolocation and routing info.</li>
<li><a href="https://pulsedive.com">https://pulsedive.com</a> - Pulsedive is a free threat intelligence platform that provides indicator lookup tools as well as threat group information and indicator feeds. It&#8217;s Pro account is reasonably priced, but even with just the free version, Pulsedive provides access to a lot of helpful information in a simple interface that supports a productive pivoting workflow.</li>
<li><a href="https://greynoise.io/">https://greynoise.io/</a> - Greynoise records instances of malicious activity across the Internet through its vast network of honeypots. Through its simple interface you can identify SSH brute forcers, scanners, malware traffic, and many other types of activity. This tool provides helpful context when determining whether a network was targeted or simply another endpoint in a long, generic list. With a free account, you can also set up alerts to monitor specific networks or look for certain activity. <a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com/">AbuseIPDB</a> can provide some similar information.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shodan.io/">https://www.shodan.io/</a> - Shodan provides users with rich results of its regular internet scans. Through its interface, users can view information such as open ports, web page content, and service information without ever interacting with the actual host. It also enables users to pivot from IP to domain to certificate, and any other combination of those three. Although Shodan <em>can</em> scan hosts on-demand, this requires using the back-end API. Using this tool as a search engine does <em>not</em> cause it to interact with anything. <a href="https://netlas.io/">Netlas.io</a> and <a href="https://natlas.io/">Natlas.io</a>, not to be confused with each other, both provide access to similar data through a similar query language.</li>
<li><a href="https://censys.io/">https://censys.io/</a> - Censys provides passive IP, domain, and certificate lookups. For hosts, it includes open ports, geolocation, and WHOIS information; for certificates, fingerprint, keys, signatures, and other pertinent information. Based on the Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository at scans.io. <a href="https://spyse.com/">Spyse</a>, <a href="https://www.onyphe.io/">ONYPHE</a>, <a href="https://www.criminalip.io/">Criminal IP</a>, and CIRCL&#8217;s <a href="https://www.circl.lu/services/passive-ssl/">PassiveSSL</a> project provide access to similar data, although Censys operates one of the largest, fastest, and most complete internet scanners in existence.. Google&#8217;s <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Dataset Search</a> search engine makes finding these types of data sets easy.</li>
<li><a href="https://fullhunt.io/">https://fullhunt.io/</a> - FullHunt helps organizations understand their external attack surface. Shodan, Netlas, and Natlas can provide similar information.</li>
<li><a href="https://leakix.net/">https://leakix.net/</a> - LeakIX is an internet search engine similar to Shodan and Censys that also offers a convenient report generation feature for easy information sharing.</li>
<li><a href="https://crt.sh/">https://crt.sh/</a> - crt.sh provides simple, free SSL certificate lookups.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.riskiq.com/login">https://community.riskiq.com/login</a> - Think of RiskIQ as &#8220;Censys+&#8221;: it provides current and historical IP, passive DNS, reverse DNS, and certificate lookups&#160;&#8212;&#160;and some OSINT integration&#160;&#8212;&#160;that enables analysts to quickly pivot from an one indicator to another. <a href="https://dnsdumpster.com/">DNS Dumpster</a> and <a href="https://dnsviz.net/">DNSViz</a> provide access to DNS information only.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.domaintools.com/">https://www.domaintools.com/</a> - In some ways Domain Tools has even better information than RiskIQ. With better retention, fewer limits, and a productive pivoting workflow that documents investigations as analysts execute them, Domain Tools wins out over all alternatives.</li>
<li><a href="https://typosquatting-finder.circl.lu/">https://typosquatting-finder.circl.lu/</a> - Circl.lu&#8217;s typosquatting finder makes identifying potential typosquats of an initial seed domain easy: simply input an initial domain name and Circl.lu will return similar active domains.</li>
<li><a href="https://intelx.io/">https://intelx.io/</a> - Intelligence X scrapes information from a variety of locations, including the dark web. While not an indicator lookup tool in the same way that others in this list are, providing information about the indicator itself, this platform provides interesting contextual information to analysts. Think of Intelligence X as more of a research platform for OSINT.</li>
<li><a href="https://synapsint.com/">https://synapsint.com/</a> - A cross between lookup tools in this list and Intelligence X, SynapsInt aggregates indicator information as well as contextual information from pastes, blacklists, and other sources from around the internet. Synapsint also returns screenshots when given a website as input. but for investigating and pivoting off of websites, see the tools below.</li>
<li>Following the identification of a malicious website such as a front for a C2 server, a watering hole, or a phishing lure, web scraper data can generate several interesting leads. Tools like <a href="https://urlscan.io/">URLScan</a> from SecurityTrails allow users to run public, unlisted, or private &#8220;scans&#8221; to view a website&#8217;s content without directly interacting with it. <a href="https://www.nerdydata.com/">Nerdy Data</a>, <a href="https://spyonweb.com/">SpyOnWeb</a>, and <a href="https://publicwww.com/">PublicWWW</a> specialize in finding related websites based on similarities like code reuse, tracking codes, and common technology stacks. Shodan even allows users to search a page&#8217;s content for key words, code reuse, or even unique colors. The <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl project</a> scrapes content from across the internet and then makes it available for download through its website and <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/commoncrawl/">via Amazon</a>. Enterprising data scientists could use this raw data to feed a local tool for identifying similar websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://nslookup.io">https://nslookup.io</a> - This website provides simple, free DNS lookups for a variety of DNS resolvers. This can be useful to identify instances where most DNS resolvers return a legitimate server to a legitimate DNS request, but an adversary has co-opted others to return their illegitimate server instead. Shodan now provides similar functionality in their tool <a href="https://geonet.shodan.io/">Geonet</a>, which can ping or execute DNS lookups from servers around the world.</li>

While analysts should take care when using this or any other online platform to avoid tipping their hand to a watchful adversary, this tool can help speed up the pace of analysis by reducing the need to run single queries across multiple websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://expireddomains.net/">https://expireddomains.net/</a> - ExpiredDomains.net does exactly what its name implies: lists expired (and expiring) domains. This is a useful source for detecting recently expired or transferred domains an adversary might use to obfuscate their activity. In  <a href="https://www.sans.org/white-papers/40505/"><em>Expired Domain Dumpster Diving</em></a>, Christopher DeWeese discusses this technique and detection methods.</li>
<li><a href="https://packettotal.com/">https://packettotal.com/</a> - PacketTotal does for network packet captures what VirusTotal does for malware samples: it performs cursory analysis of the file and highlights interesting information for analysts. While it would be inappropriate for a defensive cyber analyst to upload PCAP from a government network to this service, PacketTotal also offers an indicator lookup feature. This can provide analysts with helpful contextual information such as whether or not anyone else has observed and flagged a particular domain or IP address in their network traffic.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">https://www.virustotal.com/</a> - VirusTotal is the premiere indicator research tool. Given just a single indicator, it can identify malware samples with matching C2 domains and IP addresses, access historical antivirus scan results for that malware based on its hash, and even provide detailed sandbox reports that describe its execution flow. VirusTotal is the first stop for many threat researchers, and for good reason. <a href="https://metadefender.opswat.com/">MetaDefender</a>, <a href="https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/">Hybrid Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.joesandbox.com">Joe&#8217;s Sandbox</a>, <a href="https://polyswarm.network/">Polyswarm</a>, <a href="https://app.any.run/">Any.Run</a>, <a href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/">ThreatFox</a>, <a href="https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/">Malware Bazaar</a>,and <a href="https://www.malwares.com/">Malwares</a> all provide similar functionality with some interesting differences, such as Malwares&#8217; ability to search for malware exploiting specific CVEs, filter based on malware like Cobalt Strike, and identify types of malware like webshells. Many of these websites also allow analysts to upload their own samples for analysis and correlation, but defenders should generally avoid doing so. Some threat actors monitor platforms like these for their own malware: once their binaries appear, they know to adjust their techniques or operational timeline to stay ahead of the network defenders. Take care not to tip your hand. When these tools match potential malware samples against tens of engines, also take care not to over-index on a single result. Some analysts get hung up on files that just one vendor flags as malicious, but keep in mind the practice of &#8220;antivirus thresholding&#8221;, in which some minimum number of antivirus engines must detect a file as malicious in order for it to be considered a true positive. This applies to other indicator types as well, but especially to file hashes and antivirus engines.</li>

<h4 class="headers" id="ThreatActorInformation">Threat Actor Information<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ThreatActorInformation">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Researchers have done extensive work to characterize the peculiarities of individual threat actors. In many cases, these robust threat profiles detail past activities, likely future targets, and catalog adversary activity from initial compromise all the way through data exfiltration to include the tools they use. Use this information, these tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs), and known tool sets to inform the information collection matrix (the detection mechanisms that will help find the actors) and defensive engineering plan (the countermeasures that will confound them). As you work through a cyber threat framework, and the indicators begin to point to a few actors, use these resources to gather more information on them. This section lists public resources for threat actor research.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.thaicert.or.th/downloads/files/A_Threat_Actor_Encyclopedia.pdf">A Threat Actor Encyclopedia</a> - ThaiCERT compiles threat profiles based on open-source reporting into a single, easily searched and referenced document. Look to this excellent resource for information to inform your intelligence assessments. The <a href="https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/aptgroups.cgi">accompanying website</a> makes filtering through this trove of information easier.</li>
<li><a href="https://vx-underground.org/apts">https://vx-underground.org/apts</a> - VX Underground does an excellent job of aggregating APT reporting, malware samples, and informational papers. This repository includes not just current information, but also reports going all the way back to 2010. This is a wealth of information to better understand advanced, persistent threats. The <a href="https://github.com/aptnotes/data">APT Notes</a> repository aggregates similar information, providing an easy way to access publicly available reports and blog posts about APT activity.</li>
<li><a href="https://apt.threattracking.com">https://apt.threattracking.com</a> - This crowdsourced resource not only standardizes APT names, but also catalogs their tool suites, TTPs, and reports on their activity. The <a href="https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/EternalLiberty">EternalLiberty</a> project does the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">https://attack.mitre.org/</a> - MITRE&#8217;s ATT&#38;CK matrix does two valuable things: first, it associates techniques with stages in a compromise. Phishing, for example, is used for initial access, after which the creation of scheduled tasks may be used for persistence. This is helpful because it can focus analytic priorities: without a reason to suspect an adversary has already gained access to a network, analysts should focus on identifying techniques used in the early stages of a compromise; during an incident response, they may work backwards from end actions to discover the initial avenue of approach&#160;&#8212;&#160;what authors Roman Daszczyszak, Steve Luke, and Sean Whitley in <em>TTP-Based Hunting</em> called &#8220;pulling the thread&#8221;. The second valuable thing this website does is associate techniques with threat groups. If Iranian actors may be targeting a network, for example, use this resource to identify techniques previously associated with these groups for which analysts can then search. The MITRE ATT&#38;CK framework also facilities overlaying observed techniques in time, which aids in briefing senior leaders. MITRE provides the ATT&#38;CK matrix in several forms on its <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/working-with-attack/">Working with ATT&CK</a> page, which also lists tools for working with it. For help building detections for MITRE techniques, check out MITRE&#8217;s <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">Cyber Analytics Repository</a> and the <a href="https://controlcompass.github.io/">Control Validation Compass</a> tool; for help understanding how to defend against or detect specific techniques, check out MITRE&#8217;s <a href="https://d3fend.mitre.org/">D3FEND</a> framework and the accompanying informative white paper <a href="https://www.sans.org/white-papers/sans-2022-att-ck-and-d3fend-report-incorporating-frameworks-into-your-analysis-and-intelligence/"><em>SANS 2022 ATT&#38;CK and D3FEND Report: Incorporating Frameworks into Your Analysis and Intelligence</em></a>. MITRE also maintains the <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/index.html">Common Attack Pattern Enumerations and Classifications</a> (CAPEC) project, which describes entire attack chains.</li>
<li><a href="https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise">https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise</a> - The ATT&#38;CK Navigator provides an easy way to visualize ATT&#38;CK coverage and tie APTs to techniques; exporting these products can aid in the creation of interesting overlays. The <a href="https://ma-insights.vercel.app/">MA Insights</a> webapp provides other helpful visualizations for the ATT&#38;CK matrix and known adversary activity.</li>
<li><a href="https://atc-project.github.io/atc-react/">https://atc-project.github.io/atc-react/</a> - The RE&#38;CT Framework, based on ATT&#38;CK, provides a similar taxonomy of blue tactics, techniques, and procedures for incident responses. This project also has its own version of the ATT&#38;CK Navigator, making it easy to visualize gaps in defender capabilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://atlas.mitre.org/">https://atlas.mitre.org/</a> - MITRE&#8217;s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems (ATLAS) project catalogs adversary tactics, techniques, and case studies for artificial intelligence systems in a similar way that the ATT&#38;CK matrix catalogs adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures for enterprise, cloud, and ICS/SCADA environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://unprotect.it/">https://unprotect.it/</a> - The Unprotect Project catalogs evasion techniques, proof of concept code snippets, and detection rules. This resource can help analysts not only understand <em>a</em> way to detect something, but also other opportunities for detection as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/">https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/</a> - Palo Alto&#8217;s Unit 42 Playbook Viewer provides information similar to the ATT&#38;CK Navigator, in the last bullet, with some notable differences. For one, it not only breaks down the TTPs for individual actors across the MITRE ATT&#38;CK Matrix, it also maps this information to the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain. The Playbook Viewer also presents this information for individual operations, rather than the group as a whole, and includes indicators for most of the techniques, too. See also the <a href="https://ma-insights.vercel.app/">MA Insights</a> webapp, which provides helpful visualizations to accompany its threat actor overviews based on the ATT&#38;CK matrix.</li>

<p>This section lists several useful resources for gathering vulnerability information, key to rounding out your understanding of the desires, abilities, and <em>opportunities</em> of your adversaries. Fortunately, as the authors of <a href="https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=644720"><em>Historical Analysis of Exploit Availability Timelines</em></a> explain, &#8220;On the one hand, relatively few CVE-IDs have exploit code publicly available.&#8221; Unfortunately, as they also explain, &#8220;On the other hand, for those CVE-IDs that do, it is usually public quite quickly&#160;&#8212;&#160;the median time is within two days.&#8221; Worse, as Jonathan Spring, Sarah Kern, and Alec Summers describe in <a href="https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=438870"><em>Global Adversarial Capability Modeling</em></a>, the Adversary Capability Chain model shows actor capability progressing from the skilled and well-financed in the early days of a system&#8217;s existence to those with fewer resources later in its life. This is an important point that proves systems remain vulnerable over time, the actor likely to exploit those vulnerabilities just changes. While these resources will not make the patching process easier, they will help identify the vulnerabilities most in need of immediate attention.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">https://nvd.nist.gov/</a> - NIST&#8217;s National Vulnerability Database provides an overwhelming amount of information on this topic. Search for information about individual vulnerabilities to better understand detection opportunities, or search for individual technologies to understand your organization&#8217;s exposure. <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/">CVE Details</a> provides access to the same information through a different interface. <a href="https://www.cloudvulndb.org/">The Open Cloud Vulnerability &#38; Security Issue Database</a> catalogs cloud vulnerabilities, which do not receive CVE designations as other vulnerabilities do.</li>

<li><a href="https://cvestalker.com/">https://cvestalker.com/</a> - CVE Stalker aggregates information about vulnerabilities from Twitter. This can also help prioritize patching by helping analysts understand the prevalence of, and discussion surrounding, new vulnerabilities. <a href="http://CVEtrends.com">CVE Trends</a> provides similar information. <a href="https://greynoise.io/">GreyNoise</a> also provides a helpful Trends page that not only shows vulnerability exploit attempts over time, but also provides static and automated IP block lists as well. These tools make it easy to quickly get up to speed on new vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/">https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/</a> - The Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute CERT Coordination Center maintains a database with detailed information about public vulnerabilities.

<li><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">https://www.exploit-db.com/</a> - Unlike others in this list, Exploit Database does not provide information about vulnerabilities&#160;&#8212;&#160;it provides the actual code to exploit them. Defensive forces should use websites like this to better understand exploits in order to develop detection mechanisms. Rapid 7 also maintains a <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/">Vulnerability &#38; Exploit Database</a>, and <a href="https://sploitus.com/">Sploitus</a> contains similar information.</li>

<h4 class="headers" id="RuleRepositories">Rule Repositories<span>&nbsp;<a href="#RuleRepositories">#</a></span></h4>

<p>This book contained tens of queries designed to identify evidence of malicious activity. This section lists several repositories where analysts can find even more rules. These repositories run the gamut in terms of quality; analysts should take care not to implement all, or even many, without careful review and testing. Analysts must strike a delicate balance between strict rules easily circumvented, and lax rules that yield too much noise. Generally speaking, as the true positive rate increases, so does the false negative rate; as the false positive rate increases, the false negative rate decreases. </p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://car.mitre.org/">https://car.mitre.org/</a> - MITRE&#8217;s Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) details detections for the techniques its ATT&#38;CK matrix details. Although not yet complete, CAR already contains tens of rules for multiple platforms written in multiple query languages. Also check out <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/car">the accompanying GitHub repository</a> for a more machine-friendly version of these rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma">https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma</a> - The Sigma project describes rules in a SIEM-agnostic way.

<li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel">https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel</a> - Although geared toward Azure Sentinel, both the &#8220;Detections&#8221; and &#8220;Hunting Queries&#8221; folders contain logic for rules that can be ported to any SIEM. Microsoft also maintains a separate repository, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries">Advanced hunting queries for Microsoft 365 Defender</a>, with similarly useful rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chronicle/detection-rules">https://github.com/chronicle/detection-rules</a> - Although not as extensive as other repositories in this list, Google&#8217;s Chronicle detection rules may provide inspiration for custom ones.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/">https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/</a> - Although built for Elastic Security, the logic in these rules can be ported to any SIEM. Elastic even ties their detections to MITRE ATT&#38;CK techniques for easier prioritization. Elastic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-rules.html">Prebuilt Rules</a> documentation also describes hundreds of rules built into Elastic Security. See also Elastic&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts">Protection Artifacts</a> repository which contains the detection logic for Elastic Security for endpoint.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FalconForceTeam/FalconFriday">https://github.com/FalconForceTeam/FalconFriday</a> - FalconForce updates this repository bi-weekly with new Microsoft Defender for Endpoint rules that, again, analysts may port to the SIEM of their choosing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics</a> - Google&#8217;s Community Security Analytics (CSA) project seeks to provide defenders with a repository for uncovering malicious activity within Google&#8217;s cloud environment. Again, analysts may look to these rules for inspiration or translate them as necessary.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules">https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules</a> - Mandiant&#8217;s rule repo for the <code>capa</code> tool, which analyzes executables in an attempt to determine their true function, does not apply as directly to SIEM rule generation as other entries in this list do. However, when writing host-based Yara rules, for example, this repository may provide some helpful inspiration. For more on Yara rules, see the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules">Yara Rules</a>. Tools like <a href="https://yaradbg.dev/">Yara Debug</a> can also help troubleshoot those rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OTRF/ThreatHunter-Playbook">https://github.com/OTRF/ThreatHunter-Playbook</a> - Although a work in progress, the Open Threat Research Forge&#8217;s ThreatHunter Playbook already contains several analytics for its Jupyter Notebook-based analysis environment.

<li><a href="https://github.com/palantir/alerting-detection-strategy-framework">https://github.com/palantir/alerting-detection-strategy-framework</a> - Sigma has become the <em>de facto</em> industry standard for generic SIEM rules, but Palantir&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/alerting-and-detection-strategy-framework-52dc33722df2"><em>Alerting and Detection Strategy Framework</em></a> complements it nicely. With helpful information for detection engineers and analysts alike such as &#8220;Blind Spots and Assumptions&#8221;, &#8220;Priority&#8221;, and &#8220;Response&#8221;, this framework helps turn low-context and thus low-value rules into defensible bases for investigations.</li>

<li><a href="https://research.splunk.com/detections/">https://research.splunk.com/detections/</a> - Splunk mapped its massive detection repository to the MITRE ATT&#38;CK tactics, grouped them by platform, and posted them for everyone to use. Although geared toward Splunk, analysts can port this logic to other platforms, too.</li>
<li><a href="https://rules.emergingthreats.net/">https://rules.emergingthreats.net/</a> - Proofpoint&#8217;s Emerging Threats repository contains rules designed for Snort and Suricata. While analysts could port their logic to a SIEM, these rules are best suited to generating alerts for analysts to review through those intrusion detection systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://socprime.com/">https://socprime.com/</a> - While SOC Prime offers some rules for free, most of its content is behind a paywall. Explore the free rules and consider upgrading if this book and these other sources do not suffice.</li>
<li><a href="https://uncoder.io/">https://uncoder.io/</a> - Uncoder translates Sigma rules for different SIEMs.</li>
</ul>

<p>These repositories contain thousands of rules. This should make obvious the fact that the limiting factor in uncovering malicious activity has never been (nor will it ever be) the analyst&#8217;s ability to understand adversary tradecraft and create mechanisms to detect it; the limiting factor has always been (and forever will be) the <em>organization&#8217;s</em> willingness to enable those analysts with correct and complete data in a stable platform. As long as the organization can satisfy those criteria, its ability to detect even the most advanced threat actors will then become a question of expertise and a rigorous methodology. Each of those challenges are solvable.</p>

<p>For help prioritizing the alerts they produce, check out Josh Lemon&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.joshlemon.com.au/"><em>Cybersecurity Alert Priority Matrix</em></a>.</p>

<p>Although robust rule repositories are helpful, as David Duggan et. al. explained in <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/downloads/categorizing-threat-building-and-using-generic-threat-matrix"><em>Categorizing Threat: Building and Using a Generic Threat Matrix</em></a> it is impractical to keep up with the threat landscape. Instead, defenders must defend against general threats rather than specific ones, which the recommendations in the rest of this book support. As a general rule, defenders should be threat-informed but threat-agnostic.</p>

<h5 class="headers" id="ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ArtificialIntelligence">#</a></span></h5>

<p>The beginning of 2023 saw the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools. Like machine learning algorithms, these have massive potential in the defensive cyber field. The list below includes links to several AI platforms analysts can use to speed up routine tasks like generating reports, for example, or more complex tasks like writing detection rules. Most require free accounts.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">https://chat.openai.com/</a> - OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT large language model (LLM) provides a simple, easy way to automate routine tasks and solve semi-complex problems. The <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground">playground</a> is better suited for more long-form questions and scenarios.</li>
<li><a href="https://bard.google.com/">https://bard.google.com/</a> - Google&#8217;s Bard LLM serves a similar function as ChatGPT.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bing.com/new">https://www.bing.com/new</a> - Bing&#8217;s LLM, built in to Bing Search, provides similar capabilities as ChatGPT and Bard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several websites also provide access to these and other LLMs through their own interfaces. These can be viable alternatives to rate limiting via the main platform&#8217;s front-end. Check out <a href="https://www.forefront.ai/">ForeFront</a> (GPT-4/3.5), <a href="https://poe.com">Poe</a> (GPT-4/3.5), <a href="https://writesonic.com">Write Sonic</a> (GPT-3.5/Internet), <a href="https://t3nsor.com">T3nsor</a> (GPT-3.5), </p>
<p><a href="https://you.com">You</a> (GPT-3.5/ Internet), and <a href="https://sqlchat.ai">SQL Chat</a> (GPT-3.5).</p>

<p>Note that these tools should generally be used for discrete and well-bounded problems such as writing a report based on clear guidelines, for example, but not for solving complex problems. While they may appear to exhibit some level of actual intelligence suitable for problem solving, this is a facade.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="IntroductoryResources">Introductory Resources<span>&nbsp;<a href="#IntroductoryResources">#</a></span></h4>

<p>This post&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the book that inspired it&#160;&#8212;&#160;is not intended to be an introduction to computer science, IT, or cybersecurity, nor is it intended to be an introduction to math, data science, or data analysis, formal analytic methodologies, or structured analytic techniques. This section lists several resources geared towards those in need of that foundational knowledge. While none of them will make you an expert, they will give you enough background information to know where to go next.</p>

<p>The SANS <a href="http://sansurl.com/newtocyber"><em>New to Cyber Field Manual</em></a> also contains a collection of helpful introductory resources. Mandiant also maintains the <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/cti-analyst-core-competencies-framework"><em>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Analyst Core Competencies Framework</em></a>, a descriptive rather than prescriptive document that may help guide the studies of aspiring cyber threat intelligence analysts.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://dcic-world.org/"><em>A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing</em></a> by Kathi Fisler, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Benjamin Lerner, and Joe Politz. This book covers the gammut of computer science topics from low-level programming to data structures and algorithms.</li>
<li><a href="https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html"><em>Computer Security and the Internet: Tools and Jewels</em></a> by Paul van Oorschot. This book provides an introduction to fundamental cybersecurity concepts. It will not turn anyone into a security expert, but it will&#160;&#8212;&#160;in the course of a weekend&#160;&#8212;&#160;provide enough background knowledge for this field to start making sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/"><em>Practical Python</em></a> and its follow-on course <a href="https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery"><em>Advanced Python Mastery</em></a> by David Beazley are great introductions to programming in the approachable and versatile Python language.</li>
<li><a href="https://openintro-ims2.netlify.app/"><em>Introduction to Modern Statistics</em></a> by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin. This book explains important data science topics in an approachable way and also includes slides, labs, and interactive tutorials to help the learning process.

Each of these courses feature helpful learning material as well as instructive hands-on exercises and labs.</li>
<li><em>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</em> - Richards Heuer Jr.&#8217;s famous book on intelligence analysis not only explains the need for structured analytic techniques but also gives its readers tools to succeed. Technical analysts must not discount the importance of sound analytic techniques, which have a critical role to play given the uncertainty inherent in the fifth domain. The CIA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/publications-rss-updates/tradecraft-primer-may-4-2009.html"><em>A Tradecraft Primer: Structured Analytic Techniques for Improving Intelligence Analysis</em></a> provides a more concise overview of these valuable methodologies. See ICD 203: <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf"><em>Analytic Standards</em></a> for another helpful document to aid in the production of sound intelligence estimates, concepts which cyber analysts can also apply to their field. Sherman Kent&#8217;s <em>Words of Estimative Probability</em> describes the history of estimative language and early attempts to define it.</li>

<h5 class="headers" id="TrainingOrganizations">Training Organizations<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TrainingOrganizations">#</a></span></h5>

<p>This section contains a list of individuals, groups, and companies well-respected for their quality cyber training.</p>

<p>For general cybersecurity career planning, I recommend reviewing the <a href="https://www.cyberhuntingguide.net/"><em>How to Start a Cybersecurity Career</em></a> graphic, the related <a href="https://shellsharks.com/cybersecurity-role-map"><em>Cybersecurity Role Map</em></a>, and Lesley Carhart&#8217;s <a href="https://tisiphone.net/2015/11/08/starting-an-infosec-career-the-megamix-chapters-4-5/"><em>Starting an InfoSec Career – The Megamix – Chapters 4-5</em></a> for some help here. Mike Sass&#8217;s <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/infosec-skillsets.html"><em>Infosec Skill Sets</em></a> breaks down this nebulous field into domains in a similar form as Henry Jiang&#8217;s famous <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-domain-map-ver-30-henry-jiang"><em>Cybersecurity Domain Map</em></a>,<a href="https://shellsharks.com/getting-into-information-security"><em>Getting Into Information Security</em></a> describes how to get into this field, and his article <a href="https://shellsharks.com/training-retrospective"><em>A 5 Year Infosec Education Retrospective</em></a> contains good guidance on training, education, and certification. You may also find Paul Jerimy&#8217;s <a href="https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/"><em>Security Certification Roadmap</em></a> helpful as well. I also frequently refer people to SANS&#8217;s helpful <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-skills-roadmap/">Cyber Security Roadmap</a> as well as CompTIA&#8217;s more general <a href="https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/08314-it-certification-roadmap-nov2020-update-8-5x11-online">IT Certification Roadmap</a>. Together these should give you an idea of the career paths available in this field and what it would take to go down them; from there we can make a plan for your future.</p>

<p>In Mike Sass&#8217; fantastic article, <a href="https://shellsharks.com/training-retrospective"><em>A 5 Year Infosec Education Retrospective Best Of: A Collection of Reviews, Advice and Antiquity</em></a>, he makes the great point that training takes time, money and motivation. Leaders can provide time and money, and they can try to provide motivation as well, but students have a big role to play in that third area.</p>

<p>The following list breaks down individuals, groups, and companies according to their primary area of focus, offense or defense. Note, though, that in some cases an organization that offers many offensive courses and therefore is in the "Offensive&#8217;&#8217; category might also offer some defensive ones, and vice-versa. For brevity&#8217;s sake, I avoided duplicating most list entries.</p>

<h6 class="headers" id="Offensive">Offensive<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Offensive">#</a></span></h6>
