<p>Thanks in no small part to OpenAI&#8217;s <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>, the past year has seen an explosion in interest in artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular. That democratization of access turned this niche research area into a common topic of conversation, and has led to a lot of fascinating writing on the subject.

<h3 class="headers" id="ApplicationsforArtificialIntelligence">Applications for Artificial Intelligence<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ApplicationsforArtificialIntelligence">#</a></span></h3>

<p>This section contains some reading on applications&#160;&#8212;&#160;and limitations&#160;&#8212;&#160;of artificial intelligence.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html"><em>Agents</em></a>. Chip Huyen adapted a chapter of his book <a href="https://amzn.to/49j1cGS"><em>AI Engineering</em></a> that delves deeply into the theory and possible structure of effective artificial intelligence agents. Many of these ideas fit well with Microsoft&#8217;s observations in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"><em>Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early Experiments with GPT-4</em></a>, when the authors theorized about the future potential of GPT-4-like models to act on their own. I found Chip&#8217;s discussion of the ability of large language models to plan particularly interesting. Also check out Anthropic&#8217;s article, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents"><em>Building effective agents</em></a>. In <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage"><em>The Bitter Lesson versus The Garbage Can</em></a>, Ethan Mollick makes the interesting case that to be successful, agents won&#8217;t need to understand specific processes to optimize them.</li>
<li><a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-reasoning-llms"><em>Understanding Reasoning LLMs</em></a>. Shortly after DeepSeek R1 was released, Sebastian Raschka wrote a great article explaining where reasoning models excel, where they fall short, and how to build them. Also check out the article in series on reasoning models, <a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/state-of-llm-reasoning-and-inference-scaling"><em>The State of LLM Reasoning Models</em></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ezyang.github.io/ai-blindspots/"><em>AI Blindspots</em></a>. Just as important as understanding the power of artificial intelligence is understanding where it falls short. Although these examples are programming-specific, the general lessons are applicable for more broadly.</li>
<li><a href="https://codinginterviewsmadesimple.substack.com/p/fine-tuning-llms-is-a-huge-waste"><em>Fine‑Tuning LLMs is a Huge Waste of Time</em></a>. Devansh argues that fine-tuning LLMs for knowledge injection is often overrated, suggesting that alternative methods&#160;&#8212;&#160;like retrieval-augmented generation and prompt engineering&#160;&#8212;&#160;are more effective and cost-efficient. <a href="https://artificialintelligencemadesimple.substack.com/p/a-new-way-to-control-language-model"><em>A New Way to Control Language Model Generations</em></a> explores some of those alternative ways. </li>
</ul>

<p>There is a growing body of work that demonstrates the value of compute over craftsmanship: run large batches of jobs, sample widely, then select the optimal answer. These articles explain the underexplored opportunities and challenges of this approach.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685"><em>Judging LLM‑as‑a‑Judge with MT‑Bench and Chatbot Arena</em></a>. Lianmin Zheng and colleagues from UC Berkeley and UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University and MBZUAI show that large language models can act as effective evaluators of other models. They introduce MT‑Bench and Chatbot Arena, benchmarks in which GPT‑4 and similar &#8220;judge&#8221; models rate chat‑assistant responses. After correcting for position and verbosity biases and acknowledging limits in reasoning ability, these LLM judges match human preferences on more than 80 % of cases. The authors argue this &#8220;LLM‑as‑judge&#8221; approach scales open‑ended evaluation but needs careful design to avoid self‑enhancement bias.</li>
<li><a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/eval-process/"><em>An LLM‑as‑Judge Won&#8217;t Save The Product&#160;&#8212;&#160;Fixing Your Process Will</em></a>. Amazon Principal Applied Scientist Eugene Yan critiques the belief that adding another LLM evaluator will magically improve an AI product. He advocates treating evaluations as scientific experiments: examine data and user interactions, annotate failures and successes to build balanced evaluation sets, formulate hypotheses about why models fail, and run controlled experiments. Automated evaluators can help, but they must be calibrated with human‑labeled &#8220;golden&#8221; data and incorporated into an evaluation‑driven development loop. Yan warns that without disciplined human oversight&#160;&#8212;&#160;regular sampling, annotation and hypothesis‑driven iteration&#160;&#8212;&#160;LLM judges alone cannot ensure product quality.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/10/09/who-watches-the-watchers-llm-on-llm-evaluations/"><em>Who watches the watchers? LLM on LLM evaluations</em></a>. Stack Overflow staff writer Ryan Donovan explains why teams are using LLMs to judge other LLMs and the challenges that come with this strategy. Automated judges correlate well with human judgements but exhibit biases: they prefer longer answers, pick the first answer, and struggle with math. To mitigate these issues, companies such as Etsy and Prosus build &#8220;golden datasets&#8221; and use teacher‑model ensembles where multiple LLMs cross‑check each other. Donovan stresses that human oversight is still essential&#160;&#8212;&#160;evaluation criteria must be clear, and datasets must be updated continually because static benchmarks quickly become obsolete.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05410"><em>Reasoning Models Don&#8217;t Always Say What They Think</em></a>. Anthropic&#8217;s Alignment Science Team tested whether chain‑of‑thought (CoT) explanations faithfully reflect LLM reasoning. They prompted state‑of‑the‑art reasoning models with hints and measure whether the models verbalize those hints in their CoT outputs. Across six hint types, the models reveal used hints less than 20% of the time and often below 1%. Outcome‑based reinforcement learning initially improved faithfulness but plateaued. The authors conclude that while CoT monitoring can flag misbehaviors, it cannot reliably guarantee alignment because models can conceal or omit critical reasoning steps. </li>
<li><a href="https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2025/01/21/llm-judge-decision-tree"><em>Classic ML to Cope with Dumb LLM Judges</em></a>. Doug Turnbull shows that one way to improve the reliability of noisy LLM judges is to treat their outputs as features for a simple machine‑learning classifier. He collects thousands of pairwise relevance judgments from local &#8220;dumb&#8221; LLMs, varying prompts to force choices or allow &#8220;neither,&#8221; and then trains a decision‑tree classifier that learns to match human preferences. The ensemble is surprisingly effective: certain combinations of attribute‑specific LLM judgments achieve over 90% precision on a subset of data. Turnbull cautions that this is just a lab notebook result&#160;&#8212;&#160;classic ML helps aggregate LLM votes, but cross‑validation and reproducibility remain challenges.</li>
<li><a href="https://verdik.substack.com/p/how-to-get-consistent-classification"><em>How to Get Consistent Classification From Inconsistent LLMs?</em></a>. Verdi Kapuku outlines a method to tame the noisy label outputs of large language models by embedding each label into a vector space and merging semantically similar ones via cosine‑similarity search and disjoint‑set union clustering. He notes that LLMs often produce lexicographically different but semantically identical labels, so his approach uses an embedding model and a high‑similarity threshold to map new labels back to the canonical cluster. Verdi cautions that clustering can over‑generalize truly novel concepts and that results depend heavily on the quality of the embedding model, but he argues the technique offers a scalable route to deterministic labeling. </li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910"><em>Large Language Models Are Human‑Level Prompt Engineers</em></a>. Researchers from the University of Toronto, the Vector Institute and the University of Waterloo introduce Automatic Prompt Engineer, a framework that treats prompt design as a program‑search problem. Their method uses one LLM to propose candidate instructions and another to evaluate them, iteratively refining prompts via Monte Carlo search to maximize a chosen score function. Across 24 instruction‑induction tasks and 21 Big‑Bench tasks, APE‑generated prompts outperform or match human‑written prompts. This work demonstrates that LLMs can run large prompt‑engineering &#8220;jobs&#8221; on themselves&#160;&#8212;&#160;generating, testing and selecting instructions&#160;&#8212;&#160;yet it also underscores the need for careful scoring functions and human oversight when deploying automatically generated prompts.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01839"><em>Sample, Scrutinize and Scale: Effective Inference-Time Search by Scaling Verification</em></a>. Traditionally, scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) has been achieved through two main methods: increasing model size and scaling training data. This paper introduces a third approach: scaling test-time computation via sampling-based search. This method involves generating multiple candidate responses during inference and selecting the best one through self-verification in a similar manner as <em>Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers</em>. By scaling up this sampling-based search, the authors demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning capabilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05120"><em>More Agents Is All You Need</em></a> &#160;&#8212;&#160; Tencent researchers show that simply sampling multiple outputs from a model and taking a majority vote&#160;&#8212;&#160;an approach they call Agent Forest&#160;&#8212;&#160;improves performance across reasoning and generation tasks. Their experiments reveal that accuracy scales with the number of agents and that ensembles of smaller LLMs can match or surpass larger models. The method is orthogonal to more complex chain‑of‑thought or debate frameworks and works as a plug‑in to enhance them. However, the authors note that gains are correlated with task difficulty and that brute‑force voting may require many runs, highlighting a trade‑off between compute cost and improved self‑evaluation.</li>
<li><a href="https://ghuntley.com/cursed/"><em>i ran Claude in a loop for three months, and it created a genz programming language called cursed</em></a>. Geoffrey Huntley recounts an experiment where he prompted Anthropic&#8217;s Claude model to &#8220;build a Gen‑Z version of Go&#8221; and then let it run in a while‑true loop for three months. Without external tool integrations, Claude produced a complete compiler, lexical specification and even editor plug‑ins for a language called cursed. The language replaces Go keywords with slang (&#8220;ready&#8221; for if, &#8220;slay&#8221; for func, etc.) and can compile programs via LLVM. Huntley presents this as both an entertaining demonstration of agentic persistence and a cautionary tale: even a single prompt can lead an LLM to generate vast, unpredictable artifacts when allowed to self‑iterate.</li>

Security researcher Sean Heelan recounts how he used OpenAI&#8217;s o3 model to audit the ksmbd server. After feeding o3 carefully selected slices of the SMB3 codebase, he asked it to reason about concurrent session handling and discovered a use‑after‑free bug that became CVE‑2025‑37899. Heelan notes that o3 could spot subtle concurrency issues that required reasoning about object lifetimes. He frames this as a milestone: LLMs are now powerful enough to augment expert vulnerability research, but context‑window limits mean humans must still curate code slices and verify results.</li>

Thomas Gaines and Amanda Mercier discuss the application of principles for building human teams to building trust in human-machine hybrid teams.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03453"><em>On Large Language Models in National Security Applications</em></a>. William Caballero and Phillip Jenkins from the Air Force Institute of Technology discuss opportunities for artificial intelligence integration into the national security establishment.</li>
<li><a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/advantage-defense-artificial-intelligence-at-the-tactical-cyber-edge/"><em>Advantage Defense: Artificial Intelligence at the Tactical Cyber Edge</em></a>. I wrote this article for the Modern War Institute at West Point to highlight early opportunities for artificial intelligence in military cyber applications: to accelerate the development of machine learning models to deal with ever-increasing amounts of data; as an analyst support tool to accelerate the pace of analysis; to improve warning intelligence; and to create realistic training.</li>
<li><a href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/07/friction-fog-and-failure-in-a-software-defined-force/"><em>Friction, Fog, and Failure in a Software-Defined Force</em></a>. Anthony Quitugua explains the risks of a brittle, connected modern military. Although not explicitly related to artificial intelligence, this perspective ought to inform all discussions of applying artificial intelligence in the military.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison"><em>A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size</em></a>. Researchers at Anthropic, the UK&#8217;s AI Safety Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute demonstrate that as few as 250 documents can poison large language models. As AI becomes more integrated in military use cases, this will become an area of increasing importance.</li>

    <li><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/resobscura/p/ai-makes-the-humanities-more-important">AI Makes the Humanities More Important</a>. Benjamin Breen argues that generative AI doesn&#8217;t sideline the humanities so much as it elevates their core strengths&#160;&#8212;&#160;judgment, curation, source criticism, and methodological rigor&#160;&#8212;&#160;while making the landscape &#8220;weirder.&#8221; He urges instructors to lean into assignments that emphasize primary-source analysis, argumentative writing, and historical method, the parts AI struggles to fake convincingly, and to teach students how to interrogate AI outputs as artifacts with provenance, bias, and error modes rather than as oracles. </li>
<li><a href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/peering-into-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-military-classroom/">Peering into the Future of Artificial Intelligence in the Military Classroom</a>. James Lacey from the Marine Corps War College contends that professional military education should move beyond bans and bolt-ons to deliberately redesign curricula and assessment around AI-enabled learning. He recommends shifting from take-home essays to in-class defenses, wargaming, and problem-solving that require human reasoning; investing in faculty upskilling and institutional AI tooling; and building clear policies that both leverage AI as a co-pilot and preserve academic integrity.</li>
<li><a href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/10/a-guide-to-collaborating-with-and-not-surrendering-to-ai-in-the-military-classroom/">A Guide to Collaborating With&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Not Surrendering to&#160;&#8212;&#160;AI in the Military Classroom</a>. Matthew Woessner from the National Defense University) advocates a &#8220;collaborate, don&#8217;t capitulate&#8221; approach to AI in the classroom. He emphasizes cultivating skepticism about AI outputs, and ensuring that human judgment&#160;&#8212;&#160;not the tool&#160;&#8212;&#160;remains the center of learning.</li>
