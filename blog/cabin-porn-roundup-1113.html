<p>Starting with November month, I have decided to take a different approach to posting links to cabins I find inspiring, attractive, or otherwise worthy of note: rather than make an individual post each time I come upon such a structure, from here on out I will hold them for the end of the month when I can collect my favorite posts and pictures. This will not only reduce the volume of &#8220;Wow.&#8221; and &#8220;Beautiful.&#8221; one-word link posts I have made a habit of publishing since discovering the Cabin Porn Tumblr last year, but will also allow me to centralize these relevant thoughts into a single monthly post.</p>

<p>On November third, Cory Weidenbach posted a picture of a &#8220;<a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/65890726507/massive-treefort-in-the-catskills-of-new-york">massive treefort in the Catskills of New York</a>.&#8221; Growing up I would have <em>loved</em> a house like this. Honestly though, who am I kidding&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would still love to have a house like this.</p>

<p>On the topic of tree houses, I also really liked this one in <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/66276868941/treehouse-in-swanzey-new-hampshire-contributed">Swanzey, New Hampshire</a>. Much higher off the ground and slightly more modestly built, this would be more my style. Not that I would complain either way though, mind you.</p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn.html">Since I discovered</a> almost a year ago now it has shown me some amazing videos, like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/13641808772/this-must-be-the-place-by-lost-found-films-50"><em>This Must Be The Place</em></a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/48864768"><em>The Smokehouse</em></a>. On November twentieth the site&#8217;s editors once again found another great video, this time about a <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/67562876517/meet-jay-nelson-professional-fort-builder-on-the">professional fort builder</a>. I love these videos.</p>

<p>And finally, towards the end of November an <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/68058008660/ice-house-near-lake-placid-ny-contributed-by">ice house near Lake Placid, NY</a> popped up, and despite not technically a cabin I couldn&#8217;t help but include it here. I have always wanted to visit upstate New York to see this sort of beautiful natural scenery in a place only known for its bustling cities. Perhaps someday on my way to Maine.</p>

<p>Although I failed to post this on December 1st as I had originally planned, I see it as a way to leave room for improvement next month.</p>
