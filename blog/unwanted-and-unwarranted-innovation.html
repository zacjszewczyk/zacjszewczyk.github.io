The author is hypothesizing that a generation raised on touch screens and iTunes is unlikely to use the internet in the same way it is used now, which will eventually bring about a revolution of sorts in which the computing world and the internet in particular centers around specific apps rather than the browser.

Rather than a certainty though--the idea that the world of technology and the internet in particular are destined to change dramatically in the near future--I think we need to ask ourselves these questions: what is the possibility of reaching an asymptote in the near future at which point the need for innovation ceases? Before you answer, consider another: does anyone really want a phone the size of a bluetooth dongle--a Siri phone? does anymore *really* want a computer inside their head? Perhaps ranging into the dystopian extreme with the latter scenario, the thought nevertheless begs the question, &#8243;Is there a point at which we will have innovated *enough* that further innovation and future disruption is not only unwanted but also--and most importantly--unwarranted?&#8243;">
