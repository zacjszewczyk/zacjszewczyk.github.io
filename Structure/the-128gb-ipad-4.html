    <p>Having <a href="/blog/cabin-porn">just</a> <a href="/blog/the-patron-saint-of-cabin-porn">finished</a> <a href="/blog/glass-lodge">going</a> <a href="/blog/another-cabin-porn-update">through</a> <a href="/blog/sharecropper&amp;#8217;s-cabin">every</a> <a href="/blog/yukon-territory">article</a> <a href="/blog/this-must-be-the-place">posted</a> to Cabin Porn over the last four years, I thought it would be appropriate to take a step back, shift gears quickly, and write some observations about a rumor that has quickly gained a lot of traction over the past few hours. I am, of course, referring to the rumor of a 128GB iPad 4. As I thought more and more about it though, as I read <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/01/27/apple-ready-to-release-additional-ipad-model-likely-128gb-version/">9to5 Mac&#8217;s coverage of the rumor</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/28/gurman-128">John Gruber&#8217;s take</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3926532/5th-generation-ipad-part-potentially-revealed-in-leaked-image">potential substantiation by The Verge shortly thereafter</a>, and as I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/52357425">A day in the life from Whole Larder Love</a>, the realization that the iPad 4 rumor was not what I wanted to write about slowly dawned on me. I suppose in order to give that epiphany any degree of substance I should provide some background.</p>
    
    <p>I have been writing about one form of technology or another ever since I can remember. My first website, in fact, which I refuse to link every time I reference it out of a mixture of embarrassment and wonder that sometime so contrived could have ever been published to the internet, was about making websites. Ever since that first blog, I have written about technology with a particular focus on computers. Only recently, with the launch of this site, did I enter in to the reporting space, viewing it as the next logical step in my career as a blogger. The last few weeks, however, have seen my interests begin to shift. The culmination of this shift, I thought, was the number of posts I made over the past two days. Turns out&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>turns out</em>, as Marco is so fond of saying&#160;&#8212;&#160;I was wrong: the culmination was not the series of posts and articles about cabins, but instead my choice not to write about the 128GB iPad 4 rumor.</p>
    
    <p>So if you&#8217;re still here for that you might as well leave: I have nothing to say. Nothing to say about that anyways.</p>
    
    <p>I suppose this transition was a long time coming, now that I think about it. For quite some time I have been fascinated with initiatives like YouTube Friday from Shawn Blanc, the most recent installment of which, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/01/those-who-make/">Those Who Make</a>, has continued to fascinate me for nearly a week with thought-provoking videos from&#160;&#8212;&#160;you guessed it&#160;&#8212;&#160;those who make things. Similarly, Ben Brooks&#8217;s departure from the tech reporting norm expected of Apple bloggers and successful venture into product reviews such as <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/knife-follow-up/">his excellent knife analysis</a> also captured my attention, as did Marco&#8217;s entrance into this space as well. <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/">Tools &#38; Toys</a>, a gadget and software review site Shawn Blanc runs, is the most recent example of this. All these ventures have one thing in particular in common: they are all a departure from the traditional, from &#8220;the tech reporting norm expected of Apple bloggers&#8221;.</p>
    
    <p>I want to join Shawn, Ben, and Marco. I don&#8217;t want to be the next John Gruber with my linked list and succinct, witty quips. Not that there&#8217;s anything bad with that approach, that&#8217;s just not what I want from this website. No, I want this website to be something different, something out of the ordinary. I don&#8217;t want this website to be just another linkblog, pushing out post after post with my nuance opinion on an over-analyzed topic, merely parroting the thoughts and ideas of the bloggers I follow and admire. I want this blog to be an outlier, the one that bucks the trend; something extraordinary.</p>
    
    <p><em>Keep in mind that I wrote this post last night before Apple officially announced the 128GB iPad 4. At that time it was still an unsubstantiated rumor.</em></p>
