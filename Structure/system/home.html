<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    My name is Zachary Szewczyk. I graduated in 2018 from Youngstown State University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. That same day, after four years in the ROTC program, I commissioned into the United States Army's Cyber Corps as a Second Lieutenant.
</p>
<p>
    I adventure as much as possible, write sometimes, and code often. I spend most of my time working as an Army Cyber Operations Officer, and finish every day with a few hours in the gym. Although my knack for leadership and my technical expertise has helped me excel in my profession, my passion lies in the great outdoors, and in the writer's craft. Someday I hope to turn those into a full-time lifestyle.
