        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Zachary Szewczyk. I graduated in 2018 from Youngstown State University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. That same day, after four years in the ROTC program, I commissioned into the United States Army's Cyber Corps as a Second Lieutenant.

            I have enjoyed the great outdoors since before I can remember, written here and elsewhere off and on since 2006, and developed my own coding projects since 2004. Although my knack for programming has helped me excel in my profession, my passion lies in the great outdoors, and in the writer's craft. Someday I hope to turn that passion into a full-time lifestyle. <!--You can find more information about my credentials and the services I offer on the <a href="/ncustomers">new customers</a> page, so visit that one if it sounds like I might be able to help you out.
