    <p>"This is almost exactly <a href="/blog/the-8-bit-nintendo-phone">what I imagined the Nintendo phone would look like</a>&#8221;, I thought when I came across the <a href="http://jolla.com">Jolla</a> phone this morning in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/finnish-meego-startup-jolla-reveals-first-phone-hardware-with-customisable-shells-e399-price-tag-coming-at-years-end/">a Tech Crunch article</a>. The same principles that inspired my &#8220;8-Bit Nintendo Phone&#8221; appeared to have driven the creators of the Jolla phone to design a product innovative in both its hardware and software alike. Unfortunately, this phone will not come to America for quite some time; however, based on the information available at the company&#8217;s home page, I formulated a few admittedly premature thoughts on this topic.</p>
    
    <p>The first and single most advertised aspect of the Jolla phone is &#8220;the Other Half&#8221;, seemingly a glorified skin. Its simplicity, however, belies its true potential: &#8220;the Other Half"&#160;&#8212;&#160;heretofore referred to as simply &#8220;the case"&#160;&#8212;&#160;not only personalizes the phone&#8217;s exterior, but its interior as well. With each case the operating system&#8217;s color scheme changes to present a single, unified color pallet. In other words, an orange case means an orange operating system. The power of &#8220;the Other Half&#8221; is not limited to mere color schemes though: individual applications and data can be linked to each case, essentially creating a multi-user device where the cases are the username and password to each account. This hardware/software pairing, where a piece of hardware so significantly impacts the software experience, from the apps available to the system&#8217;s color scheme, is fascinating to me and perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Jolla phone.</p>
    
    <p>Perhaps just as interesting though is Jolla as a company and Jolla the phone as an idea, and what the pair means to the smartphone industry. In the current Apple-Samsung duopoly, the entrance of a third player, albeit a small one, is interesting in and of itself. Combined with the innovative product that company is attempting to bring to the market though, that&#8217;s when things get interesting.</p>
    
    <p>I&#8217;m less hopeful for Jolla&#8217;s prospects than I would be if it were Nintendo&#160;&#8212;&#160;especially Nintendo&#160;&#8212;&#160;bringing this phone to market, of that much I am sure. That&#8217;s not to say a small company can&#8217;t make some waves though, and that&#8217;s not to say Jolla can&#8217;t experience some level of success. After all, once upon a time Apple was a small company too. Jolla&#8217;s staff could take a lesson from Apple in at least one respect though: announcing the Jolla phone more than half a year before its launch date, Natasha Lomas of Tech Crunch made a good point in questioning whether or not the company would be able to sustain interest in their product. As enthusiastic as I am about the interesting innovations this phone is bringing to market, I can&#8217;t say even I will remember to check back in seven months.</p>
