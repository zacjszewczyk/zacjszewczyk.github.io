<h1 id="writingProjects">Writing Projects</h1>
<p>
    I have written here and elsewhere off and on since 2006. College almost destroyed my love for writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;as it did my love for reading, for a while&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I still managed to churn out a few things here and there. It took a while to get back into it once I graduated, but now I split my writing time between two projects: this site, and my book.
</p>
<h3>This Site</h3>
<p>
    I started this website in 2012. After finding the day's popular blogging platforms wanting, I decided to create something of my own. I talk about First Crack, the content management system behind this website, below.
</p>
<p>
    Each incarnation of this website has focused on something different. Web design at first, then robotics, technology for a time, and then everything except technology as my passion for blogging faded. Now I talk about whatever I want, adventuring, writing, weightlifting, and leadership primary amongst them. I enjoy the writer's craft as an intense creative outlet, and hope to someday focus all my energy there.
</p>
<h3>My Book</h3>
<p>
    Freshman year of college, I decided to write a book; thirty months later, I finished the last round of revisions on a 50,000 word text that I hope to someday publish. I have little interest in sharing more details about this project until then.
</p>
<hr style='margin:50px auto;width:50%;border:0;border-bottom:1px dashed #ccc;background:#999;' />
<h1 id="codingProjects">Coding Projects</h1>
<p>
    I started programming in 2004. Small websites, at the time, and then more complex projects as I got better at it. Today, I split the time I spend programming between coding projects and web development. The first means content management systems for the most part. Although at times I have focused on other things, like a news scraper that predicted the best time to submit a link to Y Combinator's popular social news site, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, I had little incentive to develop those applications past the preliminary stages.
</p>
<p>
    My second main focus, web design, came about as a complement to my work on content management systems. I have yet to come across anyone wanting a back-end without the front-end, user-facing website to go along with it, so I like to roll the two into one package. Below I talk about some of my personal projects, with links to code repositories where applicable.  
</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">First Crack</a></h2>
<p>
    Having tried several of 2012's most popular content management systems, I arrived at the realization that nothing could meet my needs as well as something I built myself. After a few months of work, I began running my website on something I called First Crack. Inspired by Marco Arment's Second Crack as described on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18">episode eighteen of Build &amp; Analyze</a>, my system grew over the years but has remained true to its core throughout its development. Given a directory of articles formatted in Markdown and saved as plain text files, First Crack will generate a static website of over a thousand pages in less than two seconds. I have written about this application <a href="/blog/First-Crack-10">in the past</a>, so I will leave those articles and <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">the project's GitHub page</a> to do the rest of my explaining. This project is, as of now, inactive, although I hope to one day start publishing the source code again. I continue to run my site on this engine today. 
</p>
<h2>HN Scraper</h2>
<p>
    My obsession with Hacker News began when I woke up to see that one of my articles had attracted over fourteen thousand pageviews in twenty-four hours. After some digging, I discovered that&#160;&#8212;&#160;unbeknown to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of my readers had submitted the post to Y Combinator's social news aggregator and it had made its way to the front page. After failing to replicate that success, I started looking for ways to optimize the process by which I sought to bring my writings to the site's visitors' attention. If I could find a way to measure the site's activity without having access to its analytics, and if I could find a way to gauge the rate at which new submissions were gaining traction in particular, I figured I could predict the best times to make my submissions with the goal of attracting the most visitors possible. Other websites, like the now-defunct <a href="http://hnpickup.appspot.com">HN Pickup</a> and the more recent <a href="http://hnnotify.leknarf.net">HN Notify</a> had already proved the concept, I just needed to replicate the results.    
</p>
<p>
    Gathering the raw data proved much easier than I had anticipated, but I hit a stumbling block when it came to making sense of all that information. I took a few runs at it, but to no avail. Soon after that, I shifted my attention elsewhere. I have not put enough work into the code to warrant its own GitHub repository, so I have nothing to show for my work yet. I decided to write about this project here in spite of that, though, hoping that doing so would spark enough interest to get development back on track. Although I have had some success with this project, it, too, is inactive.
</p>
<h2><a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/fmtv-rv-builder/">FMTV RV Builder</a></h2>
<p>
    I decided to buy a Toyota 4Runner in 2017, after <a href="https://www.xoverland.com/">Expedition Overland</a> turned me on to the vehicle with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEacEr4cZy-5c3N7NUHb2dE1ffGv53H73">their overland series to Alaska</a>. I started eying <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BomdKEQn93H/">an adventure van</a> in 2018, but stumbled across <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlLoN1ZHKmg/">FMTV-based RV's</a> a few months later and decided to go that route. A mountain of time, effort, and technical expertise went into the actual build, but before that could even start, the planning process alone took a lot of time, effort, and technical expertise. I got lucky in that I had enough of all three to make this project successful, but not everyone will. My goal with this project is to create a simple, web-based tool that interested adventurers can use to make this long journey just a little bit easier.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to write a long and detailed series on the events leading up to my decision to start this project, so look for that in the near future. I cannot wait to get that ball rolling. Until then, feel free to play around with this project. Check out its repository <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/fmtv-rv-builder/src/master/">on BitBucket</a>, and see a live demo hosted here <a href="/MTV" target="_blank">on this site</a>.

<h1 id="caddProjects">CADD Projects</h1>
<p>
    In late 2015, I started getting very interested in 3D modeling. I had done some Computer Aided Drafting and Design, or CADD, as part of a <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Team</a> a few years prior, but spent most of my time manufacturing the parts my much more capable friend created. I got back into it to design&#160;&#8212;&#160;of all things&#160;&#8212;&#160;houses. Industry programs like Solidworks and AutoCAD have a much steeper learning curve than I was willing to endure at the time, so I started with SketchUp. Since then I have built many houses, created several variations of the RV mentioned above, and even dabbled in tiny homes. I enjoy the process, and have become quite good at it. For the times when I don't feel like writing or coding, this has become a nice outlet. You can find all of my models on <a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/user/ue3900eb8-8f91-478f-82b5-fada60765209/Zac-S?nav=models">the SketchUp 3D Warehouse.</a> Below I highlight some of my favorites.
</p>
<h2>The Homestead</h3>
<p>
    I wanted to create a house built for a homestead. Seven mediocre attempts later, I happened across a post from <a href="http://www.buildingbeyelerhollow.com/">the Beyeler family</a> on Pinterest. I loved everything about their design, and so I started building my own version of it. My dream home sits at two stories, several thousand square feet, and features a three car garage, main level master bedroom, walk-out basement, and four upstairs bedrooms. I hope to someday have the resources and the need for such a house.
</p>

<p>
    I hope to one day build this on a large, open plot of land, surrounded by trees on all sides, with a pond in the front and plenty of space for a large garden and a greenhouse in the back.
