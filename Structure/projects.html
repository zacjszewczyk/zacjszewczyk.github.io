    I split the time I spend programming between coding projects and web development. The first means content management systems for the most part. Although at times I have focused on other things, like a news scraper that predicted the best time to submit a link to Y Combinator's popular social news site, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, I had little incentive to develop those applications past the preliminary stages.
</p>
<p>
    My second main focus, web design, came about as a complement to my work on content management systems. I have yet to come across a single client wanting a back-end without the front-end, user-facing website to go along with it, so I often roll the two into one package. Below I talk about some of my personal projects, with links to code repositories where possible.  

<h1>Coding Projects</h1>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">First Crack</a></h2>
<p>
    Having tried several of 2012's most popular content management systems, I arrived at the realization that nothing could meet my needs as well as something I built myself. After a few months of work, I began running my website on something I called First Crack. Inspired by Marco Arment's Second Crack as described on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18">episode eighteen of Build &amp; Analyze</a>, my system grew over the years but has remained true to its core throughout its development. Given a directory of articles formatted in Markdown and saved as plain text files, First Crack will generate a static website of over a thousand pages in less than two seconds. I have written about this application <a href="/blog/First-Crack-10">in the past</a>, so I will leave those articles and <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">the project's GitHub page</a> to do the rest of my explaining. This project is, as of now, inactive, although I hope to one day start publishing the source code again. I continue to run my site on this engine today.

<h2>HN Scraper</h2>
<p>
    My obsession with Hacker News began when I woke up to see that one of my articles had attracted over fourteen thousand pageviews in twenty-four hours. After some digging, I discovered that--unbeknown to me--one of my readers had submitted the post to Y Combinator's social news aggregator and it had made its way to the front page. After failing to replicate that success, I started looking for ways to optimize the process by which I sought to bring my writings to the site's visitors' attention. If I could find a way to measure the site's activity without having access to its analytics, and if I could find a way to gauge the rate at which new submissions were gaining traction in particular, I figured I could predict the best times to make my submissions with the goal of attracting the most visitors possible. Other websites, like the now-defunct <a href="http://hnpickup.appspot.com">HN Pickup</a> and the more recent <a href="http://hnnotify.leknarf.net">HN Notify</a> had already proved the concept, I just needed to replicate the results.    
</p>
<p>
    Gathering the raw data proved much easier than I had anticipated, but I hit a stumbling block when it came to making sense of all that information. I took a few runs at it, but to no avail. Soon after that, I shifted my attention elsewhere. I have not put enough work into the code to warrant its own GitHub repository, so I have nothing to show for my work yet. I decided to write about this project here in spite of that, though, hoping that doing so would spark enough interest to get development back on track. Although I have had some success with this project, it, too, is inactive.

<h2><a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/fmtv-rv-builder/">FMTV RV Builder</a></h2>
<p>
    I decided to buy a Toyota 4Runner in 2017, after <a href="https://www.xoverland.com/">Expedition Overland</a> turned me on to the vehicle with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEacEr4cZy-5c3N7NUHb2dE1ffGv53H73">their overland series to Alaska</a>. I started eying <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BomdKEQn93H/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">an adventure van</a> in 2018, but stumbled across <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlLoN1ZHKmg/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">FMTV-based RV's</a> a few months later and decided to go that route. A mountain of time, effort, and technical expertise went into the actual build, but before that could even start, the planning process alone took a lot of time, effort, and technical expertise. I got lucky in that I had enough of all three to make this project successful, but not everyone will. My goal with this project is to create a simple, web-based tool that interested adventurers can use to make this long journey just a little bit easier.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to write a long and detailed series on the events leading up to my decision to start this project, so look for that in the near future. I cannot wait to get that ball rolling. Until then, feel free to play around with this project. Check out its repository <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/fmtv-rv-builder/src/master/">on BitBucket</a>, and see a live demo hosted here <a href="/MTV" target="_blank">on this site</a>.
