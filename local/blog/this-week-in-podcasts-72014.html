<p>This week, thanks to Carl Holscher and Daniel Ignacio, I have discovered two great new podcasts. Alongside these two shows, I once again present my list of the best podcasts I have had the privilege to hear over the past seven days. These are the best of the best, folks, and as such I hope you will spend some time checkout out each and every one of them. I promise: it will be worth your time.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/11/19/67-what-does-a-grown-man-look-like-naked-scott-simpson">Unprofessional Episode 67: What Does a Grown Man Look Like Naked &#160;&#8212;&#160; Scott Simpson</a>. Airborne turbulence, damaging accusations, awkward situations at your kid&#8217;s birthday party, and what to do when you think your plane might crash. As is the case with almost every podcast Scott Simpson makes an appearance on, this was both <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/smart-and-funny.html">smart and quite funny</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/12/3/69-anastasia-helicopter-merlin-mann">Unprofessional Episode 69: Anastasia Helicopter &#160;&#8212;&#160; Merlin Mann</a>. Turns out names are hard, and words are even harder: in this week&#8217;s episode of Unprofessional, Dave, Lex, and Merlin pillory the terrible choices so many make in naming their children.</p>

<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/75">Accidental Tech Podcast Episode 75: You Had Your Moment</a>. Turns out John hates amusement parks. This week&#8217;s intro right here is 3:25 of John Siracusa at his best; absolutely hilarious. Also on this episode, the importance of self-relience when insuring the longevity of your creations, more Overcast follow-up, and some additional speculation as to the material of the purported iPhone 6 screen that leaked some two weeks ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-010-clap-on-three/">Exponent Episode 10: Clap on Three</a>. Ben and James talk once again on economics and Uber, a topic I found fascinating <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/this-week-in-podcasts-6714.html">last time they went over it</a>, and have another great discussion about culture as it relates to Microsoft and the company&#8217;s future. Unsurprisingly, a very interesting episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zombiepodcast.com">We&#8217;re Alive</a>. After a <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/491710615359348736">desperate plea for suggestions</a>, Carl Holscher pointed me towards this podcast. Although I tend to dislike the zombie genre, I decided to give it a try; fifteen chapters over some forty-eight episodes later, and I&#8217;m hooked: We&#8217;re Alive is a fantastic radio drama the likes of which I have never heard before. I will admit that at times the producers get a little too ambitious and have too many things going on at once, making it difficult to discern exactly what is going on, but all in all this is a great show and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a break from the norm.</p>

<p><a href="http://recess.unitedpixelworkers.com">Pixel Recess</a>. Another newcomer, this time <a href="https://twitter.com/dotdapple/status/492406515349729280">courtesy of Daniel Ignacio</a>, he described Pixel Recess as &#8220;a more design-y version of Bionic&#8221;. A huge fan of Bionic myself, I will admit that I was skeptical: I did not believe anyone could reproduce something so perfect on so many different levels as Bionic was, and as it turns out, I was right. However, that&#8217;s not to say that Pixel Recess is not a hilarious show, because it absolutely is: these have to be the best interviews I have ever heard. Completely absurd and always funny&#160;&#8212;&#160;in that respect, it is very much a close sibbling to Bionic.</p>
