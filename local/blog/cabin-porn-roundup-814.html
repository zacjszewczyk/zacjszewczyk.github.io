<p>This is a continuation of my ongoing Cabin Porn Roundup series, where I collect interesting pictures of cabins and cool stories about the outdoors from across the world and present them in a single location. Much like my &#8220;This Week in Podcasts&#8221; series, I feature only the best of the best here. Enjoy.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Riverside-a-frame-Alaska.jpg' alt='Riverside a-frame in Seward, Alaska.' title='Riverside a-frame in Seward, Alaska.' /></div>

<p>Whenever anyone talks about Alaska, it conjures mental images of barren snowscapes akin to those of the Antarctic Tundra. However, although certain seasons do cause such environments to spring forth, characterizing the entire state as such is no more accurate than assuming all of Nevada is dessert: in reality, Alaska gets more seasons than oft-lauded southern states like Florida. Further, interestingly, although many are quick to dismiss Alaska as a credible option for any but rugged outdoorsmen, I have never heard anything but high praise for the state from everyone who has ever actually visited it, and even greater accolades from those who live there. Compare that with states like the aforementioned Florida of which many refer to as a nice place to visit but no place to live, and we find ourselves with an interesting dichotomy: what alienates the former while endearing the latter to the masses, yet leads to this disparity in real world experience? I cannot say for sure, having only lived in one of the two states, but I would love to spend some time in Alaska to find out, especially if I could stay in a neat cabin like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/93502069692/riverside-a-frame-in-seward-alaska-contributed">this a-frame in Seward</a>.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Treehouse-in-Turkey.jpg' alt='Tree house in the mountains of Turkey.' title='Tree house in the mountains of Turkey.' /></div>

<p>I have wanted for a tree house ever since I can remember, and <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/93877892951/tree house-in-the-mountains-near-eskisehir-turkey">this one situated in the mountains of Turkey</a>, with an incredible view of a valley below, certainly has not made the fact that I do not have one any easier to bear. Beautiful&#160;&#8212;&#160;both the tree house and its view.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Ion-Hotel-Iceland.jpg' alt='Ion Hotel Iceland.' title='Ion Hotel Iceland.' /></div>

<p>It&#8217;s no cabin, that&#8217;s for sure, but I just couldn&#8217;t resist including <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/escapes/base-camp/A-Sleek-Escape-Amongst-Icelands-Rough-Edges.html">this beautiful Icelandic structure</a> in this week&#8217;s roundup. Surrounded by lava fields, geysers, and streams, this hotel&#8217;s setting combines uniquely with the comforts of an upscale lodge to provide an attractive tandem offering for both ends of the spectrum. After a day out in the field, I can&#8217;t think of a place I would rather stay.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/A-frame-poso-park.jpg' alt='A-frame in Poso Park' title='A-frame in Poso Park.' /></div>

<p>The more time I spend putting together these lists, the more often it seems I end up linking to cabins in California. Having done quite well at making a name for itself as a remarkably liberal state known largely for its large population centers, every time I see &#8220;California&#8221; tacked on at the end of a description, it surprises me. Pleasantly, I ought to add: its great to see that even in the most unlikely of places, beautiful natural getaways such as <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94069281645/a-frame-in-poso-park-sequoia-national-forest">this A-frame in Posey, California</a>, still exist.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Treehouse-paradise-columbia-river-valley.jpg' alt='The burgeoning tree house paradise in the Columbia River Valley, WA.' title='The burgeoning tree house paradise in the Columbia River Valley, WA.' /></div>

<p>Back to the topic of tree houses, Foster Huntington is building <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94357908310/the-burgeoning-treehouse-paradise-of-foster">an incredible one</a> in the Columbia River Valley of West Virgina. The picture above in no way does this impressive structure justice though, so I highly encourage you to check out his picture blog for the project over at <a href="http://thecindercone.com">The Cinder Cone</a> and read his story at <a href="http://www.arestlesstransplant.com/the-cinder-cone/">A Restless Transplant</a>. Words cannot convey just how impressed and jealous I am of him right now. Amazing.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Cabin-on-Luchon-peak.jpg' alt='Cabin on Luchon peak, French Pyrenees.' title='Cabin on Luchon peak, French Pyrenees.' /></div>

<p>Amazing setting: <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94557476225/cabin-on-luchon-peak-french-pyrenees">this small red cabin</a>, perched atop the Luchon Peak in the French Pyrenees, looks minuscule when framed against the massive mountain behind it. Great picture.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Shelter-in-Norway.jpg' alt='Shelter in Sandhornoy, Norway.' title='Shelter in Sandhornoy, Norway.' /></div>

<p>If nothing else, <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/94727504130/shelter-in-sandhornoy-norway-created-by-students">this shelter in Sandhornoy, Norway</a>, created by students for the SALT festival, is interesting to look at. Beyond that, though, I&#8217;m not quite sure what to think. If forced to give an opinion though, I would say its creators pursued the notion of modern architecture much too far here in choosing form over function to the extreme.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Mount-Brown-Hut-in-Westland.jpg' alt='Mt. Brown Hut in Westland, New Zealand' title='Mt. Brown Hut in Westland, New Zealand' /></div>

<p>If it has not become readily apparent yet, I have a thing for mountains: the only thing I love more than a towering, monolithic mountain range is the view they afford from their top; it&#8217;s both spectacular and frustratingly indescribable. So although there is nothing particularly noteworthy about <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/95100486799/mt-brown-hut-in-westland-new-zealand">this cabin atop Mount Brown in New Zealand</a>, perhaps with the exception of its color, the view behind it is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Freiburg-Germany.jpg' alt='Freiburg, Germany' title='Freiburg, Germany' /></div>

<p>Hat-tip to Sid O&#8217;Neill for <a href="https://twitter.com/sidoneill/status/501722823224991744">pointing this one out</a>, Unsplash posted a neat picture of <a href="http://unsplash.com/post/95144460349/download-by-stephy-pariande-marzian">a small cabin in Freiburg, Germany</a> that looks a lot like the tree house I wanted to build years ago, when I was a kid. Nothing too special, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be.</p>
