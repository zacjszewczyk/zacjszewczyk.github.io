    <p>Almost a week ago I did something I rarely do: I wrote an article out of frustration. I had pushed and pushed myself to not only write every day, but to publish something at least once a day as well. But some days, there just isn&#8217;t anything to write about; sometimes, I need more than a day to work through an idea; and some days, I just don&#8217;t feel like writing. Instead of a strong readership, I only had frustration to show for my efforts. <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/writer&amp;#8217;s-guilt.html"><em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em></a> was me saying that I had had enough: I was finished prolonging this never-ending sprint, constantly pushing myself to make and publish work I was not proud of. Then I decided to <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/shifting-gears.html">shift gears</a>, looking to a shift in focus to revitalize my writing. Almost a week later, I&#8217;m here to say it worked.</p>
    
    <p>Shortly after publishing <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/shifting-gears.html"><em>Shifting Gears</em></a>, I started writing again. After I wrote and published <em>Writer&#8217;s Guilt</em>, as I sat back in my chair and started to calm down, I realized it wasn&#8217;t the writer&#8217;s craft I hated after all, just the pressure to write. Without it even for such a short period of time, I began to feel the familiar itch to create something new; I wanted to write again, and so I did.</p>
    
    <p>For the next few hours, I wrote constantly: I made drafts, brainstormed possible topics almost as fast as I could toss them out, and began piecing together a new article I had wanted to write for quite some time. I spent a few hours that day and then every available moment until last night writing that article, and then I posted it earlier this evening, six days after its inception. Curiously titled <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/nickelodeon&amp;#8217;s-experiment.html"><em>Nickelodeon&#8217;s Experiment</em></a>, this is the first longform piece I have written in quite some time. In a way, I view it as my return to writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;to real writing, not the piddly linkblog &#8220;writing&#8221; all too common these days, but to real prose built word by word and honed to a document I feel happy to call my own.</p>
