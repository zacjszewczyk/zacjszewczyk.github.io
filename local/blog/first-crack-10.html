<p>Since starting this website nearly two years ago, I have written specifically about the engine that runs it exactly four times: in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-first-crack.html">Introducing First Crack</a>, I detailed my long journey to the realization that I needed to build something completely my own, from the ground up; later, I talked about some of my creation&#8217;s niceties in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-in-practice.html">First Crack in Practice</a>, before outlining the changes an innocuous redesign brought about in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/complete-overhaul.html">First Crack&#8217;s Complete Overhaul</a>. Finally, some eleven months later, I returned to once again briefly run down my latest updates in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">Changes to First Crack</a>. Since then, however, for the last six months, I have not said a peep. Today, that changes with the release of First Crack 1.0 to the public.</p>

<p>I could wax on for paragraphs extolling the virtues of this CMS over others, explaining why I built it and believe it superior to the alternatives, or talking about the neat, helpful features I tried to tuck in wherever I could. However, I have done that before, and I doubt anyone wants to read that once again any more than I want to write it all over again. So instead, I wrote out a short, five-item list of highlights I want everyone to walk away from this article with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fast. First Crack is, by any standard, remarkably fast: it can take a completely empty directory structure and build a fully-functioning website of 725 articles, along with a full-text RSS feed to boot, in less than 1.25 seconds. That&#8217;s pretty darn quick.</li>
<li>Simple. First Crack runs on the widely-available Python engine using only built-in libraries, and works with simple plain text files formatted in Markdown. This means that on a Mac, you can go from nothing to having a website in just slightly longer than it will take you to write your first article. First Crack also works on a PC thanks to the magic of Cygwin, although you will have to install Python as well; unfortunately, it does not come pre-installed on every computer.</li>
<li>Portable. Wherever you have access to Python, you can run First Crack. With some minor modifications, that even means iOS.</li>
<li>Customizable. At less than 700 lines of well-documented code, customizing First Crack to fit your needs will prove much easier than you might at first suspect. Even if you don&#8217;t write Python for a living, or just don&#8217;t feel as strong a kinship with the language as I do, you can still easily change the structure and presentation of your site thanks to the modular approach I took when building this. Instead of messing with XML or YAML configuration files, just add or remove elements from a simple HTML document whenever you want to change the structure of your site; and if you want to change the look and feel, go ahead and make the necessary modifications the the standalone CSS document. Easy.</li>
<li>Beautiful. By no means the furthest thing from my mind throughout the development process, I designed every aspect of First Crack&#160;&#8212;&#160;from the back-end code parsing the Markdown files to the front-end HTML documents&#160;&#8212;&#160;with an eye for the difficult balance between form and function. And although I could just be biased, I think I have struck it well, and doubly so on the user-facing side: First Crack generates an attractive, responsive site that will look beautifully simple regardless of you and your readers&#8217; chosen device. So whether it&#8217;s Federico Viticci viewing your site on his iPad or Marco Arment with his Mac Pro and massive DELL monitors, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.</li>
</ul>
<p>First Crack is not the simplest CMS on the market, but I did not create it with that goal in mind: I wrote First Crack intending it to serve as a simple, fast, and easy-to-use blogging engine I could run on anything from my iPhone to a server, and in that respect it has succeeded remarkably well. Nevertheless, I am not so naive to believe that it is perfect&#160;&#8212;&#160;but that&#8217;s the point: I have honed it to a degree where I believe it suitable for public release, and so I have decided to put it out today in the hopes that some of you will try it and then let me know where I have fallen short, what needs improved, and where I should take this in the future. So please, head over to Github and give it a shot: the only things you need are Python, a terminal window, and a willingness to give some script a kid from Ohio wrote in his spare time a try.</p>
