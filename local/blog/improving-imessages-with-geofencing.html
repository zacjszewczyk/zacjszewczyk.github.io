<p>The other day, as I drove home from work and practiced my dictation to the tune of Siri&#8217;s inept transcription abilities, I deftly tapped iMessages&#8217; &#8220;Send as Text Message&#8221; tooltip for what&#160;&#8212;&#160;given the number of text messages I send each month&#160;&#8212;&#160;must quite literally fall somewhere in the neighborhood of the millionth time. I tapped this button two or three times until, finally, my phone realized I wanted every outgoing message sent without the use of Apple&#8217;s clever and oh-so-convenient replacement. Then, as if to mock me, a few seconds later it switched back to sending everything as an iMessage. I just couldn&#8217;t win.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, and to a great degree recently, it seems, the utility of iMessage has become a hot-button issue for many in the tech press and its adjacent areas. In the experience of most, Apple&#8217;s text messaging replacement works like a charm: Jim Dalrymple often talks about having no issues with the service whatsoever. At the same time, however, a likely smaller but nevertheless disproportionally vocal faction&#160;&#8212;&#160;as is often the case on the internet&#160;&#8212;&#160;just can&#8217;t get the darn app to work with any semblance of consistency. As you may have guessed from the previous paragraph&#8217;s anecdote, I fall in the latter category: since my girlfriend got an iPhone and iMessage became a &#8220;viable&#8221; option, iMessage has stymied our efforts to remain connected and in touch with one another more times than I care to remember. And because she is by far and away the one person I talk to most through this medium, this unreliability has given iMessage such a bad name that I have all but sworn the app off and gone with a popular alternative like WhatsApp, for example, or another, similar service. The one thing that keeps me coming back, though, and simultaneously the greatest frustration I have nearly every single day, is the inconsistency: sometimes it works great, at other times it works well enough to pass muster, but it fails just often enough to imbue within me an incredible level of distrust I tend to reserve only for weathermen and technology analysts. To its credit, I must admit, at least it fails more consistently in certain situations than in others. If that sounds awkward and convoluted, that&#8217;s because everything about this is, and therein lies the root of my problem.</p>

<p>Of the near innumerable number of times iMessage fails me, it does so most often when either my girlfriend or I am away from home and thus away from a WiFi network. So long as both of us have a strong and stable WiFi connection, iMessage works reasonably well. Unfortunately though, WiFi is a luxury neither of us have for the majority of our days, which brings me back to the situation described at the top of this article where I battled with iMessage while on my way home earlier this week. &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; I asked myself. &#8220;How can I fix this?&#8221; Every time I leave home and my phone tries to intelligently send an iMessage, I end up locked in a loop of variable and possibly infinite length, just trying to tell my girlfriend &#8220;Hi&#8221;. Even before this thought had finished crossing my mind though, the solution hit me: geofenced iMessages.</p>

<p>Every problem I, and I would wager many others, too, have with iMessages comes down to a combination of the sender&#8217;s phone attempting to dispatch iMessages at inopportune times, and the recipient&#8217;s phone failing to inform the former&#8217;s device that all future messages should, in fact, get sent as text messages in order to ensure timely delivery. At least for me, those inopportune moments always occur when either I as the sender or my girlfriend as the recipient, or vise-versa, leave a certain location&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely, our respective homes. If only there was some way for me to say that I only wanted to allow my phone to send and receive iMessages within a certain radius of a given location, or only when connected to a WiFi network, every single one of my problems with this service would be immediately solved. Now, that&#8217;s not to say this is necessarily the best solution, nor even a good one. But all the iPhone users who read this, think of the times and places when iMessages has failed you; like me, I imagine there is at least a small degree of commonality between them, even if only a little. So while goefenced iMessages might not be the best or most elegant solution, it would solve all my problems, and I would bet every one of a great number of other people as well. And that&#8217;s what Apple is all about. really: solving problems and making technology approachable. Unfortunately, as it stands now, iMessages flies directly in the face of that driving goal.</p>
