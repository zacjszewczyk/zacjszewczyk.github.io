    <p>Prompted by an article Zach Epstein posted to BGR last Thursday titled <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/12/26/mac-pro-windows-diy-cost/"><em>Testing the &#8216;Apple tax': What would it cost to build a Windows version of the new Mac Pro?</em></a> I planned to link his piece as a smug counterpoint to all the people I know who like saying that they can build a more powerful machine for &#8220;1/3 the cost"<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of my overpriced Apple computer. As I thought more about the notion of an Apple tax though, I realized I had more to say on this topic than a juvenile &#8220;ha ha&#8221;.</p>
    
    <p>Last week I visited a long-time friend of mine while on Christmas vacation. Before I <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/diary-of-a-convert.html">bought a new Retina MacBook Pro</a>, he and I had counted ourselves amongst the strongest of PC fanatics: throughout the entirety of our short lives on this earth we had both never owned a machine without the DELL logo emblazoned upon the lid, and would not even consider owning something so ridiculous as a Mac. We wanted to do real work, after all, and as well all know work does not get done on anything sporting a bitten apple. Ready for a new computer before college though, hesitant to adopt Windows 8&#8217;s problematic paradigms, and curious as to how the other half lived, I changed my mind, took a leap of faith, and bought a Mac. Sitting in my friend&#8217;s room last week having neglected to share this now month-old news with him, I searched for words to justify my change of heart. To my surprise, I found them in the very reasons we loved to hate Apple&#8217;s products.</p>
    
    <p>We got on to the topic of computers, as we invariably do, while waiting for his laptop to open the CADD program Inventor. Since last I saw him he and another friend had built a 3D printer, so given his ability create a functioning digital model of nearly any conceivable object we set out to create a Lego part yearned for in our years as FIRST Lego League participants: a peg bushing. Those familiar with the world of Lego robotics will immediately grasp the rationale of such a piece, just like a quarter bushing; others will stop reading here. As we waited for Inventor to start, his system slowed to a crawl: even opening a sticky note took significantly longer than it should have on a machine built in 2012 and equipped with an i7 chipset; after a minute or so, his fans kicked in adding a subtle whine to the din of our parents&#8217; voices downstairs. He dismissed the noise: &#8220;They turn on with the computer.&#8221; A better opportunity could not have presented itself on a silver platter as I explained that it took HandBrake encoding a 1080p video alongside Transmission saturating my internet connection to establish that my new Retina MacBook Pro did indeed possess fans; up until that point I had assumed it did, but as the weeks wore on without the slightest whir I had began to believe otherwise, that Apple had somehow managed to obviate the need for a cooling system within this tight aluminum clamshell. And then came the kicker: even under such an extreme load<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> my Mac has yet to experience a demonstrable decrease in performance.</p>
    
    <p>Using these qualities, made all the more attractive by the veritable wind tunnel his inch-and-a-half fan had created, as a jumping-off point, I continued expounding upon the virtues of this new machine: in addition to unfettered power and for all intents and purposes nonexistent fans, I still manage to get somewhere in the range of six to twelve hours of battery life depending on my use case in a laptop only slightly larger than his screen. I will not buy another Mac next time I need a new computer for love of the operating system, I explained, although OS X continues to grow on me the more I use it, but instead for the fantastic hardware that I cannot get anywhere else: while I may find a computer with similar technical specifications and maybe even at identical price points, I will never track down one also capable of running eight hours without charging or fitting inside a folder alongside my notebook paper. Zach&#8217;s article retroactively corroborated this statement: finding similar PC hardware proved just as impossible for Apple&#8217;s ten inch monster the Mac Pro as it would have for the MacBook Pro&#8217;s form factor, which is to say nothing for the price such typically commands in both machines. As Zach&#8217;s piece illustrated, in reality a comparable&#160;&#8212;&#160;based solely on performance&#160;&#8212;&#160;PC would cost significantly more than an offering from Apple.</p>
    
    <p>When building a PC, one must choose one or the other, power or form factor; when choosing an Apple product, one never need make such a demoralizing decision. This unique combination of attributes makes any &#8220;Apple tax&#8221; worth paying; the fact that no such premium exists in reality is icing on the cake.</p>
