<p>In 2012, Shawn Blanc marked the fifth anniversary of starting his site by publishing an article titled <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/07/50-things/"><em>50 Things I&#8217;ve Learned About Publishing a Weblog</em></a>. Filled with some of the best advice I have ever read on the subject, I return to this article every few months, gleaning just a little bit more each time. When I look back on the years since I started following Shawn, this piece stands out in my mind as his best work. And so, given how much I enjoyed his advice, I thought I would create my own list of lessons learned over the last few years of writing on the web.</p>

<p>Taking a cue from Shawn, I will do my best to keep most of these brief; however, a few warrant some explanation, and so when necessary I will break uniformity for the sake of clarity.</p>

<ul start='1'>
<li>The incumbents became huge and successful for a reason, and have remained huge and successful for a reason. The former and latter are not always the same.</li>
</ul>
<li>Failing to fully understand something is often the reason so many discount and disparage it.</li>

<li>Spend more time complimenting others&#8217; work than criticizing it.</li>

<li>"You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Credit Patrick McKenzie</a> for this gem I couldn&#8217;t resist adding in here.</li>

<li>Never say &#8220;I could have done that.&#8221; Maybe you could have, but you didn&#8217;t, so you have lost the privilege to claim that idea as your own.</li>

<li>Take incredible pride in your own work.</li>

<li>Show up every day prepared to work harder than yesterday.</li>

<li>Never waste your time.</li>

<li>Never waste another&#8217;s time.</li>

<li>Realize that everyone values their own time more than everyone else&#8217;s; in other words, as much as you value your own.</li>

<li>You will never regret reading more than you write.</li>

<li>Always have a good reason for everything you do.</li>

<li>Never lose sight of an ultimate end-goal informing your every decision, lest you stray from your intended path and fall to ruin.</li>

<li>You probably aren&#8217;t as smart as you think you are.</li>

<li>Everyone else is definitely not as dumb as you think.</li>

<li>You may very well be wrong.</li>

<li>You will always be wrong to someone.</li>

<li>For some, you will always be wrong.</li>

<li>Some people will never agree with you, no matter what you say or do or how much evidence you may present in support of your case.</li>

<li>Very few things are categorically anything.</li>

<li>Very few people consciously commit acts of wrongdoing or knowingly state inaccurate facts.</li>

<li>Everyone has their reasons, all of which are perfectly valid and justifiable in their mind.</li>

<li>Simple stupidity rarely motivates anyone.</li>

<li>Confrontation only solves problems when one party can force another to change the way they act and think. You can do neither over the internet.</li>

<li>Pay attention to the people who like you, and those who do not. Both their opinions have merit, both only to an extent. Take everything, both good and bad, with a grain of salt.</li>
