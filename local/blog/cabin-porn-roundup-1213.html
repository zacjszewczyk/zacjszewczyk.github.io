                    <p>A collection of my favorite cabins from <a href="http://cabinporn.com">Cabin Porn</a> and other similar sites, beginning with <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/68806432681">The Watershed</a>. A seventy-square-foot building in the woods of Oregon specifically designed as a writer&#8217;s retreat, I love the idea of a small, designated area set apart in which to conduct one&#8217;s most personal work. Although given the type of articles I traditionally post I feel such an environment would not be particularly conducive to my writing, but that said I would still love to try such a thing. Perhaps some day.</p>
                    
                    <p>Next in line we have an <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/69005844396/turf-a-frame-in-ansen-netherlands">A-frame built of turf in the Netherlands</a>. If I didn&#8217;t know better I would call this out as a scale model: for some reason it has that unreal vibe to it. But then again, so many of these cabins seem almost otherworldly. Who am I to judge?</p>
                    
                    <p>Rounding out the Cabin Porn trifecta we have an <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/69092889921/abandoned-shed-in-lake-paroho-south-korea">abandoned shed in South Korea</a> of all places. If I had to guess its location, I would have said West Virginia: I have seen a spot very much like this alongside a river many times when visiting friends there last summer. Who would have guessed that such a nondescript cabin as this one, one that could have just as easily come from the heart of America, would call South Korea home? Not me, for sure.</p>
                    
                    <p>I could have sworn I collected links from <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog">Huckberry</a> for <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-1113.html">last month&#8217;s roundup</a>, but it appears I only did so for other topics. Linking to <a href="http://huckberry.com/blog/posts/shelter-treehouse-x-three">this tree house</a>, then, marks the first time another site has appeared in the now-three-month-old Cabin Porn Roundups. Talk about a milestone. Seriously though, Peter Bahouth&#8217;s three tree houses outside Atlanta, Georgia, are extraordinary. When most think of a tree house, they reminisce on their childhood summers either spent in or yearning for one; Peter made that dream a reality. Good for him.</p>
                    
                    <p>The final link I have also came from Huckberry by way of Twitter: a picture of <a href="https://twitter.com/kaz/status/406515062392643584">the border between Norway and Sweden</a>. Absolutely beautiful; nothing else I can say will do this scene justice save urging you to check it out. What a fantastic picture.</p>
                    
                    <p>And that&#8217;s all I have for this month. In December I expanded the list of sites I cull pictures and articles from to two; hopefully in January I will continue this trend. Now that I have the whole posting on schedule thing down, after all, I need some goal to keep me going.</p>
