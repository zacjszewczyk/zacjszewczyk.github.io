<p>Once again, I&#8217;m back with some stellar cabins from around the world. This time, however, unlike past articles in this series and <a href="https://twitter.com/Gianlovessurf/status/484445366302281728">upon request by Gianfranco Lanzio</a>, I have bundled images alongside the appropriate paragraphs in an effort at more easily conveying the beauty of these structures and their accompanying sceneries. I hope you all like the result just as much as I do, and maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;even more.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Silos-Summer.jpg' alt='The Nicest Grain Silo You've Ever Slept In' title='The Nicest Grain Silo You've Ever Slept In' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Traveling the country has been a goal of mine for quite some time now, due in no small part to a desire to discover neat places like <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/escapes/base-camp/The-Nicest-Grain-Silo-Youve-Ever-Slept-In.html">this grain silo turned bed and breakfast</a> out in Oregon. I would love to spend a few days here, especially given that it remains a fully-functioning farm. Very cool.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/New-Brunswick-Canada.jpg' alt='Off-the-grid cabin, St. Francis River, New Brunswick, Canada.' title='Off-the-grid cabin, St. Francis River, New Brunswick, Canada' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Even nicer than <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90556105592/off-the-grid-cabin-st-francis-river-new">this little cabin in the woods of New Brunswick, Canada</a>, is the story its creator tells in reference to it: built in 1969 at the age of 26, Stephen Spang continues to return here to this day. Since I started putting these shorts posts together a year or so ago, I have found this often the case: the stories behind these cabins often trump the aesthetics of both the cabins themselves and their surroundings as well.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Starra-Lubovna-Slovakia.jpg' alt='Cottage 20 minutes outside Stara Lubovna, Slovakia.' title='Cottage 20 minutes outside Stara Lubovna, Slovakia.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p><a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90657516513/cottage-20-minutes-outside-stara-lubovna">This cottage</a> has a little bit of every one of my favorite things going for it: set in a quiet meadow, backed by a dense copse of pine trees, and shrouded in mist, I would love to take the photographer&#8217;s place and spend a while enjoying this picturesque scene; and if you&#8217;re in the mood for some more fantastic photography, <a href="http://frombusytoeasy.blogspot.sk">give their blog a shot</a>: Danka and Peter take some fantastic pictures.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Leon-Spain.jpg' alt='Caba&ntilde;a el Frade near Leon, Spain.' title='Caba&ntilde;a el Frade near Leon, Spain.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I could almost swear that I have seen <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90691568405/cabana-el-frade-near-leon-spain-contributed-by">this very cabin</a> somewhere else before, but I cannot for the life of my remember where. Regardless, it certainly deserves a mention here, especially when framed by such majestic mountains. Beautiful.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/White_Sea_Russia.jpg' alt='Cabin far in the forests of White Sea, Russia.' title='Cabin far in the forests of White Sea, Russia.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Russia has always been, and will unfortunately likely remain so for the foreseeable future, a black box of sorts: I will readily admit that I do not know a great deal about most countries in the world, but I know next to nothing about Russia with the exception of the vestigial horror stories leftover after the Cold War. Yet, the country still has cabins like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/91205474550/cabin-far-in-the-forests-of-white-sea-russia">this one</a> on the shore of the White Sea. And to me, that&#8217;s very cool.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Alfred-New-York.jpg' alt='Cabin in Alfred, New York.' title='Cabin in Alfred, New York.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I have traveled a great deal in my lifetime, but have never made it any further west than Wisconsin, and despite visiting many states on and around the east coast, have yet to travel any further north than Pennsylvania. On my someday-maybe list is New York, for precisely this reason: not just to see the city, but to visit the beautiful countryside of upstate New York such as the area <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/91453391635/cabin-in-alfred-new-york-contributed-by-graham">this cabin</a> is set in as well. I would love to spend some time trekking through these woods.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/burntside-lodge-minnesota-lake_h.jpg' alt='An Old-School Northwoods Outfit' title='An Old-School Northwoods Outfit' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>I spent a week in northern Minnesota at a friend&#8217;s cabin once, and ever since then I have wanted to go back: it&#8217;s just such a cool, interesting, and fun part of the country. Now, there certainly is something to be said for roughing it in a rustic cabin or out tent camping in the middle of the woods, but for everyone else that wants to experience what quickly became one of my favorite places in the country, there&#8217;s always <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/escapes/base-camp/An-Old-School-North-Woods-Outfit.html">the Burntside Lodge</a>. As much as I love primitive camping, even I could spend some time here. It would be rough, but someone has to do it.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Lake-St-Clair-Tasmania.jpg' alt='Kitchen Hut on Cradle Mountain, Lake St. Clair National Park, Tasmania.' title='Kitchen Hut on Cradle Mountain, Lake St. Clair National Park, Tasmania.' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>A <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/92145389548/kitchen-hut-on-cradle-mountain-lake-st-clair">quaint cabin</a> in Lake St. Clair National Park, Tasmania. Off in the distance, you can just make out the valley below Cradle Mountain through the mist; what a view that must be.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='http://33.media.tumblr.com/6dbc3b0a225ff8cc545e8d85195e7abf/tumblr_n9fiklALuY1qzwmsso1_1280.jpg' alt='Geodesic Dome near Brittany, France' title='Geodesic Dome near Brittany, France' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>A neat <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/93133184070/geodesic-dome-near-plouneour-menez-brittany">dome cabin</a> built entirely of wood and located near the Brittany region of France. I love the unconventional structure&#160;&#8212;&#160;very cool.</p>
