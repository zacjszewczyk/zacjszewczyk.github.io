<p>Last November, I barely managed to stay within my data limit: roughly halfway through, Verizon sent me a message saying that I had already reached 90<code> of my alloted bandwidth. Given that I had just recently decided to stream all of my music with iTunes Match rather than sync more than a thousand songs to a newly replaced iPhone, it should have come as no surprise. For the following two weeks I carefully metered my 3G usage, doing far less on my phone than usual; nevertheless, I soon hit 95</code> and, wanting to avoid an overage charge, stopped opening even images on Twitter off of WiFi. Thankfully, my billing cycle ended soon after that and I could start with a clean, music streaming-free slate.</p>

<p>That disconcerting, unfamiliar lack of freedom in today&#8217;s world where mediocre-speed cellular data connections have effectively removed the boundaries of location to consuming and producing content took away&#160;&#8212;&#160;albeit briefly&#160;&#8212;&#160;from my iPhone experience. For a while, I could use this mobile computer for nothing more than I would a prepaid phone; I did not buy an iPhone for such a use case. Unlike <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/att-sponsored-data-2/">Nilay Patel</a>, then, who sees AT&T&#8217;s Sponsored Data program as an evil to fight tooth and nail until it eventually, inevitably, becomes a reality, I see it&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/att-sponsored-data/">just as Shawn Blanc does</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;as one more way Apple and other large tech companies can improve their users&#8217; experience: perhaps Apple will subsidize music streaming costs for iTunes Match subscribers. If that means an extra $5, $10, or $15 a <em>year</em> over the paltry $20 I pay now, I am absolutely fine with that.</p>

<p>On the topic of AT&#38;T, before closing I would like to briefly note that while everyone seems to focus on Verizon when it comes to large American cellphone networks, the greatest innovations in this industry&#160;&#8212;&#160;think the first-generation iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;started with AT&#38;T. Perhaps because of where I live or the circles I travel in I see and hear of Verizon disproportionately more when compared to other parts of the country, but regardless it seems like rather than Verizon we ought to look towards AT&#38;T when trying to discern the future of the American mobile phone industry. Like the iPhone, Sponsored Date very well could revolutionize this market once again. Coming from AT&#38;T, it&#8217;s off to a good start.</p>
