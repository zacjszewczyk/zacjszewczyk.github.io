                    <p>I love The Verge&#160;&#8212;&#160;I really do. Not long after posting <a href="https://zacs.siteblog/bullies.html"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>, where I took Josh Topolsky to task for his wholly inappropriate reaction to many justifiable criticisms regarding his publication&#8217;s device reviews, I subscribed to The Verge. Today it not only serves as my primary news source, but I also follow The Vergecast and tune in for their live coverage of Apple&#8217;s events. Lately, however, I have been increasingly disappointed with their work.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Verge started out as a publication geared towards geeks, covering tech topics and providing device reviews; at its launch, the site marketed itself as&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least appeared to&#160;&#8212;&#160;the news source for those who had no interest in traditional channels. As such, it quickly gained great popularity amongst the tech elite and common folk alike. Recently though, I have watched The Verge slowly diverge<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> from its original path and branch out in an effort to become the very news outlet it sought to obviate at its inception.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ernest Hemingway once said, &#8220;You go bankrupt in two ways: gradually, then suddenly.&#8221; The Verge&#8217;s journalism has declined in a similar way: earlier this month they posted their first ridiculously titled article, which I just <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/397344923705671680">couldn&#8217;t resist chiming in on</a>: &#8220;Helium-filled hard drives balloon storage space&#8221;.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>Ugh</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my mind, this marked the beginning of that sudden phase Ernest Hemingway spoke of. From yesterday: <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/405430356037218305"><em>The CIA reportedly turned some Guantanamo Bay detainees into double agents to fight al-Qaeda</em></a>. <em>How</em> is this news? If Homeland<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> has taught us anything, <em>that&#8217;s the game</em>: you capture someone and turn them, simple as that. Absolutely no one should be surprised by this. And then from earlier today, <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/405642475043168257"><em>NSA spied on porn habits of Muslim &#8220;radicalizers&#8221; in efforts to discredit them</em></a>. If I had to list ten reasons the NSA could use to explain spying on a foreign national, discrediting a radical leader in the eyes of his followers would have been in the top five. These are <em>not</em> news stories; these are pleas for pageviews.</p>
                    
                    <p>They say a country is not a democracy until the group in power peacefully hands the reigns over to the next as dictated by the populace&#8217;s wishes. This event occurred in American history with the rise of the Jeffersonians usurping Washington&#8217;s government in a landslide victory. I don&#8217;t think it would be altogether inappropriate to place a similar qualification on a website becoming something more than a glorified blog: you are not a true news outlet in the traditional sense of the word until you run a sensationally-titled article with no bearing on your original direction for no other reason than attracting pageviews; the corollary being that in order to stay the devolution into mass-market media outlet one must say no to publishing an article not in line with the publication&#8217;s original direction based on principle. Failing that, just as the peaceful transition of power in a government solidifies it as a functioning democracy, with a single piece you will have signaled the transition to a mainstream news outlet. In the last month in particular, The Verge has finally managed to cross that Rubicon. Unfortunately, they never intended to. They marketed themselves as something more&#160;&#8212;&#160;something different that the status quo. In the end, though, nothing really changed.</p>
