<p>Over the years I have dialed in my writing process. I started typing posts in a textbox on Zoomshare; nowadays, I write in a powerful text editor, track changes with version control software, keep redundant backups, and serve this site with a back-end I wrote myself. I have set myself up well with a pretty neat workflow, and today I want to share it with you.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyDevices">My Devices<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyDevices">#</a></span></h3>

<p>At home, I write on a late 2013 15" Retina MacBook Pro. Although Apple updated this line a few times after I bought mine, I have no reason to get a new one. I <a href="/projects.html">write, code, and build 3D models</a> on it without a problem. The battery lasts long enough for hours of work away from my desk. I plan to upgrade someday, but see no reason to anytime soon. Those in the market for a new computer ought to consider that: how many six year old PCs still work today, and out of those, how many still run well? My DELL laptops used to have a thirty-six month life cycle. I have little interest in the Mac vs PC debate anymore, but I will say that the longer lifespan of an Apple computer makes the annual cost of owning one much lower, and means you will have a well-functioning device for much longer than you would a PC.</p>

<p>Away from home, I create on my iPhone. For the last year or so before <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">I stopped writing</a>, an iPad also played an important role in this process. I used the same workflow there that I use on my iPhone today, which I talk about below, to create almost everything I posted. I liked that setup: its simplicity and portability, and the focus it imposed, worked well for me. Since then iPads have become much more powerful, so I can&#8217;t wait to revisit this soon.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyEditors">My Editors<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyEditors">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Recall that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/why-i-write-in-plain-text.html">I write in plain text, formatted in Markdown, and that I proof everything</a> before I post it. On my home computer, I prefer <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. Cross-platform, fast, and feature-rich, I use this editor to write the articles that appear here, and the code that generates the site behind the scenes. It does everything I ask of it so well, it feels like a tool purpose-built for the job at hand&#160;&#8212;&#160;every single time. I cannot recommend this editor enough.</p>

<p>Before I post, I proof everything with a program of my own design. I once used <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked 2</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/integrating-sublime-text-and-marked-2.html">for this</a>, but grew out of the app, so I created <a href="/projects.html#proofer">Proofer</a>. Proofer takes a much more granular look at flaws in my writing, generates more statistics, and creates a live preview using my blog&#8217;s exact layout. This program has become an indispensable tool in my writing toolkit, so I made it available over on <a href="/projects.html#codingProjects">my projects page</a> for anyone who wants to check it out.</p>

<p>On my phone, I love <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> for capturing notes and article ideas. Its fast, simple interface makes that easy. I just open it and write. Most of the time I turn those tidbits into new posts on my computer, but every once in a while, I use <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> to create articles or edit ones I already have in the works. This app can access, edit, and save plain text files to the Dropbox account synced with my home computer, so I move my work from Drafts to this app before I spend any time developing it. Working in Editorial means I have a local copy and a versioned cloud backup through Dropbox in case something goes wrong, and gives me access to a host of helpful Markdown automation tools. Draftsâ€™ sister app, Terminology, also comes in handy whenever I write in the go. Together, these three make it easy to capture new ideas, and streamlines their development into the articles you see here.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MyBackups">My Backups<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MyBackups">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I spend a lot of time, energy, and effort writing, so I cannot abide the thought of losing anything. To lower that risk, I use a tiered backup scheme. This means everything I write exists in at least two places at all times; by the end of each day, that number goes up to six. I have four different off-site backups, one on-site copy on a local external drive, and the original on my local machine. Thanks to some neat automation work, none of this takes more than a few minutes.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Dropbox">Dropbox<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Dropbox">#</a></span></h4>

<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/psa-dropbox-shouldnt-be-your-sole-backup-for-your-file-1612803794">Dropbox does not count as a backup</a>. In brief, at the free tier it stores deleted files for just thirty days, and it propagates all changes&#160;&#8212;&#160;even mass file deletions or corruptions&#160;&#8212;&#160;in real time. With that said, it can still fill an important niche as part of a broader backup scheme. By monitoring your files and sending changes to the cloud in real time, Dropbox enables short-term recovery should you spill a drink on your computer, for example, or want to reexamine a first draft of a document up to thirty days later. This service does a great job of covering the gap between the permanent backups below.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="VersionControl">Version Control<span>&nbsp;<a href="#VersionControl">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I use version control for all my <a href="/projects.html#codingProjects">coding projects</a>, and for writing, too. In the software world, this allows many developers to work on a single project at once. Anyone can change a file, add a note, and then send it to a central server where his or her colleagues will see the change. Every time I hit a milestone while writing, I add a note, then <em>commit</em> it to private repositories <a href="https://alexarmstrong.net/2015/01/pushing-to-multiple-git-repos">on GitHub and Bitbucket</a>. This accomplishes two things: it gives me two off-site backups, and lets me view older versions of an article anytime I want to. These repositories will also store every version of my files, even if I delete them, as long as GitHub and Bitbucket stay online. I rest easier at night knowing I can recover everything I have ever written, no matter what happens.</p>

<p>It does not take much to annotate and commit a changed file, and Ire Aderinokun makes it even easier with <a href="https://bitsofco.de/git-aliases-for-lazy-developers/">some helpful aliases</a>. I took this a step further with <a href="/projects.html#GitBackup">my GitBackup project</a>, which monitors a target directory for changes and then commits the new files with a generic message. I can still choose to do milestone-based versioning, but GitBackup turns these version control servers into a second real-time backup to two more off-site locations&#160;&#8212;&#160;like Dropbox, but without Dropbox&#8217;s time-based limitations.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="Backblaze">Backblaze<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Backblaze">#</a></span></h4>

<p>Version control backs up my files on a per-project basis; Dropbox covers more of my system by monitoring an entire directory, but Backblaze tracks every single file on my computer. I pay $5 a month, and the company keeps a copy of my entire machine on their servers. Due to the volume of files it has to process, Backblaze catches changes about an hour after I make them. Thanks to Dropbox and version control, though, I can live with that gap. This service brings the number of off-site copies of my data up to four.</p>

<h4 class="headers" id="TimeMachine">Time Machine<span>&nbsp;<a href="#TimeMachine">#</a></span></h4>

<p>I also use Time Machine. Time Machine backs up everything to a local drive in my house. Although this will not save me from a fire, for example, I can use it to recover files if something happens to my computer anywhere else. Including this, my data exists in four off-site locations, one on-site drive, and on my home computer. Since everything except my local backup runs 24/7, I just have to plug one USB cable in once a day; in exchange, I get a comprehensive, overlapping backup schema that ensures I can recover my most important files no matter what happens, all for the low price of $5 per month.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="MySite">My Site<span>&nbsp;<a href="#MySite">#</a></span></h3>

<p>We have gone over the devices I use, the editors I write in, and the backups that keep it all safe; now I want to focus on this site. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/introducing-firstcrack.html">I</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/firstcrack-in-practice.html">have</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/complete-overhaul.html">not</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">talked</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-i-do-what-i-do.html">about</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/firstcrack-10.html">First Crack</a> in a long time. Over on <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">my projects page</a>, I explain that I no longer publish updates to <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">the source code</a>, but hope to start again someday. That day has not yet come, but as I continue making major changes to the system, know that it will soon.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, I created First Crack in 2012. Powerful engines like WordPress and Joomla had dominated the space, but I had no use for the majority of their features. I wanted a lightweight blogging engine that would take plain text files formatted in Markdown, and turn them into a simple and fast static blog. Nothing fit the bill, though, so I created something that did. First Crack will turn a thousand articles into a fast and full-featured site like this one in less than two seconds. I take a lot of pride in this project and the progress I have made over the last seven years. Again, I will start publishing the source code soon.</p>

<p>Once First Crack builds the site, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli">the Firebase CLI</a> handles everything else. I can preview my site on any device in my local network with <code>firebase serve</code>, and then make it public with <code>firebase deploy</code>. It&#8217;s that simple. Look for a more in-depth article on this soon.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a>. I have three Terminal windows open on a normal day: one to commit changes to First Crack, a second for managing version control as I write, and a third for miscellaneous tasks while I work. tmux adds panes to a single Terminal window, all with their own bash process. In practice, this lets me take three windows and condense them into a single one. Crafting the command to create that environment took <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40009032">a bit of work</a>, but I figured it out. Now I store it in my <code>.bash_profile</code> file, which creates this environment every time I type in the letter <code>t</code>. The snippet below shows a more complex, five pane interface I used for an old development and writing environment:</p>

<pre>
$ alias t="tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; select-pane -t 0 \; split-window -h \; select-pane -t 2 \; send-keys 'cd /Website' C-m \; send-keys './start_server' C-m \; split-window -h \; send-keys 'cd /Proofer' C-m \; send-keys 'gs ' C-m \; split-window -h \; send-keys 'cd /GitBackup' C-m \; send-keys 'gs' C-m \; select-pane -t 0 \; send-keys 'cd /Standalone; gs' C-m \; select-pane -t 1 \; send-keys 'cd /Website/Articles; gs' C-m \;"
</pre>

<p>This gave me a five pane Terminal window, started the Node.js server, and checked the git repositories for changes to First Crack, the site&#8217;s content, and the Proofer and GitBackup code bases. From there I can start working. It also helped <a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/">to turn on tmux&#8217;s mouse mode</a>, and create a second alias to turn everything off: <code>alias kt=&#8220;tmux kill-server&#8221;</code>. I also find it helpful to have <a href="http://teamviewer.com/">TeamViewer</a> Host installed, just in case I need GUI access to my server.</p>

<p>Together these systems, programs, and services give me the ability to write anywhere without worry of losing my work, and manage this site from any machine with a shell. I can start working on my phone, finish an article on my home computer, and then use my phone to post it on the road. Whatever I want to do, I can with this setup. I have put a lot of work into it in over the years, and I believe I have created something to be proud of.</p>
