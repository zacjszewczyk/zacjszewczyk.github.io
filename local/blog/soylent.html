<p>&#8220;Hacking the body is high risk, high reward. I read a textbook on physiological chemistry and took to the internet to see if I could find every known essential nutrient. My kitchen soon looked like a chemistry lab and I had every unknown substance in a glass in front of me. I was a little worried it was going to kill me, but decided it was for science and quickly downed the whole thing. To my surprise, it was quite tasty and I felt very energetic. For 30 days I avoided food entirely and I monitored the contents of my blood and physical performance. Mental performance is harder to quantify, but I feel much sharper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curious after reading Monica Heisey&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/rob-rhinehart-no-longer-requires-food"><em>This Man Thinks He Never Has to Eat Again</em></a>, from which I took the excerpt above, I headed over to Rob Rhinehart&#8217;s personal blog <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/">Mostly Harmless</a> looking for some more information on Soylent. What I found in <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298"><em>How I Stopped Eating Food</em></a> and the follow-up article <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424"><em>What&#8217;s In Soylent</em></a>, in which Rob chronicled the creation and resulting physical and psychological benefits of Soylent, along with the ingredients and reasons for which he chose to include them, respectively, fascinated me. I look forward to hearing a lot more from Rob in the near future: Soylent is an extremely novel and promising idea, and one that has the potential to not only revolutionize our lives, but the world as well.</p>
