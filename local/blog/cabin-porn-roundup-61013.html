<p>It has been quite a while since I posted one of these&#160;&#8212;&#160;more than a month, in fact: the last came out at <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/cabin-porn-roundup-414.html">the beginning of May</a>. Today, I finally have cause to bring this series back. Finally&#160;&#8212;&#160;far too long has passed during which I had no cause to sit down and revel in the simple beauty of nature and its rustic inhabitants.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/86501972746/adelaide-tarn-hut-near-kahurangi-national-park">a quaint hut near Kahurangi National Park, New Zealand</a>. As is often the case with many of these cabins, the scenery surrounding this little structure vastly outclasses the small building at its heart; beautiful. And those mountains&#160;&#8212;&#160;they just beg to be climbed. I could have a <em>lot</em> of fun here.</p>

<p>Another small cabin that, like the previous entry, sits on the shore of a lake. This one, however, hails from the <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/87631807475/boat-house-in-stockholm-archipelago-sweden">Stockholm archipelago in Sweden</a>. It reminds me of a friend&#8217;s cabin in northern Minnesota, albeit his was slightly larger than this one, and set slightly farther back from the shore. Ah, the good times we had there.</p>

<p>Significantly closer to me than both the last two, this <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/88406543967/abandoned-cabin-southeast-of-salt-lake-city-utah">abandoned cabin southeast of Salt Lake City, Utah</a>, is just incredible. I can&#8217;t quite decide if it is the mountains rising up to the cabin&#8217;s left and right or the backdrop of pine trees that make it so appealing to me, but regardless I would love to happen upon this one when out on a hike.</p>

<p><a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/88393708085/scotts-cabin-beaver-brook-ny-contributed">Scott&#8217;s Cabin</a> located in Beaver Brook, NY, where the editors of Cabin Porn live. A better, larger image can be found at <a href="http://beaverbrook.com/post/88393649009/scotts-cabin">Beaver Brook&#8217;s tumblr page</a>, but you don&#8217;t have to go there to appreciate the simple beauty of this neat cabin.</p>

<p>When I think of New York, I picture skyscrapers and traffic&#160;&#8212;&#160;anything but the rustic cabins I link to in these posts, really. But maybe that&#8217;s why Ben Dickson decided to build <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/89108493870/backyard-tea-shed-in-clinton-hill-brooklyn">a backyard &#8220;tea shed&#8221;</a> in the heart of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to take a long hiking trip in the winter. A few summers ago I spent a week on the Appalachian trail, but as of yet have not spent any time out in all but the most clement of weather. <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/88994321305/log-cabin-in-eastern-sayan-mountains-siberia">This log cabin in the Eastern Sayan Mountains of Siberia</a> reminds me of that desire every time I see it. Perhaps someday; until then, though, it&#8217;s great to have something to keep that wish at the forefront of my mind.</p>

<p>Not much of <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/90060317355/jackal-hut-rocky-mountains-colorado">a cabin</a> to look at, from what we can see here anyway, but with a sky like this who needs to keep their eyes turned anywhere but skyward? More beautiful scenery from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would love to visit there one day.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sights like <a href="http://cabinporn.com/post/89757711805/abandoned-a-frames-in-lago-general-carrera">this one on the Lago General Carrera river in Chilean Patagonia</a> that make me want to drop everything, load a backpack, and spend a long, long time backpacking in different places across the world in search of a much simpler, less stressful life. Give me one of these alongside a river like this and I would be happy.</p>

<p>This time from one of my favorite new sites, Bless This Stuff, <a href="http://www.blessthisstuff.com/stuff/living/living-space/casa-till-by-wmr-architects/">Casa Till</a>. My dream house would be slightly less gaudy, but I definitely would not turn down some time here.</p>

<p>So there you have it, nine neat cabins and otherwise cool structures set amidst beautiful scenery. It&#8217;s great to be back.</p>
