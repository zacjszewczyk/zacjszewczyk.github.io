<p>The only thing I love more than listening to podcasts is writing about them. During <a href="http://curiousrat.com/the-state-of-podcasting-2013">the last curfuffle</a> I wrote <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union.html"><em>Podcasting State of the Union</em></a> where I did my best to provide counterpoints for the flaws Harry Marks pointed out in the podcasting industry. To my delight, <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke/status/387840995465105408">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/387879318774620160">agreed</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattalexand/status/387917466325622784">with</a> me. After a few days the heat died down though, and I did not expect to have another opportunity to discuss this topic for a while. Then Ben Brooks decided to stir the pot once more with <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/podcasts-worries/"><em>Why Tech Podcasts Bother Me</em></a>, and <a href="http://buildingtwenty.net/posts/podcasts">many</a> <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/2013-12-that-podcast-bombshell">responded</a> with wildly different opinions. Perhaps most notably, Andrew Clark and Zac Cichy of <a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a> surprised me in <a href="http://themenubar.net/podcastfeed/tmb-ep034">episode thirty-four</a> by agreeing with the majority of Ben&#8217;s points.</p>

<p>Like his predecessor Harry Marks, Ben&#8217;s critiques focused on many of the same aspects: a lack of preparation beforehand and focus throughout leading to a rambling program, the pervasive &#8220;good ol&#8216; boy&#8221; mentality driving shows less about specific topics and more about the hosts themselves, and little to no polish. In fact, during the first eleven minutes of the The Menu Bar&#8217;s thirty-fifth episode Harry Marks, in reference to Ben&#8217;s piece, said that both articles &#8220;hit many of the same points, except his was a lot more colorful&#8221;, which I found amusing. <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/podcasts-worries/#identifier_4_15683">To not waste your time</a> by reiterating my refutations of those points once again, let me translate: Ben&#8217;s complaints equate to Harry&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes or Less&#8221;, &#8220;Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little&#8221;, &#8220;&#8217;Tis the Season&#8221;, and &#8220;Edit, Edit, Edit&#8221;, respectively, which I tackle <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#60MinutesorLess">here</a>, <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#PickaLittleTalkaLittle">here</a>, <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#TistheSeason">here</a>, and <a href="Podcasting-State-of-the-Union.htm#EditEditEdit">here</a>. Since I have already discussed these topics at length, I will not do so again here as I feel my opinions still stand. I will, however, focus on another subject Andrew and Zac brought up on <em>How the Andrew Stole Christmas</em>: podcast playback speeds.</p>

<p>Back in October Marco posted an article titled <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/18/podcast-app-playback-speeds"><em>Podcast App Playback Speed</em></a> where he explained that when most podcast apps advertise playback speeds other than 1x, they actual play audio at another. From his article:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;In the early days of iOS podcast playback, when Apple first implemented multiple speed settings, they used inaccurate labels. Apple&#8217;s &#8216;2x&#8217; setting, for instance, was really 1.5x. Their &#8216;1.5x&#8217; setting was really 1.25x. And their &#8216;1/2x&#8217; setting was really 0.8x.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will note that under this system playback tops out at 1.5x, labeled at 2x, yet apps like Instacast still sport a &#8220;3x&#8221; mode. Unlike Pocket Casts, which plays audio back at <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/18/podcast-app-playback-speeds#fn:pIAXwbhkM2">three times the default rate</a>, Instacast uses a &#8220;3x&#8221; moniker to play episodes back at double speed. This is all important to keep in mind when I finally drop the bombshell that I often listen to my favorite podcasts at up to &#8220;3x&#8221; speed, i.e. twice as fast as the producers intended. For those of you incapable of doing math, that means it can take me thirty minutes to get through an hour-long show. Even more so than a daily hour-long commute and a job that often allows me to plug a pair of headphones in for a couple hours each day, this habit enables me to continue expanding my podcast queue.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Apparently in the world of podcast producers, everyone hates this practice: both Andrew and Zac came down hard on it, and Marco would rather &#8220;unsubscribe to a third of my shows or skip a third of the episodes&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the thing&#160;&#8212;&#160;<em>here&#8217;s the thing, Dan: you can&#8217;t replace a gorilla with a watermelon.</em></p>

<p>No, on a more serious note: I cannot listen to podcasts at 1x: it makes me want to tear my headphones out and disavow podcasts altogether; it feels as if the hosts speak maddeningly slow just to infuriate me as I sit there waiting what feels like an eternity just for him to finish a single thought. If I could not increase my playback speed, I would seriously have to consider the number of podcasts I subscribe to not necessarily because I could no longer cut down on the time required to finish any given episode, but simply because I could not bear sitting through anywhere near as many shows only to fidget irritatedly as the hosts plod along in their speech. But I can toggle that speed, which both enables and allows me to follow so many more great shows than I would otherwise.</p>

<p>To me, vilifying this feature makes as little sense as prosecuting Instapaper would: I save every article I come across to Instapaper so that I can easily find it later, yes, but mostly because I hate the vast majority of mobile websites. I still want to read and have a great deal of respect for the words within those pages though, so I use this service to remove the one barrier to a pleasurable ordeal reading another&#8217;s prose. In more abstract terms, I find valuable ideas and change the way in which they get presented to me pursuant of a superior experience. Similarly with podcasts, I realize the difficulty of speaking. Furthermore, doing it well proves even more challenging&#160;&#8212;&#160;I know because a few weeks ago I tried recording my voice for an audition to Brett Terpstra&#8217;s Systematic, and it sounded terrible. Just because someone makes a podcast does not mean they have the voice, vocabulary, or diction to do so well, yet many&#160;&#8212;&#160;thankfully&#160;&#8212;&#160;overcome those inhibitions and hit the record button anyway. While few possess all three imperfections, many have one, and bumping my playback speed up to 1.5x&#160;&#8212;&#160;true 1.25x, the lowest I can listen to any podcast these days&#160;&#8212;&#160;helps smooth over the verbal flaws that otherwise lend themselves to an overall less pleasurable encounter. Just as my decision to take nearly every author&#8217;s content out of its intended setting does not reflect a lack of regard for their work, neither does this choice. In fact, it is out of respect that I do it in the first place: I hold these people and their ideas in such high regard that I just <em>have</em> to listen to their shows, objections be damned. Very few podcast hosts claim to be great at what they do, and by slightly increasing my playback speed I can get through their vocal quirks much more easily. What&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>

<p>Playback speeds are not evil incarnate; it&#8217;s about time we stopped pretending they were.</p>

<p>Obviously, by my own words at this point I have only justified playback up to 1.25x. However, once you let go of the ridiculous notion that playing another&#8217;s voice back at integer-greater-than-one-x equates to a lack of respect for their work, anything greater than 1x becomes merely a matter of preference. Do you enjoy fast talkers? Go ahead and bump that up to 2x. Do you enjoy larger fonts? Go ahead and resize Instapaper&#8217;s font.</p>

<p id='fn1'><a class='fn' title='return to article' href='#fnref1'>&#x21a9;</a>&nbsp;Since October when I posted <em>Podcasting State of the Union</em>, I have subscribed to nine more podcasts: <a href="http://justthetip.fm">Just the Tip</a>, <a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us">Technical Difficulties US</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/bestof">The Best of 5by5</a>, <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug">Debug</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power Users</a>, <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/">Unprofessional</a>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/video/the-vergecast">The Vergecast</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic">Systematic</a>, and <a href="http://5by5.tv/homework">Homework</a>. Of those nine I have listened to the entirety of The Best of 5by5, Systematic, and Homework, and have already started on Just the Tip and Debug. Until I finish those two, the others are much more hit and miss: unless an episode features someone I know and like a great deal, they will have to wait their turn.</p>
