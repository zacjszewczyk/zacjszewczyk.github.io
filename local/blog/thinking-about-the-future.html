<p>The past ten days have astounded me. I entered 2014 with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/doing-monetization-well.html">low expectations</a>, tentatively hoping to increase my readership by some small integer multiple year over year. Over the next two weeks, however, I surpassed traffic for the entirety of 2013 with fifteen days left in January. What&#8217;s more, these readers keep coming back: although pageviews decreased after the initial surge from Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s link faded, my readership has continued to grow since then at an impressive (and mildly alarming) rate. RSS subscriptions have increased as well by a factor of five, and I now have nearly as many signed up for my newsletter as I had daily visitors in 2013. This has given me a great deal to think about, and forced me to keep my head down working feverishly in my every spare moment. Now, though, with a brief respite between articles, I have started thinking about the future.</p>

<p>As promised, I began publishing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-neat-and-out-of-scope-newsletter.html">The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter</a> when I realized the unlikelihood of my traffic ever returning to the low figures I saw throughout 2013. I did not, however, expect those numbers to bottom out well above the halfway point in my goals list: I felt comfortable expecting to double my daily readership, and optimistic that I could triple it. I saw only ludicrousy in hoping for anything more. Yet here I stand, traffic increasing at an incredible ~30% every day. I have a great deal of catching up to do, then: by my own goals, I now owe everyone two newsletters, at least one of which published weekly. I also need to start seeking out sponsorships, and begin accepting memberships. Learning about GitHub, given that I promised to make beta versions of my code projects available to members, would be a worthwhile investment as well. While I&#8217;m at it, I should begin exploring podcasting equipment too: at this point, it looks like I will cross that mark in February.</p>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>So this is what I&#8217;m thinking: I have already started preparing for the next installment of The Neat and Out of Scope Newsletter, slated for January 26th, so I will release it as scheduled; next month, I will begin sending it out weekly unless its current subscribers <a href="https://twitter.com/zacjszewczyk/status/423839263793623040">feel I ought to do otherwise</a>. As for my more data-driven mailing list, I will include its content at the end of my existing newsletter until it grows large enough to merit a publication of its own. I have traditionally shunned the job of an analyst, so this entire subject is new to me. Proceeding in this way will allow me to ease myself into this new role.</p>

<p>As for actually generating some revenue, I expected that my growth to 2000 monthly visitors would take significantly longer than it did. With not even a month of statistics under my belt, I cannot feasibly elicit sponsorships from anyone. Instead, I will wait until April when I can show three months&#8217; worth of metrics, at which point I believe I can make a good case for an individual or company handing over a sum of money in exchange for featuring an app or service here. Similarly, I will wait to begin offering memberships for a little bit longer until I can stabilize this hectic pace. Unless traffic takes a drastic dive between now and April, I will begin accepting memberships first. Rather than build my own system and deal with that hassle, I plan to go with Memberful which I found <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/15/independence-day-three/">thanks to Brett Terpstra</a>, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/">who just quit his job</a> and <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/brett-terpstra-goes-indie/">went indie</a>. Given that I based my plans for a podcast on sponsorships and offering two distinct versions&#160;&#8212;&#160;one with ads and the other without&#160;&#8212;&#160;and its reliance on a group of members to publish for, I must postpone this, too, at least until May. However, when I do finally get around to it, I know where to go: Dan Benjamin just posted the update to his 2011 article <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/podcasting-equipment-software-guide-2011"><em>Podcasting Equipment Guide</em></a> as its own, standalone site: <a href="http://www.podcastinghandbook.co">The Podcasting Handbook</a>. When I start my daily podcast, I will look there for all my equipment needs.</p>

<p>I realize I have not quite lived up to my promises, now that I have deigned to push a number of these ventures back by a fairly significant amount of time; however, more important than just doing another newsletter, asking for sponsorships, and putting out a podcast is&#160;&#8212;&#160;to me&#160;&#8212;&#160;doing it <em>well</em>. I want to take pride in everything I publish. If that means shifting my timeline slightly, that&#8217;s fine with me.</p>
