<p>Sam Dogen had another thought-provoking post over at Financial Samurai recently, this time looking at the very interesting difference between the way that Americans and Europeans in particular view money. I encourage you to read the entire thing: <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-europeans-see-money-differently-from-americans/">How Europeans See Money Differently From Americans</a>. Most interesting out of this entire piece, though, and definitely the most impactful statement for me, was that of his conclusion: &#8220;Remember that money is only a means to an end. What is your end?&#8221;</p>

<p>I finished last semester&#8217;s final exam on a Monday, and Tuesday I began work full-time, 8-4, 40 hours a week. Since then, I have picked up two more part-time jobs, ensuring that I have little time for anything but work. And that has been great, don&#8217;t get me wrong: I have bills to pay, and a slippery road late one night last winter made sure one of those bills was quite large. However, it also means I have not had a great deal of time to do many of the things I wanted to do this summer, unfortunately. Much too late, I&#8217;m afraid, within the last week or two, I have started to really take <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/its-not-about-the-money.html">my own words to heart</a> in asking, &#8220;What is the point of having all this money if I don&#8217;t do anything with it and with the people I enjoy spending time with?&#8221; And so that&#8217;s part of the reason my girlfriend and I went on a helicopter ride last weekend: money is great to have, but it&#8217;s completely useless if you never use it. I want to use it to make memories, and to do things that will leave a lasting impression that no number of digits could ever hope to. Going forward, that&#8217;s my plan; that is my end.</p>
