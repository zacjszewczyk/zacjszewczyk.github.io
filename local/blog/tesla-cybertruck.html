<p>I like to think about things. To riff off <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/start-before-you-think-youre-ready.html">Austin Kleon</a>, I want to become a professional writer so that I can be a professional thinker. For now, though, as I have said <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/life-is-a-hallway.html">many</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">times</a> <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">before</a>, I write to clarify, condense, and record my thoughts. I have sat down today to talk about Tesla&#8217;s new Cybertruck&#160;&#8212;&#160;not because the Internet needs <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hot-takes-on-teslas-cybertruck.html">one more hot take</a>, but rather to pursue those goals.</p>

<p>I will spend little time on the boring stuff. Every website, blog, and Social Median&trade; has covered those subjects well enough by now. In brief, then: </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>On the design</strong>: Art is subjective, but design is objective. From the former, subjective standpoint, I see the Cybertruck as a step in <a href="https://gearpatrol.com/2019/11/23/can-truly-beautiful-car-designs-even-exist-anymore/">a good direction</a>; from the latter, objective point of view, I feel less certain. The Cybertruck&#8217;s rigid shell and harsh angles seem to make it a crash test and pedestrian nightmare. Some middle ground must exist between the traditional aluminum and fiberglass body panels I can deform by hand, and the ultra-durable plate steel common in military vehicles, though; perhaps Tesla struck that balance. The unibody platform <a href="https://jalopnik.com/mid-size-trucks-dont-need-frames-1785674405">makes sense</a>, and <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/tesla-cybertruck">by</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-impressions-ride/">all</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk">accounts</a>, the spacious interior will even appease the large market segment who prefer luxe finishes in their utility vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>On the specs</strong>: The Cybertruck specs are good for an electric vehicle, but mediocre for a truck&#160;&#8212;&#160;and bad at $70,000. Do not judge this polygon&#160;&#8212;&#160;with a 14,000 pound towing capacity, 3,500 pound payload, and 500 mile range&#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="https://jalopnik.com/heres-how-tesla-played-itself-with-the-cybertruck-vs-f-1840064923">against an entry-level, $30,000 F-150</a>. Instead, look at the top-of-the-line, $70,000 Cybertruck versus a not-quite-top-of-the-line, $60,000 F-450. For that price, I could get a monstrous truck with a 500 mile range, that could tow over 30,000 pounds&#160;&#8212;&#160;and carry almost 8,000 pounds in its 8 foot bed&#160;&#8212;&#160;with ease. Speaking of beds, Tesla claim of 6.5 feet also bothers me:</li>
</ul>
<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/Cybertruck_empty.jpg' alt='Tesla Cybertruck True Bed Dimensions' title='Tesla Cybertruck True Bed Dimensions' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>Given that Tesla appears to have built the Cyberquad from a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/31175/it-looks-like-the-tesla-cyberquad-atv-is-actually-a-yamaha-raptor-underneath">Yamaha Raptor</a>, which comes in at 72.6" long, I bet the <em>usable</em> bed space comes in closer to six feet&#160;&#8212;&#160;not six and a half. The Cyberquad just fits:</p>

<div class='image'><img src='https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/08_Desktop.jpg' alt='Tesla Cybertruck with Cyberquad' title='Tesla Cybertruck with Cyberquad' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>The Cybertruck looks cool, but has little going for it beyond that. It&#8217;s a truck with near-sportscar-level performance, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk">but it&#8217;s not a very good sportscar</a>, and it&#8217;s not a very good truck. As a vehicle, then, it just doesn&#8217;t interest me, for these reasons and those cited above; as a toe in the waters of a sea change, though, the garishly named Cybertruck does give me hope for a more angular future.</p>

<p>I despise <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8762373/car-design-curves">curvy cars</a>. I just want a box on wheels, like a classic Toyota Land Cruiser or Land Rover Defender. Aside from a Jepp Wrangler, I got as close to that as I could with <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/choosing-an-adventure-rig.html">my Toyota 4Runner</a>. I also have no love for the fragility of modern cars. I understand the reasons for large crumple zones and lightweight materials, but delicate trim pieces degrade over time&#160;&#8212;&#160;often quickly, and seldom well. Perhaps the Cybertruck&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/24/20980141/tesla-cybertruck-preorder-deposit-elon-musk">apparent</a> popularity will encourage an automaker to try something new. Besides looking good and making me happy, a Cybertruck-like design would also <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing">slash production costs</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;a <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/08176b5a-ca96-4b82-bd15-336295ec7d14">win, win, win</a>. Tesla did something good with the Cybertruck, but it did not do it well. The fact that anyone did it at all, though, does give me hope.</p>
