                    <p>A few weeks ago I put the finishing touches on <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/a-crying-shame.html"><em>A Crying Shame</em></a>. Rather than posting the article here though I submitted it to Marco Arment&#8217;s The Magazine for consideration in a future issue, hoping to one day open the app and find my own words alongside the work of those I hold in high esteem. Within a few days I received a brief response from The Magazine&#8217;s executive editor Glenn Fleishman requesting more information, and I sent him the entire piece.

                    <p>Late last week, as the temperature continued to drop outside my hotel room on a characteristically cold Duluth night, my phone vibrated. Slightly apprehensive, I opened my email to find another brief message. Stripping the obligatory courtesies out, Glenn Fleishman&#8217;s email rejecting my article from The Magazine read as follows:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for work that&#8217;s less philosophical and 10,000-foot view and more rooted in narrative: a good beginning, middle, and end with growth along the way.&#8221;</p>
                    <p></p>
                    </blockquote>
<p>To say I was crushed would be a vast overstatement: the possibility of such a turn of events had always existed in my mind, and the rejection did not come as a particular surprise; to say that I was disappointed, however, would be an understatement. I was not so much disappointed that my piece had been rejected though, but because I expected so much more from The Magazine: I expected to walk away from this experience, regardless of the outcome, inspired to create better content more often; instead, I found a publication imposing the same restrictions my teachers force me to adhere to. This shining example of what I once considered real writing&#160;&#8212;&#160;the important writing, the stuff that actually mattered&#160;&#8212;&#160;had suddenly performed an about-face, turned to me, and shoved the same criteria my English teachers force upon me in my face; and I recoiled violently, disappointed and disgusted.</p>
