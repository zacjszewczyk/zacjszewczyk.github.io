<p>Last week, amidst the frenzy preluding Apple&#8217;s impending iPhone event, I posted an article titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/intapaper-5.html"><em>Instapaper 5</em></a>. I did not have early access to a beta or any insight as to the direction Betaworks planned on taking the service; instead, I merely wished to put forth a possible launch strategy for the upcoming update and outline a number of improvements I had been considering. I posted the article with minor expectations, thinking it would attract the usual eight to twelve pageviews; what came next took me completely by surprise.</p>

<p>Four days later, completely out of the blue, I unlocked my phone to find that I had an unread Twitter mention. Someone named Brian Donohue had read and enjoyed my article, it seemed; I was flattered. Later, when I remembered to open Tweetbot and actually read the message, I was surprised to see that he wished to speak with me. On the phone. Who does that anymore? But his request had piqued my interest, and I agreed.</p>

<p>We set up a call for Sunday afternoon. When the time came to finally dial Brian&#8217;s number, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel slightly apprehensive. I had climbed atop a lofty pedestal and presumed to tell this large software company all the ways in which they had failed, after all; who was I to speak with any authority? I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, so when Brian nonchalantly answered the phone after a few rings I did my best to present a calm and collected facade.</p>

<p>Ironically, just then the call dropped.</p>

<p>After reestablishing the connection, Brian picked right back up where we had left off. Over the next half hour we talked about Instapaper, its website, and the iOS app; about my article, how much he had enjoyed it, and how the &#8220;higher-ups at Betaworks&#8221; found it interesting as well; and most importantly, we talked about the direction Betaworks had Instapaper heading in: design decisions, where the company&#8217;s focus lies, and the avenues Instapaper&#8217;s developers were actively exploring. And then, as if all this&#160;&#8212;&#160;details and anecdotes<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I would have expected out of an Instapaper tell-all book that will never get written&#160;&#8212;&#160;was not enough, Brian offered me access to the beta.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t say &#8220;Yes&#8221; fast enough.</p>

<p>The entire interaction&#160;&#8212;&#160;some of which I have chronicled above, and some of which I have left out; the more significant portion, however, I have refrained from sharing just yet&#160;&#8212;&#160;gave me an incredible feeling of gratitude towards Brian in particular as the one who had reached out to me, but Betaworks as well for giving him the green-light to bring me into the loop. Brian could have left it at that: after taking the time to talk about Instapaper and then giving me access to the beta, I could not have asked for more. A few minutes after our call ended though, I got a cheery email from Brian with credentials to the beta and then, at the end, an offer I still have a hard time believing: citing two particular lines of my blog post, Brian offered to add a feature to Instapaper for me. In my response, I struggled against the urge to proclaim my eternal gratitude should he choose to implement it.</p>

<p>After all this, how could I not feel indebted to Brian and, by extension, Betaworks? He had gone above and beyond the call of duty in offering to add a feature to one of my favorite apps, and asked for nothing in return. After all this, I wanted to do something in return. Specifically, I wanted to show my gratitude by doing the thing I do best: write, and write positive things about Betaworks and its products. And just as that thought went through my mind, it finally clicked: I finally understood why people accuse John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple of coloring their opinions concerning Apple. When a seemingly faceless corporation reaches out, it&#8217;s hard not to feel indebted to them, just as I felt a great debt of gratitude towards Brian and Betaworks as I imagine so, too, did Jim Dalrymple and John Gruber once upon a time. Experience and time allowed them to temper that emotion, however, as I must now temper the same sentiment in my own writing concerning Instapaper in the coming weeks and months.</p>
