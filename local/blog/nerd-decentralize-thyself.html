<p>Back in April <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/email-list-and-rss.html">I linked to</a> Rich Stevens&#8217; <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=928">announcement</a> of a new newsletter he planned to begin publishing once or twice a week focusing on &#8220;A little business, a little gadgetry, a little art and writing, and a few dick jokes.&#8221; Since then I have enjoyed his seventeen posts immensely, and the latest was no exception: in <em>Nerd, Decentralize Thyself</em><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Rich Stevens spoke to the recent trend towards relying on platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter, and how despite liking both he would never forfeit ownership of his website.

                    <p>Personally, I could not agree more: I love Squarespace and Tumblr has a great thing going for it, but I want to be the one responsible for my Markdown parser failing to recognizing a link. I like downloading my web.config file so that I can mess it up for half an hour. If I feel like changing how readers view footnotes, then by God <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/changes-to-first-crack.html">I will</a>. Running this sort of website has a much higher barrier to entry, but it also brings with it a much greater reward. Just as not everyone can handle working from home, I cannot in good conscience say that everyone should go write their own CMS; however, once you experience the benefits of doing so, you will never want to go back.</p>
