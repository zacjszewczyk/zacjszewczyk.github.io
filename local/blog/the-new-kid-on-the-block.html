<p>Since its debut yesterday virtually everyone has lauded Apple for introducing the iPhone 5C. (I refuse to acknowledge Apple&#8217;s ridiculous naming convention; 5c? Please. If I wanted to look like a five year old I could forget to proofread my articles on my own. And I&#8217;m not the only one miffed at Apple&#8217;s new standard: Lex Friedman, in a tweet yesterday: &#8220;If Apple is lowercasing the S and C..., I&#8217;m going to start capitalizing the &#8221;i&#8220;: IPhone 5s. That&#8217;s better.&#8221;) Hailed as the elusive midrange offering from a traditionally high-end company, Apple received great praise over a move many see as a way to increase device sales by capturing the low end. I have a number of issues with that sentiment.</p>

<p>In an article from June titled <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/apples-wildcard.html"><em>Apple&#8217;s Wildcard</em></a>, I questioned the existence of a market Apple could address with a budget iPhone. I reasoned that between latest model, last year&#8217;s offering, and the iPod Touch, no middle ground existed which a cheaper iPhone could occupy. After nearly three more weeks of 5C rumors though, I tempered my initial thoughts in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-halfway-phone.html"><em>The Halfway Phone</em></a>, where instead of denying the existence of such a market, I put forth the hope that Apple would avoid it. Two months later, as I followed along with The Verge&#8217;s live stream of the press event, I was not disappointed when Apple released a marketing gimmick called the IPhone 5c.</p>

<p>Throughout its life in the Apple rumor mill, speculators tried to strike a balance between predicting a phone cheap enough to attract a low end somehow not addressed by Apple&#8217;s existing strategy and imagining a device too expensive to justify its existence alongside the flagship offering. With Apple&#8217;s current portfolio placing the newest model at $650 unsubsidized and $199 on a two-year contract, last year&#8217;s option at $550 and $99 respectively, and the previous year&#8217;s offering on sale for $450 and $0, Apple had two options: price a phone at or around $350 unsubsidized, thereby creating the budget iPhone necessary to enter markets the other models&#8217; price points prohibited, or replace one of its existing tiers. Apple chose the latter route, deigning to give its existing customer base a &#8220;new&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I use the word lightly here&#160;&#8212;&#160;option to consider rather than trying to compete on the low-end.</p>

<p>Rather than follow the established trend, wherein Apple shifts its mobile lineup to contain the latest model on top, last year&#8217;s device in the middle, and the year prior&#8217;s phone at the &#8220;low-end&#8221;, Apple chose to make a slight addendum in the form of the 5C. With the 5S marketed as Apple&#8217;s premium offering and the 4S now free with contract, instead of placing the 5 as the midrange offering Apple took that device&#8217;s components, repackaged them in a brightly-colored case, and turned the resulting device into a new category: the &#8220;iPhone 5c [sic]&#8221;. From a technical perspective, the actual product line changed almost imperceptibly with the advent of the &#8220;new&#8221; offering; had Apple forgone the 5C, it would have sold the same three devices, albeit with slightly less color. Not only the same phones from a technical standpoint, but from a pricing one as well: as always, the latest model retails for $649 unsubsidized, and $199 on a two-year contract. The iPhone 5C, replacing the iPhone 5, sells for $549 and $99, respectively, while the 4S comes in at $449 and $0. This should sound familiar; Apple follows this pattern every year, and this year brought no surprises.</p>

<p>Many explain the advent of the 5C as Apple combatting stigma against old phones. As of September twentieth, those purchasing an iPhone but unwilling to pay a premium do not have to settle for last year&#8217;s technology. Or so the reasoning goes, but I can&#8217;t help but consider this, too, a flawed strategy. The first data point in what will likely become a trend shows that with each new model, last year&#8217;s high-end components get repackaged in to that year&#8217;s version of the 5C. Next year, when Apple announces the iPhone 6, the 6C will likely be nothing more interesting than the 5S&#8217;s internals ported to those colorful shells. Some may argue that the 6C will contain lesser versions of the 6&#8217;s components, but that is the very function Apple&#8217;s existing strategy serves. Further, shifting the product line with each successive iPhone launch gives manufacturing setups increased longevity and thus yield greater profits, a benefit this approach would destroy as with each release Apple would be forced to modify its manufacturing process yet again.</p>

<p>If not as a technical boon, a strategy to capture the low end, or a manner through which to combat a perceived stigma against older devices, why did Apple launch the 5C as a new brand? I believe Benedict Evans said it best in <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/377855886594953216">a tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Posit: yesterday Apple cut the price of the iPhone by $100, at same margin, and made it cooler. Also launched entirely new high-end phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict made his point very clear, but for the <a href="http://curiousrat.com/apples-low-cost-fairytale">dimwits</a> I will elaborate. Essentially, and I hinted at this earlier, the 5C is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. After bumping the 5 down a price tier as was expected, Apple simultaneously raised its margins on the device and made it massively more appealing to the mass market. The company will go on to sell <em>droves</em> of this model, and with even greater margins than before, it will make a <em>ton</em> of money.  Therein lies the genius of this approach, and the reason Apple went to all the trouble to create this additional product category. The people who will buy a 5S knew they wanted that phone as soon as Tim Cook announced it; the 5C is decidedly not for them. For everyone else though, those deciding between a 5, 4S, or an Android phone, Apple took away any lingering uncertainty with the 5C.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just before I finished this article, I came across Tom Warren&#8217;s piece on The Verge titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4716286/iphone-5c-not-a-cheap-iphone-just-colorful"><em>The iPhone 5c isn&#8217;t a cheap iPhone, it&#8217;s just a colorful one</em></a> in which he makes most of the same points I did here and a few others to boot. If you found this post at all interesting, I strongly recommend checking his out as well.</p>
