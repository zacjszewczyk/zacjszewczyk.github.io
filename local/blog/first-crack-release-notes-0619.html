<p>Since <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">re-releasing First Crack</a>, I have made some great progress on the project. Not enough for version 2.0, though, so I spent the last few days thinking about how I wanted to post new versions. In short, I decided not to.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">Traditional software versioning</a> implies a cycle of feature integration&#160;&#8212;&#160;feedback&#160;&#8212;&#160;improvement that I neither have the user base nor the inclination to do. I also don&#8217;t want to take such a formal approach to a hobby I work on in my spare time. I still want to talk about improvements, so instead of versions, I plan to post monthly release notes for First Crack. This series will serve as a written record of the changes I make and the thought process behind them, as well as a good way for those interested in the project to keep up with it.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="JuneActivity">June Activity<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JuneActivity">#</a></span></h2>

<p>First, the changes I made in June. These are now live at <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack-Public">Github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zjszewczyk/firstcrack-public/src/master/">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublicRelease">Public Release<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublicRelease">#</a></span></h3>

<p>It took me a long time to <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/re-introducing-first-crack.html">re-releases First Crack</a>, but I finally did it. This new version does more, builds a more feature-rich website, and implements a larger subset of the Markdown spec. It now has the versatility and polish a public project should, unlike <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack">its predecessor</a>. This release was long overdue, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;I think&#160;&#8212;&#160;worth the wait.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="Python3Migration">Python 3 Migration<span>&nbsp;<a href="#Python3Migration">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I started writing First Crack in 2012, with Python 2; I ported it to Python 3 in June. This involved swapping a few <code>print</code> statements with the new <code>print()</code> functions.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="CannedPrettyPrint">Canned "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#CannedPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I believe in generating valid HTML files that also look good: the former because I care about being a good programmer, and the latter because it makes debugging easier. First Crack still builds valid HTML files, but I canned &#8220;pretty print&#8221;. It created too many problems with <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> blocks that I could not solve with the old Markdown parser. I plan to revisit this once I work out the kinks in the new one.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="StatefulMarkdownParser">Stateful Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#StatefulMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Ahead of First Crack&#8217;s re-release, I identified the Markdown parser as the oldest, hackiest part of the code base. As the least optimized, most called method in the project, re-writing it seemed like a great idea. This had the potential to have a huge positive impact, and so I set out with a few goals in mind. I wanted to build a more reliable parser, less susceptible to weird edge cases, that implemented more of the Markdown spec. This would mean more overhead, so I also wanted the method to stay fast. I set out to do this over the next few months, but ended up finishing it a couple days later. The new version met each of my goals, and runs about 25% faster than its predecessor. I plan to release it as its own project soon.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ImprovedDocumentation">Improved Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ImprovedDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I made the last change in June to First Crack&#8217;s documentation. In particular, I spent some time fleshing out <a href="https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/Standalone-FirstCrack">the README</a>, with the goal of doing a better job explaining the aspects that make my project great. I settled on four short bullet points on First Crack&#8217;s front- and back-end features. I now highlight the project&#8217;s strengths right at the start: a lightweight, full-featured, beautiful blog with a custom landing page, and a fast, easy to use, platform-agnostic engine to build it.</p>

<h2 class="headers" id="JulyPlan">July Plan<span>&nbsp;<a href="#JulyPlan">#</a></span></h2>

<p>Going forward, I plan to focus my efforts on these areas in July, 2019.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReImplementPrettyPrint">Re-Implement "Pretty Print"<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReImplementPrettyPrint">#</a></span></h3>

<p>See above, but in brief: now that First Crack uses a stateful Markdown parser, I would like to re-implement the &#8220;pretty print&#8221; feature I canned before the re-write. I like reading well-formatted HTML.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="ReleaseMarkdownParser">Release Markdown Parser<span>&nbsp;<a href="#ReleaseMarkdownParser">#</a></span></h3>

<p>Speaking of the new Markdown parser, I would also like to release it as its own project in July. Usage would look like this:</p>

<pre>
$ python3
>>> import Markdown
>>> md = Markdown()
>>>
>>> raw_markdown = "Hi, **this** is a sentence with a [link](https://google.com) to *Google*."
>>>
>>> print(md.html(raw_markdown))
Hi, <strong>this</strong> is a sentence with a <a href="https://google.com">link</a> to <em>Google</em>.
</pre>

<p>Before I can do that, though, I have a few bugs to work out with the Markdown implementation, and I would like to enable parsing multi-line strings and entire files at once. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">Publish Implementation of Markdown Spec<span>&nbsp;<a href="#PublishImplementationofMarkdownSpec">#</a></span></h3>

<p>There are some peculiarities to my implementation of the Markdown spec, so I want to outline those differences in a formal document. I picture something similar to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text">the original Markdown syntax document on Daringfireball</a>.</p>

<h3 class="headers" id="GuidedSetup">Guided Setup<span>&nbsp;<a href="#GuidedSetup">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I would also like to add a guided setup to my project. Right now, First Crack forces the user to fill out a config file before it builds their website. I would like to make this a guided process, where First Crack asks the user questions and builds that config file itself. At this stage, I want to focus on lowering the barrier to entry for a new user, and making First Crack more attractive. </p>

<h3 class="headers" id="BetterDocumentation">Better Documentation<span>&nbsp;<a href="#BetterDocumentation">#</a></span></h3>

<p>I did a lot to improve First Crack&#8217;s documentation in June, but I will always have more work in this area. That will look like more robust comments in the scripts, but I want to focus on the README. As the first document most people will read about the project, I want to make it compelling, informative, and fun. I have a few broad ideas going into this, based on good examples from other projects:</p>

<ul>
    <li>GIFs of the install and run process that show simplicity, ease, and speed.</li>
<li>Performance graphs of First Crack&#8217;s back-end performance versus other, similar engines. At less than two seconds to build a website of over one thousand pages, </li>
<li>Performance graphs of the web pages First Crack builds versus the pages common content management systems build. </li>
<li>Screenshots. This site is a live demo of the engine, but I like the idea of having a few pictures in there, too. </li>
</ul>
<p>I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I look forward to it.</p>
