<p>Nikita Prokopov, on the growing complexity of software and the shrinking number of people who understand it:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what&#8217;s going on down the stack. ... Docker and Electron are the most hyped new technologies of the last five years. Both are not about improving things, figuring out complexity or reducing it. Both are just compromised attempts to hide accumulated complexity from developers because it became impossible to deal with.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw this in college, when even Computer Science students favored complex and bloated frameworks over their own code. I make a concerted effort to counter it in my own projects: <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>, the custom blog engine behind this site, uses vanilla Python 2 or 3 and has no dependencies. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">If you</a> decide <a href="https://johnkurkowski.com/posts/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-program-but-come-back-in-10-years/">to code</a>, <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/no-such-thing-as-knowing-coding-all-the-way-to-the-bottom/">you don&#8217;t have to start with C</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;but you should learn it. I resisted this during college, but two years into my career, I have come around: the lower you go, the better you will understand things higher in the stack. With greater understanding comes an increased ability to influence those things, which, in turn, will make you better at your job.</p>

<p>Michal Charemza brought up another good point in <a href="https://charemza.name/blog/posts/abstractions/http/http-guide-for-developers/"><em>Mini HTTP guide for developers</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Frameworks often hide/abstract parts of HTTP away. I think this is often a bit of a shame: it hides what&#8217;s possible with HTTP, and so can lead to effects on engineering decisions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By learning to use frameworks instead of the tools and protocols they implement, developers not only miss out on foundational knowledge that will help them become better at their job, but also hamstring themselves to the subset of features the frameworks’ creators’ felt important enough to enable. Expanding a project beyond that expected use case will require diving into those low-level tools and protocol—-which, again, you do not have to start with, but you should learn at some point.</p>

I thought a lot about getting <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">an RV</a> instead of my first house, but this pushed me away from buying an RV then and ensured that when I do decide to go that route, <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">I will build it myself</a>.</p>

<p>Jeff Huang, echoing a point I made in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html"><em>Own Your Platform</em></a>, in his piece on the importance of building websites that stand the test of time:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve recommended my students to push websites to Heroku, and publish portfolios on Wix. Yet every platform with irreplaceable content dies off some day. Geocities, LiveJournal, what.cd, now Yahoo Groups. One day, Medium, Twitter, and even hosting services like GitHub Pages will be plundered then discarded when they can no longer grow or cannot find a working business model.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, later, he echoes a point I made in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-own-your-platform.html"><em>How to Own Your Platform</em></a>, about the vulnerable position relying on trendy third-party frameworks puts you in: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;... a growing set of libraries and frameworks are making the web more sophisticated but also more complex. First came jquery, then bootstrap, npm, angular, grunt, webpack, and more. If you are a web developer who is keeping up with the latest, then that&#8217;s not a problem. But if not, maybe you are an embedded systems programmer or startup CTO or enterprise Java developer or chemistry PhD student, sure you could probably figure out how to set up some web server and toolchain, but will you keep this up year after year, decade after decade? Probably not, and when the next year when you encounter a package dependency problem or figure out how to regenerate your html files, you might just throw your hands up and zip up the files to deal with &#8216;later&#8217;. Even simple technology stacks like static site generators (e.g., Jekyll) require a workflow and will stop working at some point. You fall into npm dependency hell, and forget the command to package a release.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run your website, and <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">own the production stack</a>. Jeff has some some good ideas, but do not paper over poor back-end design with good front-end work. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">Own your platform</a>, so that you can ensure both will stand the test of time.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at an inflection point today in the idea of space being developed as its own domain. When you look at the threats that we have today, there&#8217;s some similarity to what we had in the &#8216;80s. That waned in the &#8217;90s and that led us to the idea of space as an uncontested area, so we designed space architecture based off the fact that we wouldn&#8217;t really be threatened in space. Today you&#8217;ve got a pretty much more aggressive threat. So that space area of operations is the area that we focus on for protecting and defending critical assets as we look at the growing threat from our adversaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason Fenske does a nice job explaining why the Cybertruck will not tow well: high efficiency gives electric vehicles competitive ranges despite their batteries&#8217; low energy capacity, but also means that even a light, 5,000 pound trailer will slash that figure. In <code>distance = energy / force</code>, a small numerator (low capacity) causes range to drop off much faster as the denominator (towed weight) increases. See the blue graph below, which depicts range (the y-axis) as a function of towed weight (the x-axis). Traditional vehicles, although less efficient, have vast energy stores; in their case, a high numerator means the denominator has much less of an impact as it increases. See this in the green graph.</p>

<div class='image'><img src='/assets/Images/force_graph.png' alt='Force graph with a high versus low numerator' title='Force graph with a high versus low numerator' loading='lazy' /></div>

<p>As I said about the Cybertruck <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tesla-cybertruck.html">last week</a>, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a very good sportscar, and it&#8217;s not a very good truck.&#8221; I <a href="/blog/expedition-rigs.html#Electric">still think electric vehicles will revolutionize the overland space</a>, but it will take years for the batteries to get there.</p>

<p>I often <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-mornings-reads.html">see articles</a> that I would like to talk about, but that I do not feel warrant a whole post here.

<p>I spent the morning reading hot takes on Tesla&#8217;s new Cybertruck. I have some more thinking to do, but <a href="https://jalopnik.com/a-deep-look-at-the-design-of-tesla-s-cybertruck-1839993654">Jason Torchinsky</a> wrote a great post on the truck&#8217;s design, and <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing">Kim Reynolds</a> did a nice job approaching the topic from a manufacturing standpoint. <a href="https://jalopnik.com/how-the-tesla-cybertruck-hypothetically-measures-up-to-1839993925">Andrew Collins</a> also has a nice comparison of the Cybertruck versus some of its competitors, which is beats on all fronts.</p>

<p>I have a few things to say here, so let me say them all up front. Your diet doesn&#8217;t matter. Your training plan doesn&#8217;t matter. The reason you will never reach your goal is because you don&#8217;t want to. You don&#8217;t work hard enough to achieve it, and nowhere near hard enough for anything like a diet or training plan to make a difference. Those factors come into play at such a high level, one so far from where you are now, that all the time and effort you pour into these areas is wasted. Now let me explain.  </p>

<p>Avdi Grimm wrote an interesting post back in June, about <a href="https://avdi.codes/tools-for-turning-descriptions-into-diagrams/">using text to create simple diagrams</a>. He highlighted a few different tools, but one stood out: <a href="http://www.nomnoml.com/">nomnoml</a>. I used <a href="https://www.umlet.com/">UMLet</a> a lot back in college, to create some mediocre user stories, which soured me on UML in general. I gave nomnoml a shot, though, and created this simple network diagram:</p>

<p>At home, I can send a link from any device to a local web server that saves it for later. Then, when I have time to read, I can see all my saved articles, move them into folders, and refer back to them as needed. At work, though, those links go into a text file. When I get home, I find the text file, open it, copy the list, clear the file, close it, and then send the list to the server. <code>pbcopy</code> makes that process just a little easier. Now, <code>cat ingest.txt &gt; pbcophy &#38; echo "" &gt; ingest.txt</code> puts the contents of <code>ingest.txt</code> on my clipboard and then clears the file, so I can add the links through the web interface with just a bit less hassle.</p>

<p>The Economist took an interesting look at how citizens view politicians when they lie, and their conclusion warrants concern: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;You might expect (or hope) that thoughtful people would be more amenable to the force of fact-based evidence than most. Alas, no. According to David Perkins of Harvard University, the brighter people are, the more deftly they can conjure up post-hoc justifications for arguments that back their own side.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads well into a point Ryan Holiday made back in March, in <a href="https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1"><em>It&#8217;s Not Enough to Be Right&#160;&#8212;&#160;You Also Have to Be Kind</em></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;There is this unshakeable assumption that if they can just present the right fact[, ...] that people will change their minds. ... After spending years and millions of words and hours of video on this, we&#8217;ve had almost zero success. Why? Because you can&#8217;t reason people out of positions they didn&#8217;t reason themselves into. No one responds well to having their identity attacked. No argument made in bad faith&#160;&#8212;&#160;that the person on the other side is a moron or a dupe or a racist or a snowflake&#160;&#8212;&#160;is ever going to be received in good faith.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sooner this becomes not just common knowledge, but also common practice, the sooner we can move beyond petty divisions and focus on <a href="https://dchhaddendum.libsyn.com/ep7-hardcore-history-on-fire">steering the empire from total collapse</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick O&#8217;Neill did <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614646/inside-the-microsoft-team-tracking-the-worlds-most-dangerous-hackers/">a nice job</a> explaining why Microsoft, as an organization, does threat intelligence so well. Yes, it has piles of money and legions of smart people to throw at this problem, but Microsoft&#8217;s biggest leg up over everyone else is the massive data flow its ubiquity enables. This means its Threat Intelligence Center sees things no one else does, and has the context to identify malicious activity that&#160;&#8212;&#160;even given the same raw data&#160;&#8212;&#160;no one else would know to flag. Those looking to step into the cybersecurity realm, even if just to beef up their home network, should take note. </p>
