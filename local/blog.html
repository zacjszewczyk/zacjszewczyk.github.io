<p>A few days late, again, but here it is: First Crack&#8217;s release notes for November, 2019. Again in October, like <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/first-crack-release-notes-0919.html">in September</a>, I spent most of my dev time on an Instapaper-like read later service. I use it every day, and plan to release it. I did get a couple things done, though; once again, I did not neglect <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> entirely.</p>

<p>I like to think about things. To riff off <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/start-before-you-think-youre-ready.html">Austin Kleon</a>, I want to become a professional writer so that I can be a professional thinker.

I have sat down today to talk about Tesla&#8217;s new Cybertruck&#160;&#8212;&#160;not because the Internet needs <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/hot-takes-on-teslas-cybertruck.html">one more hot take</a>, but rather to pursue those goals.</p>

<p>I like this post a lot, and the idea even more: Noah Gibbs lays out some good reasons to encourage a culture of blogging within an organization, and solid strategies for getting started. My boss floated an idea like this a few weeks ago, and while I had my doubts at first, time&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this piece&#160;&#8212;&#160;have changed my mind. More to follow.</p>

<p>I have a few things to say here, so let me say them all up front. Your diet doesn&#8217;t matter. Your training plan doesn&#8217;t matter. The reason you will never reach your goal is because you don&#8217;t want to. You don&#8217;t work hard enough to achieve it, and nowhere near hard enough for anything like a diet or training plan to make a difference. Those factors come into play at such a high level, one so far from where you are now, that all the time and effort you pour into these areas is wasted. Now let me explain.  </p>

<p>Avdi Grimm wrote an interesting post back in June, about <a href="https://avdi.codes/tools-for-turning-descriptions-into-diagrams/">using text to create simple diagrams</a>. He highlighted a few different tools, but one stood out: <a href="http://www.nomnoml.com/">nomnoml</a>. I used <a href="https://www.umlet.com/">UMLet</a> a lot back in college, to create some mediocre user stories, which soured me on UML in general. I gave nomnoml a shot, though, and created this simple network diagram:</p>

<p>At home, I can send a link from any device to a local web server that saves it for later. Then, when I have time to read, I can see all my saved articles, move them into folders, and refer back to them as needed. At work, though, those links go into a text file. When I get home, I find the text file, open it, copy the list, clear the file, close it, and then send the list to the server. <code>pbcopy</code> makes that process just a little easier. Now, <code>cat ingest.txt &gt; pbcophy &#38; echo "" &gt; ingest.txt</code> puts the contents of <code>ingest.txt</code> on my clipboard and then clears the file, so I can add the links through the web interface with just a bit less hassle.</p>

<p>The Economist took an interesting look at how citizens view politicians when they lie, and their conclusion warrants concern: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;You might expect (or hope) that thoughtful people would be more amenable to the force of fact-based evidence than most. Alas, no. According to David Perkins of Harvard University, the brighter people are, the more deftly they can conjure up post-hoc justifications for arguments that back their own side.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads well into a point Ryan Holiday made back in March, in <a href="https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1"><em>It&#8217;s Not Enough to Be Right&#160;&#8212;&#160;You Also Have to Be Kind</em></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;There is this unshakeable assumption that if they can just present the right fact[, ...] that people will change their minds. ... After spending years and millions of words and hours of video on this, we&#8217;ve had almost zero success. Why? Because you can&#8217;t reason people out of positions they didn&#8217;t reason themselves into. No one responds well to having their identity attacked. No argument made in bad faith&#160;&#8212;&#160;that the person on the other side is a moron or a dupe or a racist or a snowflake&#160;&#8212;&#160;is ever going to be received in good faith.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sooner this becomes not just common knowledge, but also common practice, the sooner we can move beyond petty divisions and focus on <a href="https://dchhaddendum.libsyn.com/ep7-hardcore-history-on-fire">steering the empire from total collapse</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick O&#8217;Neill did <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614646/inside-the-microsoft-team-tracking-the-worlds-most-dangerous-hackers/">a nice job</a> explaining why Microsoft, as an organization, does threat intelligence so well. Yes, it has piles of money and legions of smart people to throw at this problem, but Microsoft&#8217;s biggest leg up over everyone else is the massive data flow its ubiquity enables. This means its Threat Intelligence Center sees things no one else does, and has the context to identify malicious activity that&#160;&#8212;&#160;even given the same raw data&#160;&#8212;&#160;no one else would know to flag.

I use it every day, and plan to release it sometime soon. I did get a couple things done, though; once again, I did not neglect <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> entirely.</p>

<p>Ben Thompson, likening Facebook to the printing press:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“... the printing press effectively overthrew the First Estate, leading to the establishment of nation-states and the creation and empowerment of a new nobility[, the Second Estate]. The implication of overthrowing the Second Estate, via the empowerment of commoners[, the Third Estate], is almost too radical to imagine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">A fascinating perspective</a>. The First Estate did not lose control without a fight&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a great deal of complaining&#160;&#8212;&#160;and it seems the Second Estate will follow suit. Ben made this point back in 2016 in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/"><em>The Voters Decide</em></a>, but did a much better job in here.</p>

<p>Since this has become a politics-adjacent post, I have found Mathew Stoller&#8217;s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/">BIG newsletter</a> quite interesting over the last few weeks, too.

<p>Jason and Nikki Wynn wrote a fantastic article that explains how they get Internet access on their sailboat. I spend a lot of time thinking about this, as I prepare to one day build and live in <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">my own RV</a>. I have an article in the works that outlines a few different approaches, as well as my own plan. In brief, though, I plan to use a dedicated LTE modem for my primary connection, with a satellite link as a fallback. This will give me a stronger connection than a cellphone, hotspot, or even the oft-cited WeBoost in most of the Americas. On the off-chance I have no signal but need one, satellite data prices have come down enough to make that a viable way to ensure I always have some sort of connectivity.</p>

<p>The &#8220;pound for pound&#8221; metric does a fine job of comparing two peoples&#8217; relative strength. It accounts for the difference between someone weighing in at 175 who deadlifts 585, and me weighing in at 220 who deadlifts the same. I have a lot of respect for that other guy. This metric does not trump absolute numbers, though. Argue all you want, but the pound for pound &#8220;stronger&#8221; person, who maxes out with weights someone else uses to warm up, is far weaker; that other guy&#8217;s max would break him. You may convince yourself that an arbitrary ratio makes them comparable, but the iron will crush that argument, too.</p>

<p>From Simon Pitt <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-death-of-the-computer-file-doc-43cb028c0506">over at OneZero</a>, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;The other day, I came across a website I&#8217;d written over two decades ago. I double-clicked the file, and it opened and ran perfectly. Then I tried to run a website I&#8217;d written 18 months ago and found I couldn&#8217;t run it without firing up a web server, and when I ran NPM install, one or two of those 65,000 files had issues that meant node failed to install them and the website didn&#8217;t run. When I did get it working, it needed a database. And then it relied on some third-party APIs and there was an issue with CORS because I hadn&#8217;t whitelisted localhost. My website made of files carried on, chugging along. <strong>This isn&#8217;t me saying that things were better in the old days. I&#8217;m just saying that years ago websites were made of files; now they are made of dependencies.</strong>&#8221;</p>

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do think things were better in the old days, <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">so I&#8217;ll stick to static files and vanilla Python for my projects</a>.</p>

<p>The first time I read through Steph Smith&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/"><em>Writing is Thinking: Learning to Write with Confidence</em></a>, I thought it was fine. Then I read it again. The second time, I thought it was great&#160;&#8212;&#160;an interesting breakdown of a much more mature writing process than my own, that gave me some good ideas for writing more and writing better. I have not done much writing about writing <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/before-now-and-future.html">since I started again</a>, but I hope to; maybe something like <a href="https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/">this</a>, about how Steph&#8217;s piece changes my process, will be my first.</p>

<p>I like to plan ahead, and so I think about long-term financial security even <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-8-income-portfolio.html">now</a>, in my early twenties. As the old saying goes, &#8220;The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&#8221; When I decide to retire, I will get to say I chose the first.</p>

<p>I have read a lot of Aaron and Jen&#8217;s work, but it took <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2401891/airstream-flying-cloud-tour">this video</a> to make me realize how nice they had it. Their Airstream-Silverado combo makes for a great setup, which made me re-think <a href="/projects.html#lmtvRV">my plan</a> to build an LMTV-based RV. With $40,000 for a used Airstream, though, plus another $30,000 for a used truck to pull it, I would spend more going this route and get a less capable setup. The M1083 will give me more living space atop a chassis that can go almost anywhere&#160;&#8212;&#160;and a trailer, no matter how slick, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/expedition-rigs.html">just can&#8217;t compete with that</a>.</p>
