Szewczyk</link> on <a href="blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="blog/2019-04.html">04</a>/25 16:24:44 EST</time><p>I found this article after <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/2016/07/22/making-obvious-fast.html"><em>Making the obvious code fast</em></a>, where Jack Mott explained the impact of ignoring basic optimization. In his 2016 piece <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/tools/editor/ide/visual/studio/2016/07/01/marginal-gains.html"><em>Marginal Gains</em></a>, he went over some small tips to make developers&#8217; lives easier. He had some good suggestions, and I want to take a minute to emphasize one of his points.</p><p><strong>Use the command line as much as possible, so that you can automate as much of your work as possible.</strong> Most programs wrap one or more command line tools. This helps non-technical people. Take out the middleman, though, learn to use the underlying tool, and then write a script to work for you. Automate the boring tasks, so that you can focus on the exciting ones, take on new roles, further your own education, or even start a side hustle.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time optimizing images for the web, for example, <a href="https://imageoptim.com/command-line.html">let the command line handle that</a>. Do you work with videos? <a href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.2.0/cli/command-line-reference.html">It can handle that, too</a>. If you spend hours scrolling through thousands of lines of log files, <a href="http://droptips.com/using-grep-to-exclude-lines-containing-certain-characterstext">why not save some time by taking out all traffic to the server from your developers&#8217; machines?</a> You cannot do everything with the command line, but you can free yourself from the boring in favor of more challenging and interesting work.</p></div>

An interesting piece, it reminded me of a great article Evan Ratlif wrote for Wired in 2009 titled <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/gone-forever-what-does-it-take-to-really-disappear/"><em>Gone Forever: What Does It Take to Really Disappear?</em></a>. I also rediscovered <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/evans-interview-with-matthew-sheppard-about-disappearing-its-like-dying/">the interview with Matt Sheppard</a> that Evan mentioned at the end of his article, as well as his follow-up piece where <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/author-evan-ratliff-is-on-the-lam-locate-him-and-win-5000/">he attempted to disappear and offered a $5,000 bounty for his sighting</a>. These articles sent me down a fascinating rabbit hole, into the world of faked deaths and mysterious disappearances. Some of the best pieces I found: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyj8a4/heres-the-best-way-to-fake-your-death"><em>Here&#8217;s the Best Way to Fake Your Death</em></a>, by Mack Lamoureux on Vice; <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/08/07/how-i-faked-my-own-death/"><em>How I faked my own death</em></a>, by Dean Balsimini on the New York Post; and <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2017-12-16-the-hardest-part-about-faking-your-own-death-is-staying-dead/"><em>The hardest part about faking your own death is staying dead</em></a> by Paige Nick on The New York Times Live. With Gerald Cotten&#8217;s sudden disappearance, we may have a recent example of this happening again. Trista Kelley has a good writeup over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quadriga-ceo-gerald-cotten-death-with-no-access-to-crypto-gets-weirder-2019-2">at Business Insider</a>. I find all of this fascinating.</p></div>

The scale and complexity make it impossible to analyze the code to look for new bugs, let alone efforts at sabotage. ... [and] the dirty secret is that most of the world&#8217;s computing infrastructure is a similar nightmare.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Two takeaways: 1) Choosing to use Huawei does not mean choosing to invite the Chinese government into a network. United States intelligence agencies have on-demand access to these networks; do not be so naive to believe other nations refrained from using similar tactics to the same results. And 2) 5G may not live up to all the hype. Even if it does, improving 4G infrastructure as AT&#38;T did with its 5GE network may shrink that delta to the point where the risk does not outweigh the benefit.</p></div>

They make a good case in this interesting article on The New York Times, and I even found a few gems in the comments section&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of which pointed me to a piece on Bloomberg.

As they point out in The New York Times&#8217; piece, though, it comes down to using a scary solution to avoid the guaranteed disaster that lies at the end of the path we walk today. If the science works out, we will have to choose between the devil we know, and the imagined one we have built up in our minds over the last half century.

I have no interest in focusing on the Green New Deal anyway, but rather on the data opposing the notion that the United States must cut its emissions to save the world. <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/SY/SY18/20170228/105632/HHRG-115-SY18-Wstate-DayaratnaK-20170228.pdf">The research does not agree</a>.</p><p>I have more reading to post on the subject of climate change, but I will save it for another day.</p></div>

As that article grew from a brief comment into a more in-depth rundown of the U.S.-Huawei situation, though, I pulled Herb Lin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk"><em>Huawei and Managing 5G Risk</em></a> out for its own post.</p><p>Where the five articles I linked to <a href="http://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">last time</a> focused on this situation at a high level, Herb Lin delves into the technical arguments for and against Huawei&#8217;s adoption by the West. As it turns out, the decision to adopt or blacklist the company comes down to a much more complicated risk-benefit analysis, even if conclusive evidence linking it to the Chinese government surfaces. <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/keeping-huawei-hardware-out-us-not-enough-secure-5g">Tom Wheeler and Robert Williams agree</a>.

French involvement in the Revolutionary War, anyone? <a href="https://www.rbth.com/history/329015-top-3-unknown-proxy-wars">Little has changed a century and a half later</a>. We still see this going on <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/05/proxy-wars-are-never-moral/">today</a> in <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-states-are-turning-proxy-war-29677">Syria</a>, to name just one recent example. We also see this going on today in the fifth domain&#160;&#8212;&#160;cyberspace&#160;&#8212;&#160;with <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/03/the-improbable-rise-of-huawei-5g-global-network-china/">the rise of the Chinese firm Huawei</a>. Although some experts <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/07/we-cant-tell-if-chinese-firms-work-for-the-party/">argue that the Communist Party does not control it</a>, <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-foreign-power-or-agent-foreign-power-under-fisa-insights-sanctions-case">recent Justice Department actions paint a different picture</a>, and those who would know <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-former-military-and-intelligence-officials-letter-5g-risks">believe that the Party does</a>. Regardless of that speculation, though, none argue that the company owes its fantastic success&#160;&#8212;&#160;at least in part&#160;&#8212;&#160;to the tremendous support of the Chinese government. Those ties have caused the United States&#8217; government to array itself against Huawei, which will <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/05/in-trumps-economy-the-invisible-hand-belongs-to-the-government/">likely translate into direct support</a> for its competitors.</p>

I wanted to take a second to drop a link to Mozilla&#8217;s new project, <a href="http://send.firefox.com">Firefox Send</a>. This service promises free, private, end-to-end encrypted, and temporary file transfers from a respected company with a stated desire to preserve its users privacy. Check out the release notes <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/03/12/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private/">here</a>. Also of interest, <a href="https://transfer.pcloud.com/">pCloud Transfer</a> allows anonymous users to send encrypted, password-protected files, too; pCould Transfer doubles the max file size of Firefox Send, though, but that comes at the price of some neat features that keep Mozilla&#8217;s new project in the running for me.</p>

I will save my vision for this site for a later post, but today I will start down this new path with a brief rundown of the last forty-eight months.</p>
