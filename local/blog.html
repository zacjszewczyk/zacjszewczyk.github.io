<p>Tom Smith over at DZone, one of [a handful of websites</p>
<p>I read every day](My Morning Reads.txt), just finished a great three-part series on common cybersecurity shortfalls. He highlights the importance of basic countermeasures, like encryption and patching, all the way up to complex topics like attack vectors. I recommend all three: <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-part-1">part 1</a>, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-part-2">part 2</a>, and <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-other-part-3">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>I found Scott Murray&#8217;s post <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/dont-use-amazon-web-services.html">after I started looking for something to replace Amazon S3</a>. He lists a bunch of places for cheap or free static hosting, most of which I had never heard of.

<p>I have used GitHub <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">for a while now</a>, but even more over the last few weeks. Gists have proven especially useful, as a quick and easy way to take notes at work.

<p>Although a few weeks old now, I still think addressing this may have some enduring value.</p>

<p>Regulus Cyber got some attention a few weeks back for tricking a Tesla Model 3 into making a premature turn. Not an unsafe one, just premature. I almost didn&#8217;t read the post, though, let alone write about it, because <em>of course</em> you can trick a Tesla into turning early. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20235151">The</a> article&#8217;s <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/la10ax/tesla_model_3_spoofed_off_highway">popularity</a> made me come around, though, and so here we are. Evidently this is still 1) surprising, and 2) interesting, and I would like to address both of those here.  </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s tackle #1 first. This does not surprise me because at best, autonomous systems will drive as well as you do on an unfamiliar country road at night. Consider that scenario: you can see no more than a few feet ahead, know nothing about the road beyond your headlights, and have nothing but a questionable GPS route to guide you through the darkness. At any moment something could jump into your path, or you could find your way blocked by something no map will ever identify. These conditions are the human equivalent of the conditions under which the autonomous Tesla system operates at all times. Given that, <em>of course</em> Regulus Cyber tricked it into turning early.</p>

<p>Put yourself in that scenario. If you found yourself on an unfamiliar country road in the middle of the night, able to see maybe twenty feet ahead of you and navigating with a GPS that said to turn in a mile, would you turn early, onto another <em>road</em>, if that GPS told you to? I would. And that&#8217;s why this is neither surprising nor interesting to me, and why it should be neither to you as well. Of course you can trick a Tesla into turning early, because you could trick me into doing it, too. Instead of focusing on the weird edge cases where this miraculous technology fails(?) by doing the same thing a human would, how about we focus on all the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/5-times-elon-musk-and-teslas-autopilot-saved-their-drivers-bacon">lives</a> it saved <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/02/05/tesla-owner-autopilot-saves-life-swerving/">driving</a> <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/tesla-autopilot-saved-lives-of-family-says-driver">better</a> than we do?</p>

<p>On the topic of misunderstood technology, I have another point to make about the ridiculous notion of &#8220;planned obsolescence&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I will leave that for another day.</p>

<p>Steph Smith, on what it takes to become great. Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what greatness truly means. <em>I&#8217;ve come to learn that it&#8217;s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</em>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot agree more. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">As I said before about weightlifting</a>, &#8220;Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible. Before worrying about anything else, worry about doing that; that is the single most effective way to reach your goals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not try to explain away others&#8217; successes, or try to excuse your own failures, by calling them anything other than the results of long, hard work&#160;&#8212;&#160;or a lack thereof. Anything else would be a lie, to yourself and anyone else to which you justify your actions.</p>

<p>This post&#8217;s title comes from <a href="https://youtu.be/PurwB5H3F0o">Ray Lewis</a>. I love that line, and I encourage you to take it to heart. I did many years ago, and it has served me well.</p>

<p>Another gem I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tbt-writing-vs-writing.html">re-discoved</a> putting together my personal development initiative, Patrick McKenzie has some phenomenal advice for those just starting their careers. Out of all of his great work, if you read just one article, read this one. My favorite point: &#8220;You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with.&#8221; This hit me like a freight train the first time I read it, and I did well to remember it during college and my first year as an Officer. </p>

<p>I took over a team in June, and like Dwight, I have more than one priority. We have our mission and all the tasks it entails, but on my own time, I decided to also encourage my Solders to take an active role in their personal development. This involved a long write-up, a detailed plan, and a list of many books, articles, and projects to guide their study. Those will make their way here in time, but for now, I want to highlight some of the gems I re-discovered as part of this process&#160;&#8212;&#160;starting with <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/"><em>Writing vs writing</em></a>, by Shawn Blanc.  </p>

<p>I used to read everything <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a> wrote, and this piece from 2011 reminded me why. Writing is hard, and the people who don&#8217;t think so either haven&#8217;t written enough, or haven&#8217;t written well enough, to understand this.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html">a rundown of a cyber security threat hunting model</a> the other day.

It jumped out at me because he defined it well&#160;&#8212;&#160;which reminded me of all the times I have seen others fail at this&#160;&#8212;&#160;and prompted this post.</p>

<p>I like Antonio&#8217;s idea, a lot. As much as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I try to keep my system stock</a>, this will make transferring the scripts and aliases I have accumulated to new machines super easy. A few of my favorite aliases:</p>

<pre>
$ alias gs="git status"
$ alias gac="git add . &#38;&#38; git commit -m"
$ alias gp="git push"
</pre>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I have talked about these aliases before</a>; they make interacting with Git just a little bit easier. <a href="https://bitsofco.de/git-aliases-for-lazy-developers/">Hat-tip to Ire Aderinokun for the idea</a>.</p>

<pre>
alias gits="find ./ -name '.git' 2&gt; /dev/null | grep -v '.Trash'"
</pre>

<p>This neat snippet searches the current directory, and all sub directories, for Git repos. I have a lot of coding projects <a href="/projects.html">in the works</a>, and this helps me keep track of them.</p>

<pre>
alias r="source ~/.bash_profile"
</pre>

<p>This lets me refresh my bash profile whenever I make a change&#160;&#8212;&#160;for example, adding a new alias or script. Simple, and handy.</p>

<pre>
alias search="grep -rnw './' -e "
</pre>

<p>This alias gives me search functionality in the terminal, so I can avoid opening up Finder for most simple queries.</p>

<pre>
alias tree="find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g'"
</pre>

<p>This neat little command displays the current directory contents, and all its sub-directories, as a tree. I used this to create the tree in <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">the First Crack readme file</a>. <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/09/view-folder-tree-terminal-mac-os-tree-equivalent/">Hat-tip to OS X Daily for this one</a>.</p>

<p>I go back to work next week after a month-long vacation. I bought a house, traveled, read often, and wrote a little. Then I spent a lot of time thinking about those things. In particular, I spent a lot of time thinking about the choices that made me a homeowner at twenty-four, that also put me on a week-long beach vacation. I started writing again to help condense, clarify, and record trains of thought like these, so today I want to start with my thoughts on life and choices.</p>

<p>When I started blogging, I bounced around between places like Zoomshare, FreeWebs, and WordPres. Nothing fit, though, and so in 2011 I built my own content management system. I started running my website on <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> a few months later. Easy, fast, and portable, my engine has no dependencies, builds a static website of over one thousand pages in less than two seconds, and works just as well as a server daemon as it does on my home machine. I stopped posting public updates to the code base in 2015, but kept working on the project in private. Today I re-release First Crack to the world.</p>

<p>Patrick Wilbur has written a great two-part series on the dangers of public WiFi networks, over at HackerNoon. In <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-hacker-intercepted-your-wifi-traffic-stole-your-contacts-passwords-financial-data-heres-how-4fc0df9ff152">part one</a>, he shows just how little work it takes to steal personal information from unsuspecting users at a cafe. His <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-are-we-still-sending-so-much-web-traffic-unencrypted-over-the-internet-383317b758ec">second article</a> explains some of the reasons that took so little work, as well as a few ways to fix them. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-complete-endless-ridiculous-list-of-everything-you-need-to-be-safe-on-public-wi-fi-57fca0a733f7">Part three</a> outlines concrete steps the average internet user can take to make themselves less susceptible to these types of attacks. Whether you read all three to understand your vulnerability, or just skip to the end to fix them, everyone should take something away from this series. I also recommend <em><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/basic-computer-security.html">Basic Computer Security</a></em>, for the novice and expert alike.</p>

<p>The Internet ranks among the greatest inventions of all time. It gives everyone instant access to mankind&#8217;s collective wisdom, learned through millions of years of evolution. It connects people across cultures, continents, and time zones. It ushered in an era of unprecedented economic growth. History already recognizes the Internet&#8217;s remarkable impact, in the few short decades it has existed so far, and its significance will continue to grow as mankind uses it to achieve even greater things down the road.</p>

<p>Robert Graham just reminded me why <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">I started reading Errata Security</a>.

<p>I am immediately skeptical of any framework for getting something done. Individuals often use these elaborate processes to procrastinate, and in organizations they have a tendency to become bloated risk avoidance mechanisms. I see the former danger in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">David Maciver&#8217;s strategy for doing hard things</a>, but it did remind me of my own, so I want to take a minute to share my approach here.</p>

<p>In short, just do the hard thing. When you don&#8217;t feel like working out, <a href="https://youtu.be/N3t-em026ec">go</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/1023918579522002944">anyway</a>. When you don&#8217;t feel like writing, write anyway. The more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19958340">something scares you</a>, the more important it is that you get aggressive, charge into it, and crush that thing until it holds no power over you. You might need a twelve step process to conquer that hard thing, but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">just like in weightlifting</a>, give hard work a try first.</p>

<p>I have talked about arguments <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">for and against Huawei</a> before, as well as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk.html">the challenge of judging risk</a> in this space. Many of those in favor of Huawei cite a lack of concrete evidence against the company, but as James Vincent reports at <em>The Verge</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-china">it appears US intelligence agencies have begun providing that evidence</a>. The new law requiring them to cut ties with Huawei of course explains why US tech companies <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/05/google-intel-huawei.html">have done so</a>, but perhaps the fact that they did so without protest means the info <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-china">James references</a> is compelling after all.</p>

<p>I fancy myself a technical guy. I got into web development at a young age, learned to write Python, Perl, C, and a handful of other languages in high school, and got a degree in Computer Science in college. Although I work in an organization not known for its technical prowess, it has worked hard to change that: today, Army Cyber matches industry on the defensive side, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;by law&#160;&#8212;&#160;has far more experience on the offense. I bring all this <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">back up</a> so that you have some context when I say this: don&#8217;t use Amazon Web Services to host your static website; it&#8217;s far too complex. I spent twenty days struggling to work through that process. Today I will share my cautionary tale.</p>

<p>I try to keep my machine as close to stock as possible. This makes setup a breeze, helps it stay fast, and means I have less to check when something goes wrong. Although <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I have gotten away from that</a>, I have plans to re-work my setup soon. I appreciate posts like <a href="https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/10503/5-tasks-you-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-vim">this one</a>, from August Garcia at 256 Kilobytes, that remind me of these powerful built-in tools, and that I may not need a bunch of flashy third-party apps after all.</p>

<p>I follow a lot of websites. In <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html"><em>Keeping Up with Current Events</em></a>, I list the seventeen I use to start my day. These get regular updates and help me keep up on current events. I also follow a lot of websites run by independent writers and small shops. These cover many of the same topics, but due to their size, they do not get updated as often. The unique perspective they bring to the table, though, makes for some of the most interesting reading I do. To round out <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">my earlier post</a>, I want to share this list with you today.</p>

They focus on the chance of a hidden vulnerability in those devices, but ommit the fact that even top-tier Western devices have security flaws. This ommission implies that the decision comes down to accepting significant risk by adopting Huawei, in exchange for 5G, or accepting zero risk by shopping elsewhere. As this story demonstrates, though, Western tech may not have built-in vulnerabilities a non-Western nation-state actor could exploit, but it also does not guarantee network security. As this debate continues to rage, I believe we should keep this in mind.</p>
