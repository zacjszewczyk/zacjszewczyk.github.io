                    <time datetime="2019-08-09" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="blog/2019-08.html">08</a>/09 12:15:43 EST</time>
<p>Hillel Wayne explains why EMT&#8217;s continue to use error-prone paper Patient Care Reports even though they have digital replacements: the software is too slow.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;It wasn’t even <em>that</em> slow. Something like a quarter-second lag when you opened a dropdown or clicked a button. ... Did that quarter-second lag kill anyone? Was there someone who wouldn&#8217;t have died if the ePCR was just a little bit faster, fast enough to be usable? And the people who built it: did they ask the same questions? Did they say &#8216;premature optimization is bad&#8217; and not think about performance until it was too late? ... Most of us aren&#8217;t writing critical software. But this isn&#8217;t &#8216;critical software&#8217;, either: nobody will suddenly die if it breaks. You just switch back to paper PCRs. But it could have saved lives. At scale, it could have saved people dying from PCR errors.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This struck a chord with me. I once spent the first three hours of my day signing 10 PDFs on a horrendously underpowered thin client&#160;&#8212;&#160;and it shocked my co-workers when they heard I got through all of them before lunch. None of that work was critical, but the work I had to put off to get it done was. No one thought that through when they bought these machines, though: they saw small numbers in the &#8220;Total&#8221; and &#8220;Recurring&#8221; costs columns, and signed without question. Someone made a similar poor choice for digital Patient Care Reports, and although no one will ever take the time to know the true cost of either miscalculation, make no mistake&#160;&#8212;&#160;in both cases, it is high.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <time datetime="2019-08-08" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="blog/2019.html">2019</a>/<a href="blog/2019-08.html">08</a>/08 07:12:50 EST</time>
<p>I make a conscious effort to get out of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">my bubble</a> as much as possible, so when I saw a Jalopnik article proclaiming <a href="https://jalopnik.com/vanlife-can-be-cheaper-weirder-and-more-accessible-th-1836822787">Vanlife Can Be Cheaper, Weirder, And More Accessible Than Instagram Would Have You Believe</a>, I bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll give Anna Merlan the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she started with the idea that vanlife could be cheaper, weirder, and more accessible than Instagram might lead you to believe, then set out to prove that by living in a 19-year-old Chrysler Town and Country while she travelled from Los Angeles to New Mexico. She spent a lot of time complaining about heat in the desert in the summer, the inconvenience of not having a shower or toilet in a van she did not add a shower or toilet to, and mediocre meals from mediocre food, though, interspersed with complaints about the vanlife community&#8217;s homogeneity. For the most part, it read as a hit piece. I agree and support her point that this lifestyle does not require an expensive luxury van or expensive accessories, but if she actually set out to show that, her general lack of preparedness set herself up for failure and made sure that she did a poor job of it.</p>

<p>So what should she have done? Without spending a dime, she could have dealt with the heat by staying out of the desert in the middle of summer, lined an old bucket with a trash bag for a makeshift toilet and used an elevated water container for a makeshift shower, and invested some time <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/camp-kitchen-tips.html">planning</a> <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2201216/how-make-kickass-camp-meal">for</a> <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2262421/guide-ultimate-backcountry-thanksgiving">tasty, easy camp meals</a>. Basic camping tricks. She could have had some better, long-term solutions for the price of a few dollars, but her point was that this lifestyle does not require expensive things; she could have actually made it for the price of a bit of effort.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t read Jack Donovan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis">work</a> or <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/podcast-2/">listened</a> to <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-243-becoming-barbarian/">his</a> <a href="https://www.orderofman.com/a-more-complete-beast-jack-donovan/">podcasts</a> in a while, so I forgot how good some of his stuff is until I re-discovered <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2011/03/violence-is-golden/"><em>Violence is Golden</em></a> this morning. From his article:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;A rule not ultimately backed by the threat of violence is merely a suggestion. States rely on laws enforced by men ready to do violence against lawbreakers. Every tax, every code and every licensing requirement demands an escalating progression of penalties that, in the end, must result in the forcible seizure of property or imprisonment by armed men prepared to do violence in the event of resistance or non–compliance. ... Without action, words are just words. Without violence, laws are just words. Violence isn’t the only answer, but it is the final answer.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ours is a comfortable reality&#160;&#8212;&#160;but just barely.</p>

<p>Another great piece from a few years ago, this time by Brendan Leonard at Outside Online in 2017: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;You want a shortcut, here&#8217;s one: Stop believing that anyone who&#8217;s successful at anything has some secret other than focus, drive, and a shitload of hard work. There&#8217;s your shortcut.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this. Every few weeks, someone stops me in the gym to ask for a shortcut. &#8220;Man, that&#8217;s an insane deadlift. How did you get it that high?&#8221; Others say things that make me want to smack them: &#8220;I could never do that.&#8221; The truth is, you could if you wanted to&#160;&#8212;&#160;and as for how I got it that high, the un-sexy answer is months of long, hard, back-breaking, and grueling work after 5 A.M. wake-ups and ten hour work days. I got here because I put in the work and the effort to achieve my goals&#160;&#8212;&#160;not because I discovered some shortcut that <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/all-that-time.html">you</a> didn&#8217;t. </p>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">As I said about weightlifting</a>, &#8220;Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Get out there and do the work. Stop looking for a shortcut.</p>

<p>Wes Siler has some advice for those looking to buy an adventure vehicle. I agree with almost everything he says, even if most of it just applies to those who already have one: get good tires, have a tire repair kit and recovery gear, get advanced driver training, pack less, don&#8217;t try to force an inadequate car into the role of a much more capable one, and understand the difference between AWD and 4WD&#160;&#8212;&#160;but the rest, not so much. He also suggests leasing instead of buying (say goodbye to things like bumpers and roof racks, and don&#8217;t get too adventurous), defaulting to a truck (too large and heavy unless you choose a mid-size pickup, at which point you might as well get an SUV like a 4Runner), and avoiding a Tacoma&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of the most capable off-road trucks in North America&#160;&#8212;&#160;at all costs. Take the good from this piece and ignore the bad. I plan to post a guide of my own soon.</p>

<p>I threw together a web scraper the other day for a project at work. Since web scraping is easy, I had extra time, and I needed to poll a few hundred pages from a single domain often, I rotate through a pool of user agent strings and randomize my request pattern to make it less likely that the server will block me. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a> once blocked me after <a href="/projects.html#hnScraper">I did not take precautions like these</a>, so I made sure to avoid that this time around. Pierre over at ScrapingNinja <a href="https://www.scrapingninja.co/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">talked about these and a few other strategies yesterday</a>. Looks like I have a few features to add.</p>

<p>Joe Jackson has some good tips for better camp kitchens. I like to keep everything for cooking, eating, and cleaning in one container, packed at all times. I keep a second one empty for dry goods. This makes trip prep a breeze: I just load the first tote in my car, then fill up the second tote and my cooler in the grocery store&#8217;s parking lot on my way out of town. Along with <a href="http://www.alpsmountaineering.com/products/furniture/tables/regular-dining-table">two dining tables</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Aqua-Tainer-Gallon-Container/dp/B001QC31G6">two water jugs</a>, and <a href="/projects.html#sleepingPlatform">my storage system</a>, this setup makes cooking tough meals easy, and eating them fun.</p>

<p>I work in a technical profession, writing code and inspecting network traffic all day&#160;&#8212;&#160;and I found Anuschka Rees&#8217; two-part series on garment quality fascinating. She approaches this topic as a technical one, with the exacting attention to detail I have come to appreciate in my line of work. I have devoted a lot of time to learning subtleties like these as a way to choose better adventure clothing, and could have seen myself writing something like this someday. Now I may never have to.

<p>A little over a year ago, I moved to Fort Gordon for the Cyber Basic Officer Leaders Course. I saw one of my former classmates in the gym this morning, lounging on a bench press near two of his Soldiers. He once said that he did not have hours to spend in the gym every day, and that he had better things to do with his time.</p>

<p>Tom Smith over at DZone, one of <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">a handful of websites I read every day</a>, just finished a great three-part series on common cybersecurity shortfalls. He highlights the importance of basic countermeasures, like encryption and patching, all the way up to complex topics like attack vectors. I recommend all three: <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-part-1">part 1</a>, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-part-2">part 2</a>, and <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/most-common-security-fails-other-part-3">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>I have used GitHub <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">for a while now</a>, but even more over the last few weeks. Gists have proven especially useful, as a quick and easy way to take notes at work.

<p>Although a few weeks old now, I still think addressing this may have some enduring value.</p>

<p>Regulus Cyber got some attention a few weeks back for tricking a Tesla Model 3 into making a premature turn. Not an unsafe one, just premature. I almost didn&#8217;t read the post, though, let alone write about it, because <em>of course</em> you can trick a Tesla into turning early. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20235151">The</a> article&#8217;s <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/la10ax/tesla_model_3_spoofed_off_highway">popularity</a> made me come around, though, and so here we are. Evidently this is still 1) surprising, and 2) interesting, and I would like to address both of those here.  </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s tackle #1 first. This does not surprise me because at best, autonomous systems will drive as well as you do on an unfamiliar country road at night. Consider that scenario: you can see no more than a few feet ahead, know nothing about the road beyond your headlights, and have nothing but a questionable GPS route to guide you through the darkness. At any moment something could jump into your path, or you could find your way blocked by something no map will ever identify. These conditions are the human equivalent of the conditions under which the autonomous Tesla system operates at all times. Given that, <em>of course</em> Regulus Cyber tricked it into turning early.</p>

<p>Put yourself in that scenario. If you found yourself on an unfamiliar country road in the middle of the night, able to see maybe twenty feet ahead of you and navigating with a GPS that said to turn in a mile, would you turn early, onto another <em>road</em>, if that GPS told you to? I would. And that&#8217;s why this is neither surprising nor interesting to me, and why it should be neither to you as well. Of course you can trick a Tesla into turning early, because you could trick me into doing it, too. Instead of focusing on the weird edge cases where this miraculous technology fails(?) by doing the same thing a human would, how about we focus on all the <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/5-times-elon-musk-and-teslas-autopilot-saved-their-drivers-bacon">lives</a> it saved <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/02/05/tesla-owner-autopilot-saves-life-swerving/">driving</a> <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/tesla-autopilot-saved-lives-of-family-says-driver">better</a> than we do?</p>

<p>On the topic of misunderstood technology, I have another point to make about the ridiculous notion of &#8220;planned obsolescence&#8221;&#160;&#8212;&#160;but I will leave that for another day.</p>

<p>Steph Smith, on what it takes to become great. Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what greatness truly means. <em>I&#8217;ve come to learn that it&#8217;s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</em>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot agree more. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">As I said before about weightlifting</a>, &#8220;Effort, and nothing else, decides success. More than diet, macronutrients, workout gear, or even your training routine, the most impactful thing you can do is workout every single day, as hard as possible, for as long as possible. Before worrying about anything else, worry about doing that; that is the single most effective way to reach your goals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not try to explain away others&#8217; successes, or try to excuse your own failures, by calling them anything other than the results of long, hard work&#160;&#8212;&#160;or a lack thereof. Anything else would be a lie, to yourself and anyone else to which you justify your actions.</p>

<p>This post&#8217;s title comes from <a href="https://youtu.be/PurwB5H3F0o">Ray Lewis</a>. I love that line, and I encourage you to take it to heart. I did many years ago, and it has served me well.</p>

<p>Another gem I <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/tbt-writing-vs-writing.html">re-discoved</a> putting together my personal development initiative, Patrick McKenzie has some phenomenal advice for those just starting their careers. Out of all of his great work, if you read just one article, read this one. My favorite point: &#8220;You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with.&#8221; This hit me like a freight train the first time I read it, and I did well to remember it during college and my first year as an Officer. </p>

<p>I took over a team in June, and like Dwight, I have more than one priority. We have our mission and all the tasks it entails, but on my own time, I decided to also encourage my Solders to take an active role in their personal development. This involved a long write-up, a detailed plan, and a list of many books, articles, and projects to guide their study. Those will make their way here in time, but for now, I want to highlight some of the gems I re-discovered as part of this process&#160;&#8212;&#160;starting with <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2011/02/writing-vs-writing/"><em>Writing vs writing</em></a>, by Shawn Blanc.  </p>

<p>I used to read everything <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a> wrote, and this piece from 2011 reminded me why. Writing is hard, and the people who don&#8217;t think so either haven&#8217;t written enough, or haven&#8217;t written well enough, to understand this.</p>
