<p>I read <a href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html">a rundown of a cyber security threat hunting model</a> the other day. Right at the start, the author&#8217;s definition of &#8220;hunting&#8221; jumped out at me. It jumped out at me because he defined it well&#160;&#8212;&#160;which reminded me of all the times I have seen others fail at this&#160;&#8212;&#160;and prompted this post.</p>

<p>I like Antonio&#8217;s idea, a lot. As much as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I try to keep my system stock</a>, this will make transferring the scripts and aliases I have accumulated to new machines super easy. A few of my favorite aliases:</p>

<pre>
$ alias gs="git status"
$ alias gac="git add . &#38;&#38; git commit -m"
$ alias gp="git push"
</pre>

<p><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I have talked about these aliases before</a>; they make interacting with Git just a little bit easier. <a href="https://bitsofco.de/git-aliases-for-lazy-developers/">Hat-tip to Ire Aderinokun for the idea</a>.</p>

<pre>
alias gits="find ./ -name '.git' 2&gt; /dev/null | grep -v '.Trash'"
</pre>

<p>This neat snippet searches the current directory, and all sub directories, for Git repos. I have a lot of coding projects <a href="/projects.html">in the works</a>, and this helps me keep track of them.</p>

<pre>
alias r="source ~/.bash_profile"
</pre>

<p>This lets me refresh my bash profile whenever I make a change&#160;&#8212;&#160;for example, adding a new alias or script. Simple, and handy.</p>

<pre>
alias search="grep -rnw './' -e "
</pre>

<p>This alias gives me search functionality in the terminal, so I can avoid opening up Finder for most simple queries.</p>

<pre>
alias tree="find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g'"
</pre>

<p>This neat little command displays the current directory contents, and all its sub-directories, as a tree. I used this to create the tree in <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">the First Crack readme file</a>. <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/09/view-folder-tree-terminal-mac-os-tree-equivalent/">Hat-tip to OS X Daily for this one</a>.</p>

<p>I go back to work next week after a month-long vacation. I bought a house, traveled, read often, and wrote a little. Then I spent a lot of time thinking about those things. In particular, I spent a lot of time thinking about the choices that made me a homeowner at twenty-four, that also put me on a week-long beach vacation. I started writing again to help condense, clarify, and record trains of thought like these, so today I want to start with my thoughts on life and choices.</p>

<p>When I started blogging, I bounced around between places like Zoomshare, FreeWebs, and WordPres. Nothing fit, though, and so in 2011 I built my own content management system. I started running my website on <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a> a few months later. Easy, fast, and portable, my engine has no dependencies, builds a static website of over one thousand pages in less than two seconds, and works just as well as a server daemon as it does on my home machine. I stopped posting public updates to the code base in 2015, but kept working on the project in private. Today I re-release First Crack to the world.</p>

<p>Patrick Wilbur has written a great two-part series on the dangers of public WiFi networks, over at HackerNoon. In <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-hacker-intercepted-your-wifi-traffic-stole-your-contacts-passwords-financial-data-heres-how-4fc0df9ff152">part one</a>, he shows just how little work it takes to steal personal information from unsuspecting users at a cafe. His <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-are-we-still-sending-so-much-web-traffic-unencrypted-over-the-internet-383317b758ec">second article</a> explains some of the reasons that took so little work, as well as a few ways to fix them. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-complete-endless-ridiculous-list-of-everything-you-need-to-be-safe-on-public-wi-fi-57fca0a733f7">Part three</a> outlines concrete steps the average internet user can take to make themselves less susceptible to these types of attacks. Whether you read all three to understand your vulnerability, or just skip to the end to fix them, everyone should take something away from this series. I also recommend <em><a href="https://zacs.site/blog/basic-computer-security.html">Basic Computer Security</a></em>, for the novice and expert alike.</p>

<p>The Internet ranks among the greatest inventions of all time. It gives everyone instant access to mankind&#8217;s collective wisdom, learned through millions of years of evolution. It connects people across cultures, continents, and time zones. It ushered in an era of unprecedented economic growth. History already recognizes the Internet&#8217;s remarkable impact, in the few short decades it has existed so far, and its significance will continue to grow as mankind uses it to achieve even greater things down the road.</p>

<p>I am immediately skeptical of any framework for getting something done. Individuals often use these elaborate processes to procrastinate, and in organizations they have a tendency to become bloated risk avoidance mechanisms. I see the former danger in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">David Maciver&#8217;s strategy for doing hard things</a>, but it did remind me of my own, so I want to take a minute to share my approach here.</p>

<p>In short, just do the hard thing. When you don&#8217;t feel like working out, <a href="https://youtu.be/N3t-em026ec">go</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/1023918579522002944">anyway</a>. When you don&#8217;t feel like writing, write anyway. The more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19958340">something scares you</a>, the more important it is that you get aggressive, charge into it, and crush that thing until it holds no power over you. You might need a twelve step process to conquer that hard thing, but <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">just like in weightlifting</a>, give hard work a try first.</p>

<p>I have talked about arguments <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/proxy-innovation.html">for and against Huawei</a> before, as well as <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk.html">the challenge of judging risk</a> in this space. Many of those in favor of Huawei cite a lack of concrete evidence against the company, but as James Vincent reports at <em>The Verge</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-china">it appears US intelligence agencies have begun providing that evidence</a>. The new law requiring them to cut ties with Huawei of course explains why US tech companies <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/05/google-intel-huawei.html">have done so</a>, but perhaps the fact that they did so without protest means the info <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632236/us-spy-chiefs-brief-silicon-valley-tech-execs-danger-business-china">James references</a> is compelling after all.</p>

<p>I fancy myself a technical guy. I got into web development at a young age, learned to write Python, Perl, C, and a handful of other languages in high school, and got a degree in Computer Science in college. Although I work in an organization not known for its technical prowess, it has worked hard to change that: today, Army Cyber matches industry on the defensive side, and&#160;&#8212;&#160;by law&#160;&#8212;&#160;has far more experience on the offense. I bring all this <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/the-last-four-years.html">back up</a> so that you have some context when I say this: don&#8217;t use Amazon Web Services to host your static website; it&#8217;s far too complex. I spent twenty days struggling to work through that process. Today I will share my cautionary tale.</p>

<p>I try to keep my machine as close to stock as possible. This makes setup a breeze, helps it stay fast, and means I have less to check when something goes wrong. Although <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-setup-2019.html">I have gotten away from that</a>, I have plans to re-work my setup soon. I appreciate posts like <a href="https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/10503/5-tasks-you-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-vim">this one</a>, from August Garcia at 256 Kilobytes, that remind me of these powerful built-in tools, and that I may not need a bunch of flashy third-party apps after all.</p>

<p>I follow a lot of websites. In <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html"><em>Keeping Up with Current Events</em></a>, I list the seventeen I use to start my day. These get regular updates and help me keep up on current events. I also follow a lot of websites run by independent writers and small shops. These cover many of the same topics, but due to their size, they do not get updated as often. The unique perspective they bring to the table, though, makes for some of the most interesting reading I do. To round out <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-morning-reads.html">my earlier post</a>, I want to share this list with you today.</p>

This ommission implies that the decision comes down to accepting significant risk by adopting Huawei, in exchange for 5G, or accepting zero risk by shopping elsewhere. As this story demonstrates, though, Western tech may not have built-in vulnerabilities a non-Western nation-state actor could exploit, but it also does not guarantee network security. As this debate continues to rage, I believe we should keep this in mind.</p>

<p>I have always admired the well-informed. Their ability to speak on complex topics, to make thought-provoking points about things of which I know little, impresses me. This happened again a few months ago, with a retired Army Colonel whose knowledge of the American Revolution, the geopolitical landscape, and war floored me. I absorbed all I could from him. He also made me realize that I needed to do a much better job of educating myself and keeping up with current events. I have worked hard to do that over the last three months. Today I want to talk about my strategy for keeping up with world affairs. The self-education side of this coin warrants its own article, so I will save that for later.</p>

<p>Nicholas Diakopoulos, at the Columbia Journalism Review, wrote a fascinating piece on Google&#8217;s growing influence over the news and its bias for left-leaning sources:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;The data shows that just 20 news sources account for more than half of article impressions. The top 20 percent of sources (136 of 678) accounted for 86 percent of article impressions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, later:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Our data shows that 62.4 percent of article impressions were from sources rated by that research as left-leaning, whereas 11.3 percent were from sources rated as right-leaning. ... A higher proportion of left-leaning sources appear in Top Stories.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The level to which Google decides the type of stories users see, and the algorithm&#8217;s evident bias in that decision, ought to chill even those who benefit from it.</p>

<p>In an article I will post soon, I mention the difference between smart and intelligent people. I have seen this explained in more ways than I can count, but none the way I define it. Rather than burying this in an already long piece, I want to talk about it here so that I can flesh it out and then cite it later.</p>

<p>Over the years I have dialed in my writing process. I started typing posts in a textbox on Zoomshare; nowadays, I write in a powerful text editor, track changes with version control software, keep redundant backups, and serve this site with a back-end I wrote myself. I have set myself up well with a pretty neat workflow, and today I want to share it with you.</p>

<p>I had a hard time getting Sublime Text to work with <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked 2</a>, back when I used Brett&#8217;s app to proof my writing. Dan Sturm posted <a href="https://doingthatwrong.com/home/2012/5/21/launching-marked-from-sublime-text-2.html">a simple snippet</a> that launched it using a build system, that failed if Marked came from the App Store.

<p>A few days ago, I decided to start an article about my writing setup. Over the years I have dialed it in, and today I have a pretty neat workflow. As I started on that piece, though, I realized that I had never talked about why I write in plain text. Most aspects of my workflow traces back to that choice, so today I want to explain some of the reasons I made it.</p>

<p>Dominik Vacikar measured growth signals for 4,000 companies, then searched for historical correlations between those signals and stock market performance. His research lead to some interesting results that he plans to turn into an interest product. This reminded me of <a href="/projects.html#hnScraper">my work on a Hacker News scraper</a>, a project I hope to revive soon.</p>

<p>I talked about <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/my-road-to-weightlifting.html">my road to weightlifting</a> the other day, to give you insight into my background. Having reached each end of the fitness spectrum, and after going back and forth between extreme conditioning and extreme strength, I look forward to sharing with you the lessons I learned along the way. As I work to regain the strength I lost over the last month, I want to highlight some of the consequences of that decision. In doing so, I hope to better prepare you for this difficult journey, and help you avoid some common pitfalls.</p>

<p>I found this article after <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/2016/07/22/making-obvious-fast.html"><em>Making the obvious code fast</em></a>, where Jack Mott explained the impact of ignoring basic optimization. In his 2016 piece <a href="https://jackmott.github.io/programming/tools/editor/ide/visual/studio/2016/07/01/marginal-gains.html"><em>Marginal Gains</em></a>, he went over some small tips to make developers&#8217; lives easier. He had some good suggestions, and I want to take a minute to emphasize one of his points.</p>

<p><strong>Use the command line as much as possible, so that you can automate as much of your work as possible.</strong> Most programs wrap one or more command line tools. This helps non-technical people. Take out the middleman, though, learn to use the underlying tool, and then write a script to work for you. Automate the boring tasks, so that you can focus on the exciting ones, take on new roles, further your own education, or even start a side hustle.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time optimizing images for the web, for example, <a href="https://imageoptim.com/command-line.html">let the command line handle that</a>. Do you work with videos? <a href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.2.0/cli/command-line-reference.html">It can handle that, too</a>. If you spend hours scrolling through thousands of lines of log files, <a href="http://droptips.com/using-grep-to-exclude-lines-containing-certain-characterstext">why not save some time by taking out all traffic to the server from your developers&#8217; machines?</a> You cannot do everything with the command line, but you can free yourself from the boring in favor of more challenging and interesting work.</p>

<p>This piece, by August Garcia over at the horrendously designed <a href="https://www.256kilobytes.com/">256 Kilobytes</a>, is a good counterpoint to <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/odlyzko/doc/cyberinsecurity.pdf">a paper I didn&#8217;t bother linking</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19442049">when it hit Hacker News</a> last month.
