                    <time datetime="2013-05-01" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="blog/2013.html">2013</a>/<a href="blog/2013-05.html">05</a>/01 10:40:56 EST</time>
<p>In the past I have written one article about women and equality, <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/a-crying-shame.html"><em>A Crying Shame</em></a>. I am quite proud of that article. So much so, in fact, that unlike many of the other topics I rehash here, I have felt no need to write anything more on the subject. I did feel pushed to at least mention the article linked at the head of this post, however, especially after listening to what I seem to recall was episode #114 of Back to Work a few weeks ago. In <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/114">I&#8217;m Moving to FudgePacker</a>, Merlin Mann talked about misconstrued statistics and how improper representations of inaccurate statistics can lead to incorrect conclusions on important issues when in actuality, maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;just maybe&#160;&#8212;&#160;it isn&#8217;t quite as bad as everyone likes to stand up and claim it to be.</p>

<p>Merlin&#8217;s example chronicled a previous discussion with a woman advocating equality in the tech sector. She argued citing a statistic claiming that women receive, on average, a significantly smaller salary than their male counterparts. In response, Merlin asked whether she or any of her female co-workers experienced this disproportionality; she responded that none had. He also pointed out that in citing an average, by definition an equal number of people receiving a salary greater than the average must also receive a salary smaller than the average, and that the difference in those amounts must be the same. In other words, if on average women are paid 75<code> of the wages given to their male co-workers, for example, and within this sample group of women they are all paid 100</code> of the wages given to their male counterparts, it follows that in order for the statistic to be accurate, some women, somewhere, must be receiving 25<code> less than the average, or 50</code> of the wages allocated to their male counterparts. And really&#160;&#8212;&#160;and this was his ultimate point&#160;&#8212;&#160;is this actually happening anywhere?</p>

<p>But back to Rae Hoffman&#8217;s article, the piece that got me started down this rabbit trail:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Of course, some people look at the lineup and immediately assume highly talented women are being &#8216;excluded&#8217;. Of course, they don&#8217;t know that for a fact. For all they know, 95<code> of speaker pitches came from men and thus why they ended up with a 95</code> male speaker line up once they whittled down the list to the best pitches.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the release of Tweetbot 3 Tapbots brought a complete user interface overhaul to the beloved Twitter app alongside a whole slew of other improvements and changes. One such change saw the removal of both Tweetbot&#8217;s double- and triple-tap functionality. Citing increased responsiveness as the app would no longer have to wait for iOS to discern whether the user intended multiple taps, Tapbots replaced this feature with a curious swipe gesture. Believing it would work similarly to Mailbox&#8217;s finicky yet workable gestures where swiping different distances invoked different actions, I looked forward to this improvement; however, in this regard Tweetbot 3 fell far short of excellence.</p>

<p>Shawn Blanc posted by far and away the best iPad and iPad Mini first look I have read thus far. I enjoyed <a href="https://twitter.com/theloop/statuses/400281801924427776">the flame war</a> over Jim&#8217;s article immensely, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/11/13/significantly-hotter">Marco&#8217;s own &#8220;review&#8221;</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;if it even merits such a designation&#160;&#8212;&#160;had its own humorous high point, but up till now nothing impressed me to the extent that Shawn&#8217;s piece did.</p>
