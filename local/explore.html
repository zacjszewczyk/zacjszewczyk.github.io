<p>In a style made popular by Benedict Evans in his hallmark Twitter postulations, posit: computers were created for writers. As such, the next iteration of computing devices will cater to the needs of others: creators and designers will have Jarvis-like artificial intelligence systems to converse with and holographic interfaces to involve their entire bodies in the creation process. The current model involves the two tools of the writer&#8217;s trade: their hands and their minds. Future implementations will go beyond those unnecessary restrictions that don&#8217;t apply in other fields in order to provide a richer, more productive computing experience.</p>

<p>Jeff Huang, echoing a point I made in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html"><em>Own Your Platform</em></a>, in his piece on the importance of building websites that stand the test of time:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve recommended my students to push websites to Heroku, and publish portfolios on Wix. Yet every platform with irreplaceable content dies off some day. Geocities, LiveJournal, what.cd, now Yahoo Groups. One day, Medium, Twitter, and even hosting services like GitHub Pages will be plundered then discarded when they can no longer grow or cannot find a working business model.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, later, he echoes a point I made in <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/how-to-own-your-platform.html"><em>How to Own Your Platform</em></a>, about the vulnerable position relying on trendy third-party frameworks puts you in: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;... a growing set of libraries and frameworks are making the web more sophisticated but also more complex. First came jquery, then bootstrap, npm, angular, grunt, webpack, and more. If you are a web developer who is keeping up with the latest, then that&#8217;s not a problem. But if not, maybe you are an embedded systems programmer or startup CTO or enterprise Java developer or chemistry PhD student, sure you could probably figure out how to set up some web server and toolchain, but will you keep this up year after year, decade after decade? Probably not, and when the next year when you encounter a package dependency problem or figure out how to regenerate your html files, you might just throw your hands up and zip up the files to deal with &#8216;later&#8217;. Even simple technology stacks like static site generators (e.g., Jekyll) require a workflow and will stop working at some point. You fall into npm dependency hell, and forget the command to package a release.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run your website, and <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">own the production stack</a>. Jeff has some some good ideas, but do not paper over poor back-end design with good front-end work. <a href="https://zacs.site/blog/own-your-platform.html">Own your platform</a>, so that you can ensure both will stand the test of time.</p>

<time datetime="2020-01-07" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac J. Szewczyk</link> on <a href="blog/2020.html">2020</a>/<a href="blog/2020-01.html">01</a>/07 07:04:48 EST</time>
<p>Nikita Prokopov, on the growing complexity of software and the shrinking number of people who understand it:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what&#8217;s going on down the stack. ... Docker and Electron are the most hyped new technologies of the last five years. Both are not about improving things, figuring out complexity or reducing it. Both are just compromised attempts to hide accumulated complexity from developers because it became impossible to deal with.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw this in college, when even Computer Science students favored complex and bloated frameworks over their own code. I make a concerted effort to counter it in my own projects: <a href="/projects.html#firstCrack">First Crack</a>, the custom blog engine behind this site, uses vanilla Python 2 or 3 and has no dependencies. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">If you</a> decide <a href="https://johnkurkowski.com/posts/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-program-but-come-back-in-10-years/">to code</a>, <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/no-such-thing-as-knowing-coding-all-the-way-to-the-bottom/">you don&#8217;t have to start with C</a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;but you should learn it. I resisted this during college, but two years into my career, I have come around: the lower you go, the better you will understand things higher in the stack. With greater understanding comes an increased ability to influence those things, which, in turn, will make you better at your job.</p>

<p>Michal Charemza brought up another good point in <a href="https://charemza.name/blog/posts/abstractions/http/http-guide-for-developers/"><em>Mini HTTP guide for developers</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;Frameworks often hide/abstract parts of HTTP away. I think this is often a bit of a shame: it hides what&#8217;s possible with HTTP, and so can lead to effects on engineering decisions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By learning to use frameworks instead of the tools and protocols they implement, developers not only miss out on foundational knowledge that will help them become better at their job, but also hamstring themselves to the subset of features the frameworks’ creators’ felt important enough to enable. Expanding a project beyond that expected use case will require diving into those low-level tools and protocol—-which, again, you do not have to start with, but you should learn at some point.</p>
