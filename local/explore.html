<a href="https://zenhabits.net/honest-mindfulness/" class="linkpost">The Honest Guide to Meditation</a>
                    </h2>
<time datetime="2020-02-14" pubdate="pubdate">By <link rel="author">Zac Szewczyk</link> on <a href="blog/2020.html">2020</a>/<a href="blog/2020-02.html">02</a>/14 09:13:50 EST</time>
<p>I like most of Leo Babauta&#8217;s work, but this one disappointed me. He titled it <a href="https://zenhabits.net/honest-mindfulness/"><em>The Honest Guide to Mindfulness</em></a>, but a more apt title would have been <em>The Honest Guide to Meditation</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;because he talked about nothing else. Meditation, though, is a practice some have used to become more mindful, not the goal itself, and by no means the epitome of mindfulness. </p>

<p>My favorite explanation of mindfulness came from an episode of <a href="https://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a>, in which Merlin Mann described it as the ability to watch cars go by without feeling the need to jump in. The patent absurdity of this analogy made the value of mindfulness value clear, when he explained that the cars symbolized our emotions: temporary, quick to change, and far too often dictated by people and situations over which we have no control. The goal of mindfulness&#160;&#8212;&#160;which, again, some have found <em>through</em> meditation&#160;&#8212;&#160;is not to do the impossible, to wrestle back from a chaotic world command over those cars, but rather to regain control of the one actor in that scenario you have any hope of influencing: yourself. </p>

<p>You will never control which cars come, when they go by, or who drives them, but you can&#160;&#8212;&#160;with practice&#160;&#8212;&#160;learn to control their ability to hijack your life. An honest guide to that, real mindfulness, may have done some good.</p>

<p>Thanks to the magic that is Instapaper, I was able to reference the original text of Josh Topolsky&#8217;s article <a href="http://joshuatopolsky.com/post/31285353423/integrity-and-bullies-with-blogs"><em>Integrity and Bullies with Blogs</em></a> rather than the updated version available on his Tumblr blog, although my efforts proved to be for naught when I found the only difference between the two version to be the removal of a single sentence in the opening paragraph. Despite this I do not regret spending the extra ten minutes it took to locate a device equipped with Instapaper that had not synced with the Instapaper servers since I moved the article to the Archive folder&#160;&#8212;&#160;an action that removes the local cache in favor of a link to the article&#8217;s source&#160;&#8212;&#160;and install a Sublime Text plugin to diff the two copies of Josh&#8217;s article. I don&#8217;t regret what turned out to be an unnecessary expenditure of a minimal amount of time and effort for two reasons, the first of which is that in doing so I obtained the tools necessary to perform this task for future articles where it might be of greater importance. More importantly though, because taking an extra few minutes to verify the validity of my premise and formulate my thoughts into cohesive points is a step I believe every writer and especially those involved in this debacle could learn from.</p>

<p>Originally published under the title &#8220;Future Mac Fans Will Be Smaller And Quieter Than Ever [Patent]&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t help but link to this blatant attack from Luke Dormehl. Who is he to predict the vocality or physical dimensions of Mac fans in the future? We are a community made of diverse individuals both outspoken and introverted; small and large. To so insensitively equate each and every one of us, then, making such a broad generalization as to our future is not only a claim completely unsubstantiable, but remarkably offensive as well. Getting just a little cocky over there at Cult of Mac, aren&#8217;t we?</p>
