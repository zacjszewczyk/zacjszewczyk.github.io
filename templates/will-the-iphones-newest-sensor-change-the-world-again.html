    <p>In an excellent article posted to The Verge earlier this afternoon Casey Newton made the point I intended to discuss this evening almost as an aside near the end of his article:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Apple could also let users log in to other apps and services using a fingerprints, providing secure authentication into apps and websites with a couple of taps. If biometric solutions become widely adopted, the tech industry could begin to phase out&#160;&#8212;&#160;or at least augment&#160;&#8212;&#160;the flawed, familiar password.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>With the advent of Passbook in iOS 6, Apple began handling important personal information such as credit card numbers, boarding passes, and gift cards. A few months ago in June, when  the company announced iCloud Keychain, it expanded that domain to include passwords, but only on the Mac platform. Before too long&#160;&#8212;&#160;hopefully prior to iOS 8&#160;&#8212;&#160;I foresee Apple marrying these two technologies with Touch ID on iOS to give users the ability to not only unlock their phone with a fingerprint, but login to websites and apps with that same technology.</p>
    
    <p>Touch ID in its current form is a technology in its infancy; it will take time before we see the full potential of the groundbreaking feature, and perhaps even longer before we realize it.</p>
