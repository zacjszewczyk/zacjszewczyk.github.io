    <p>I was first introduced to The Next Web during the plagiarism fiasco from a few months back, which I wrote about in my post from quite a while ago titled <a href="/blog/bullies"><em>Credibility and Bullies with Blogs</em></a>. In that article, I briefly conveyed the lasting impression the whole affair left on my mind regarding The Next Web: &#8220;I have associated The Next Web with plagiarism, rash outbursts, and poor choices.&#8221; As I said in that article, to this day I refuse to read articles on The Next Web.</p>
    
    <p>My first real introduction to The Verge happened a few weeks later, when Josh Topolsky responded to accusations from John Gruber and Marco Arment that The Verge&#8217;s staff was pulling their punches when reviewing products designed nearly identically to that of Apple&#8217;s equivalents. I use &#8220;equivalents&#8221; very loosely here. I had certainly heard of The Verge before then, but that event served as my formal introduction to the site, and also established a general dislike of Josh Topolsky.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike in the case of Josh Topolsky and The Verge, I did not overcome my first impression of The Next Web: to this day I refuse to read any articles posted to the site. Maybe I&#8217;m the one losing here. Maybe I would benefit from reading the articles posted on The Next Web. But we have to draw the line somewhere, and this is where I choose to draw mine.</p>
