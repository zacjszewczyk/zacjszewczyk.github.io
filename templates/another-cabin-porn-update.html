    <p>Rather than posting separate articles for each cool cabin I came across or interesting story I found on <a href="http://freecabinporn.com">Cabin Porn</a> throughout this past day, I decided to condense the day&#8217;s updates into a single post. There are a few cabins, however, whose stories merited more than a simple line item on an imposingly long list, and for those I did make an exception.</p>
    
    <ulstart='1'>
<li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/25183549412/from-peter-anderson-so-i-bought-a-140-acre-gold">140 Acre Gold Mining Claim</a>. Certainly not the nicest of cabins, and I don&#8217;t know much about real estate, but I&#8217;d say Peter Anderson made off with a steal at just $3,000 for this massive plot and the accompanying cabins. What a catch.</li>
    <li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/24130198168/cabin-between-austria-and-slovenia-submitted-and">Cabin between Austria and Slovenia</a>. This view reminded me of a hike I took with a Boy Scout troop during my trip to South Africa in the hills surrounding Barberton. We hiked up the mountain one day, camped in a small building similar to this cabin, and rode bikes down the mountain the next day. Another very fond memory of my trip there.</li>
    <li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/22253288058/adirondack-shelter-in-oil-creek-state-park">Adirondack</a>. I slept in this very adirondack one cold and rainy weekend a few years ago, and have spent many a night in an adirondack since then. Wonderful little buildings and a great way to spend the night.</li>
    <li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/21784037353/hackney-shed-by-office-sian-in-london-england">Hackey Shed</a>. I absolutely love the idea of an open workspace such as this one and one that can easily be closed if the weather takes a turn for the worse while still allowing for a spectacular view.</li>
    <li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/16440397386/hut-in-niigata-prefecture-japan-submitted-by">Hut</a>. I took a particular liking to this &#8220;cabin&#8221;, if it could even be called that, not because the structure was anything special, but because of the spectacular mountain range it sits atop. Absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/14362535618/allandale-house-by-william-obrien">Allandale House</a>. One of the more picturesque A-frames I was able to find on Cabin Porn.</li>
    <li><a href="http://freecabinporn.com/post/9077333990/andrew-ranvilles-puumaja-project-meaning">Puumaja project</a>. The first actual tree house I found on Cabin Porn: all the others were suspended mere feet from the ground. Very impressive&#160;&#8212;&#160;not only for designing a well thought-out tree house, but also in designing an attractive one.</li>
