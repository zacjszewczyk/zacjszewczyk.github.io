    <p>"We didn&#8217;t start with any wireframes. We didnâ€™t spend anytime in brainstorming meetings. I gathered an understanding of the general goals, and went to work throwing my initial thoughts into a fake product. The end result was a prototype that, in a lot of ways, was functional.&#8221;</p>
    
    <p>Just as writers do, designers often get caught up in minor details and the implementation of processes rather than creating a final product. Whether that sticking point is a brand new text editor or a distraction-free writing environment, a wireframe or finding the perfect hue to contrast just so with another color, it is important to put these potential time sinks in perspective: while they certainly are important, we &#8220;need to concentrate on the things that the reader will notice&#8221;, to <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/02/cms-war/">quote Ben Brooks</a>, rather than the details we get caught up in all too often, the details that prevent makers from making things.</p>
