    <p>Matt Alexander of One Thirty Seven made so many interesting points I had a hard time choosing an excerpt of acceptable length for this post. I ended up settling on this one though, reflective of the tone throughout his exceptionally well-written article <em>We&#8217;re Boring, They&#8217;re Sexting</em>:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Sitting on the front porch of our quaint weblogs and latte-art-filled Instagram accounts, we&#8217;re collectively yelling at the kids playing in the street using these platforms in newer, happier, and increasingly care-free ways. These kids have been born into a world of social networking and privacy concerns are literally the last things on their minds. They&#8217;re just looking for the next best way to chat, flirt, and sext their way into each other&#8217;s bedrooms, whilst we continue to perpetuate unwritten societal rules of etiquette for Twitter and Facebook.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I can&#8217;t say enough good things about this piece&#160;&#8212;&#160;just go read it for yourself. And while you&#8217;re at it, read Josh Miller&#8217;s post referenced in the first paragraph of Matt Alexander&#8217;s article, <a href="https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3"><em>Tenth Grade Tech Trends</em></a>.</p>
