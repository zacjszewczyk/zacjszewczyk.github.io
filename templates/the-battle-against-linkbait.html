    <p>Every time I post an article, I shamelessly submit it to Hacker News in the hopes that it will get picked up and generate a significant amount of attention and traffic to my site. Somewhere in the back of my mind, every time I submit something I wrote to Hacker News I think, &#8220;Maybe this is the one, the article that will go viral, and tomorrow I&#8217;ll see John Gruber post about it and hear Dan and Haddie talk about it on The Frequency. Maybe...&#8221; But that never happens.</p>
    
    <p>Pursuant of this goal and in the face of my past &#8220;failures&#8221;, to use a bit of a strong word, I have to decide, each time I write a piece, whether to use a somewhat witty title or an overly-explanatory &#8220;linkbait&#8221; title. Each time I am faced with this decision though, the same arguments pop up in my mind: linkbait titles don&#8217;t drive the kind of traffic I want to attract. More importantly though, there&#8217;s a line that I don&#8217;t want to cross. I don&#8217;t want to be another blog clamoring for attention with a sensationalistic title on a tired topic with my nuanced opinion attached at the bottom. I want to be the blog people are excited to see new content coming from. And those kinds of blogs don&#8217;t post those kinds of titles; those bloggers battle against linkbait each and every day with each and every article, and they win.</p>
