    <p>After all the talk of <a href="http://castro.fm">Castro</a> in the last twenty-four hours since its release, and as an <a href="/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union">avid podcast listener myself</a>, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel obligated to weigh in. With articles from <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/12/castro/">John Moltz</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/castro-a-new-podcast-player-for-ios-does-two-things-well/">Cody Fink</a>, and <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/whats-new-noteworthy-world-apps-week/">Shawn Blanc</a> waiting unread in my Instapaper queue, I downloaded Castro earlier this evening expecting to burn the midnight oil to get this article out. It came as a great surprise, then, when I tried every one of Castro&#8217;s features and saw every screen within about fifteen minutes.</p>
    
    <p>Obviously designed with iOS 7 in mind, Castro came to market without any carryovers from past versions unlike the industry&#8217;s current darlings Instacast and Pocketcasts, and it shows in an aesthetically pleasing user interface. In addition to an attractive departure from the norm with respect to its design though, Castro&#8217;s youth also appears to have manifested itself in the app&#8217;s unfortunately small feature set. However, whether this limited functionality came as a result of time constraints or an overbearing philosophy dictating extreme simplicity, I cannot say for sure. Outside the <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/12/castro/">apparently remarkable ability to download episodes in the background</a>, the much more venerable ability to <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/castro-a-new-podcast-player-for-ios-does-two-things-well/">quickly search for and find podcasts</a>, and the obviously praiseworthy design though, few have anything else to say about Castro because really, there isn&#8217;t all that much to this app.</p>
