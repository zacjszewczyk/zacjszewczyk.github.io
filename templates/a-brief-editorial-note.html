    <p>Tomorrow morning at three o&#8217;clock, I will wake up three hours earlier than normal; within sixty minutes of getting out of bed, I will be on my way to the Pittsburgh International Airport; five hours after awakening&#160;&#8212;&#160;if all goes well, and weather permitting&#160;&#8212;&#160;my plane will take off bound for the Bahamian island of San Salvador where I will reside for a week as part of a geology class I enrolled in at the beginning of this semester. After several weeks of in-class study, this trip will allow my class and I to gain valuable field experience&#160;&#8212;&#160;hence the class title, &#8220;Field Investigative Geology&#8221;. Because I will go San Salvador with the express purpose of gaining field experience, due to the research center&#8217;s isolated and somewhat dated nature, and as a result of the island&#8217;s location far outside of America&#8217;s borders, I will have no way of accessing the internet from Wednesday morning until the following Friday. As a courtesy to all my readers, then, rather than simply going off-grid for an entire week without notice, I just wanted to take a moment and give you a heads-up.</p>
    
    <p>Over the past few days I have made a point of posting frequently in an effort at working my way through the queue of articles I stored in Instapaper; a few minutes ago, when I posted <a href="/blog/cabin-porn-the-book"><em>Cabin Porn, the book</em></a>, I finally emptied it so as to start with a clean slate when I get home. Shortly after returning, as I begin working my way through the inevitable backlog of news stories and articles published in my absence, I will resume my normal posting schedule. Until then though, I will enjoy the sun, the beach, and the warm air. See you next week.</p>
