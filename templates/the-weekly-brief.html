    <p>I listened to every episode of <a href="http://5by5.tv/bb">The B&#38;B Podcast</a> back when Shawn Blanc and Ben Brooks recorded it once a week up until just shy of a year ago. It came as a great disappointment, then, when it ended rather abruptly. Thankfully, I did not have to go without for long: today, Shawn announced a new weekly show to be released alongside his members-only Shawn Today podcast. I already subscribed, and I recommend you do as well: if The Weekly Brief is anything like its predecessor or reflects even a portion of its creator&#8217;s great work, it will be well worth the time.</p>
    
    <p>While on the topic, I would just like to say that it&#8217;s encouraging to see my idea of a members-only show with <a href="http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/Doing-Monetization-Well.htm#3000VisitorsaMonth">a public counterpart</a> validated by a writer I respect as much as I do Shawn Blanc. If nothing else, it shows that I&#8217;m on the right track.</p>
