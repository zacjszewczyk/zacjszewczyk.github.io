    <p>The last few years have seen a great proliferation of linkblogs, by far and away the most popular topic of which is technology and, specifically, Apple. Nevertheless the likes of John Gruber&#160;&#8212;&#160;who did not, despite many erroneous beliefs, invent either the format or topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Shawn Blanc have made their mark as entrants to a space established long before their arrival. This not only happens in the blogging space, but the podcasting industry as well where interview shows like Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s <em>Bitsplitting</em> came in and <em>sherlocked</em>&#160;&#8212;&#160;ugh&#160;&#8212;&#160;the existing space, which already had <em>plenty</em> of interview programs, with a really great show.</p>
    
    <p>Over the past three weeks much has been said about the podcasting industry. <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/09/because-podcasts-awesome/">Stephen Hacket</a>, <a href="http://unretrofied.com/blog/2013/9/26/ios-7-and-the-state-of-podcast-apps">Chris Gonzales</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/ios-7-and-podcast-apps/">Federico Viticci</a>, and <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/10/hurley-podcasting/">Myke Hurley</a> all wrote articles on this topic, but that didn&#8217;t change the fact that I had something to say, and so I contributed <a href="/blog/podcasting-state-of-the-union">my two-cents as well</a>. On one level I sherlocked<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> all those other posts, and it worked fine: many loved my article, much to my delight, because I had something interesting and unique to say. Similarly, so many loved <em>Bitsplitting</em> because Daniel Jalkut took a different approach to the tried-and-true interview show format; he, too, had something interesting and unique to contribute to the overarching narrative.</p>
    
    <p>Need I continue?</p>
    
    <p>Just because an app has cornered a particular market niche, or because that market is saturated, is by no means a valid excuse not to enter it. If we applied that logic outside the realm of apps, no one would ever write anything; no new podcasts would hit the market; no one would create another blog. But that&#8217;s oversimplifying the problem, as Marco said in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/08/sherlocking-myself"><em>Sherlocking Myself Just Fine Over Here</em></a>: everyone brings their own nuance to bear in creation. All Apple blogs are not the same; no two to-do list apps are the same. Whether through a hundred minute design decisions or the phrasing of a paragraph, every creative product is unique in some way. The challenge, then, should not be whether to enter a market or not, but how your entrant will differentiate itself from the incumbents.</p>
