    <p>Yes, the title is maybe a little too sensational for my liking; yes, &#8220;Financial Samurai&#8221; is a bit ostentatious. But you know what? Sam Dogen is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers for his terrific financial insight, and that more than makes up for any choice I may disagree with with regards to his approach to writing on the internet. Of all the sites I subscribe to and all the writers I follow, he is the only writer whose work I read regardless of topic&#160;&#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s just that good. What&#8217;s more, most of his work&#160;&#8212;&#160;in addition to providing helpful advice I have already gone on to implement as a step towards securing my financial future&#160;&#8212;&#160;can be translated and applied to the career I wish to some day have writing here. His latest article, linked above, is a great example of this valuable combination of practical advice for furthering you both in your career and your life as well, and thus something I strongly recommend you check out; and if you like it, go through his back catalog: each article is just as applicable today as it was when he first published it.</p>
