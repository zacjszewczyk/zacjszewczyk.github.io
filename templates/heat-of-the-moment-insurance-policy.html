    <p>I have spent the last two or three months occasionally hearing Aaron Mahnke and Dave Caolo talk about an app capable of completely cutting a computer off from a certain set of domains as a means to increase productivity. By making it impossible for one to get distracted, the creators of the aptly-named SelfControl reason, productivity must increase accordingly. I downloaded SelfControl Sunday night, and even in my brief experience with it so far I can attest to its effectiveness.</p>
    
    <p>After my <a href="/blog/disavow-gaming">disavowal of gaming</a> I wanted an insurance policy, something I could fall back on if boredom struck and my resolve faded. Thanks to Dave and Aaron on <a href="http://5by5.tv/homework">Homework</a> it only took me a few minutes to find, download, and open SelfControl. An open-source app aiming to remove the greatest obstacle to productive work&#160;&#8212;&#160;namely, your own resolve&#160;&#8212;&#160;SelfControl works by allowing users to define a list of sites to block and then irrevocably preventing their computers from accessing those domains for a set period of time. No amount of <a href="https://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ#q-i-did-some-stuff-with-the-terminal-that-i-read-on-a-cool-tech-site-but-it-didnt-work-what-do-i-do-now">terminal work</a> can reverse this action, nor can <a href="https://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ#q-i-deleted-the-application-will-that-do-anything">deleting the app</a> or even restarting your computer; once SelfControl&#8217;s timer has begun its countdown, the specified domains might as well not exist.</p>
    
    <p>Personally, this is exactly what I needed. Now I not only have my own resolve to lean on, but should all else fail I have no way of falling back on my unproductive ways; now I really have absolutely no excuse.</p>
