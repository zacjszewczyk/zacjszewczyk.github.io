    <p>Another unsurprisingly great article from Ben Brooks, and my favorite piece of his for quite some time. I absolutely love how he describes PandoDaily&#8217;s post: in a day and age where everyone pulls their punches for fear of offending someone by implying one thing while unconsciously omitting something else and finally ending the sentence with a period, Ben&#8217;s candid characterization is a breath of fresh air. Made all the more worthwhile by his ultimate point, I could not recommend that you go read Ben&#8217;s article and subscribe to his site more strongly. I have been <a href="/blog/an-annoyance-driven-blog-post">critical</a> of his <a href="/blog/goodbye-dropbox">views</a> in the past, but at the end of the day his site is consistently one of my favorites.</p>
