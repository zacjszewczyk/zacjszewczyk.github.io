    <p>It&#8217;s no secret that everyone has a link blog these days, and there is no short supply of <a href="http://behindcompanies.com/2012/08/the-linkblog-cancer/">opinions</a> on <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/09/linkblogs">this</a> <a href="http://alexarena.com/the-cure-to-the-linkblog-cancer/">topic</a>, arguing both for and against the widespread use of the format <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/linked_list">John Gruber introduced in 2004</a>. I am not here to parrot the words of other bloggers though, but to instead offer a solution to what Marcelo Sommers dubbed &#8220;the linkblog cancer&#8221;.</p>
    
    <p>As popularized primarily by John Gruber and to a lesser degree other writers who have adopted his proven format over the years, the linkblog strategy prescribes the title as a link to the cited article, a paragraph excerpt, and some form of commentary. There exist a few variations to this strategy, but by and large few bloggers stray from this path. In preparation for the launch of this blog I decided that while I did want to implement this format to a certain degree, I also wanted to find some way to differentiate myself from the myriad other bloggers writing this way. The result of that desire was the nuance variation on John&#8217;s posting scheme I use today. And while I admit it is a very subtle difference, I nevertheless believe it is an important one.</p>
    
    <p>When I make a linked-list post, I attempt to differentiate myself on the manner of commentary I provide. When I link to a news story my commentary is an analysis, and op-ed pieces are posted alongside my own opinions of the matter. I don&#8217;t try to be John Gruber and post with witty title and clever tagline; instead, I choose to give my readers the one thing they won&#8217;t find on The Loop or hear from Shawn Blanc, to add something to the conversation not present anywhere else on the internet: my opinion. And if that opinions turns out to be not quite as unique as I thought, well, that means I&#8217;m posting one less article today.</p>
