    <p>As I reflected upon <a href="/blog/cabin-porn"><em>Cabin Porn</em></a> and finished <a href="/blog/the-patron-saint-of-cabin-porn"><em>The Patron Saint of Cabin Porn</em></a> late last night, I thought back to something Jim Dalrymple and Merlin Mann talked about on the seventh episode of The Crossover, <a href="http://5by5.tv/crossover/7">We Met at a Tequila Bar</a>. It&#8217;s late and I can&#8217;t quite recall their exact words, but the gist of the discussion was that sometimes, you don&#8217;t always need to write a thousand words&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even a hundred, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;about something; sometimes, a simple &#8220;Yep.&#8221; will suffice. More is not always better.</p>
    
    <p>In violation of one of my personal rules, not to listen to a podcast unless I can devote my full attention to it, I was putting the finishing touches on the latest iteration of First Crack during Jim and Merlin&#8217;s discussion, so I unfortunately did not pay much attention to it at the time. As I wrote <em>The Patron Saint of Cabin Porn</em> in particular though, those were the only words I could hear. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to let the article you&#8217;re writing about speak for itself.</p>
