    <p>Earlier this morning <a href="http://nicharalambous.com/">Nic Haralambous</a> posted an article titled <a href="http://nicharalambous.com/2012/12/03/dont-read-techcrunch/"><em>Don&#8217;t Read TechCrunch</em></a>. Within four hours his article had climbed to the #1 spot on the Hacker News home page with 132 points, at which point I found it and, out of curiosity, clicked the link.</p>
    
    <p>The succinct point Nic made in <em>Don&#8217;t Read TechCrunch</em> was this: rather than spend time reading articles about fund raising, greater benefit to both him and his company came as a result of him focusing on building a profitable business. In closing Nic advised against reading TechCrunch in particular, citing it as &#8220;the biggest culprit&#8221; in a space &#8220;glorifying money raising.&#8221; While I do agree with the conclusion Nic came to in his article, his conclusion only scratches the surface of a much broader problem. The problem does not lie in wrongly glorifying a certain aspect of business, for as Nic admitted in his article, &#8220;Itâ€™s a much more complicated and in depth process in Africa and South Africa to raise funding&#8221;. Rather, the problem resides in the inherently fallacious mentality that simply reading can ever take the place of actually working towards a goal, whether that goal is developing a more profitable business or furthering your abilities as a writer.</p>
