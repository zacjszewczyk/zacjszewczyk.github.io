    <p>"The cap on WWDC tickets means it won&#8217;t go the way of SXSW - a wildly successful conference that has grown consistently since its inception. I used to go every year until one late night we looked around a huge sea of strangers and decided that we no longer knew this conference. The experience had become diluted. It had become unfamiliar, full of strangers, and unknowable.&#8221;</p>
    
    <p>For the most part, I didn&#8217;t follow the discussion surrounding WWDC ticket sales after they sold out in under two minutes. I read <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/26/the-lottery">John Siracusa&#8217;s article</a> on the topic, but for the most part stayed out of the conversation. I haven&#8217;t ever gone to WWDC, after all, nor do I plan to in the foreseeable future. From the few articles I did see, however, and based on the numerous podcasts that touched on the subject, I noticed that by far the vast majority criticized Apple for capping WWDC attendance at 5,000. Michael Lopp&#8217;s piece linked at the top of this article was the only piece of note I came across defending Apple&#8217;s decision, and easily the best.</p>
    
    <p>As a brief aside before you go on your way, before tonight I had only heard of Michael Lopp in name. Specifically, I remember this one time, very distinctly for some reason, John Gruber mentioned him and his blog on an episode of The Talk Show. After reading <em>Unknowable</em>, I took a few minutes to check out his site. Ten minutes later I finished adding Rands in Repose to my RSS reader; I was very impressed. Over the next half hour I jumped between this article and <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/08/28/youre_not_listening.html"><em>You&#8217;re Not Listening</em></a>, an article from last year about verbal communication and all its curious little nuances. It was a very interesting read and a representative sample of the type and quality of article Michael Lopp writes. As I suggested at the end of <a href="/blog/tumblr-plus-yahoo"><em>Tumblr. + Yahoo! = !!</em></a>, if you are unfamiliar with his work, go check it out.</p>
