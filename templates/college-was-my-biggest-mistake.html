    <p>"No one could tell me why I was wasting my creative energy, focus, and life on something I didn’t want to do. Classes didn’t hold my attention- I could teach myself more in an afternoon than I would learn in a 10-week class. My classes appealed to the lowest-common denominator. The bottom of the barrel.&#8221;</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, the situation Steve Corona describes in his insightful piece <a href="http://stevecorona.com/college-was-my-biggest-mistake/"><em>College was my biggest mistake</em></a> is not exclusive to college, but a never-ending battle waged throughout the lives of countless students across the world regardless of age or location, especially in American. Even as a homeschooler I encounter this difficulty every single day in every one of my classes. Let me say it again in the hopes of reinforcing this crucial point: this situation, the tendency for classes to appeal to the lowest common denominator, as Steve put it, is not exclusive to colleges, but an all-too common experience in today&#8217;s educational construct. And while there is some hope for educational reform, we must ask the question, &#8220;Will it be too late?" Towards the end of his piece Steve explained that even today fewer companies look at college credentials, instead preferring the real-world experience formalized learning does such a good job of preventing, the real-world experience people like Steve opt for at the expense of the increasingly irrelevant college degree.</p>
