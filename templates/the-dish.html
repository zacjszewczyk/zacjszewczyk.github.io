    <p>In the wee hours of this morning Andrew Sullivan and his team completed The Dish&#8217;s migration from The Daily Beast, transitioning fully to a reader-supported model. In an article posted to The Verge a few hours later titled <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/4/3949834/andrew-sullivan-the-dish-experiment-goes-live"><em>Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s grand experiment in reader-supported online journalism is now live</em></a>, Jeff Blagdon describes the challenges facing The Dish as one of the first major websites to become reader-supported:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Prominent political blogger Andrew Sullivan’s site The Dish is now up and running at its new user-funded home. So far, the ad-free experiment appears to be a success, with Sullivan pulling in $511,000 in revenue over the five weeks that passed since the project was announced — half of the $1 million the writer says he needs to run the site for a year.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jeff went on to question the plausibility of The Dish reaching its funding goal in the coming weeks, skeptical of whether or not it was possible. But Andrew has a plan, detailed in The Verge&#8217;s piece <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/2/3827960/andrew-sullivan-dish-blog-leaving-daily-beast-for-reader-subscription-model"><em>Andrew Sullivan leaving The Daily Beast for ad-free, reader-supported blog</em></a> as well as on The Dish&#8217;s own site in <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/02/04/migration-explained/"><em>Migration Explained</em></a>:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Starting Monday morning, some posts will have a blue &#8216;Read On&#8217; button. If you click that button, the post will expand for continued reading, just as in the past. If you’re a subscriber, you will always be able to access all read-on material. If you are a non-subscriber, you will be limited to seven read-on clicks during a 30-day period. If you open a read-on post in a new window, that will also count against the read-on meter. If non-subscribers max out the read-on meter, all content above a read-on will still be free and accessible – but the deeper dish won’t be.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Striking the delicate balance between a full-on paywall and leaving their content open for anyone to read, The Dish&#8217;s segregation strategy fills me with hope for other major websites forsaking ads in place of reader contributions in one form or another. He continues:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Incoming links from other blogs and websites will never, ever count toward the meter; other bloggers need not fear that their readers won’t be able to see content they link to. I want to personally soothe Dan Savage’s concern on this point.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>While I foresee this becoming a problem, I applaud The Dish&#8217;s foresight to create their paywall strategy with bloggers in mind. All in all The Dish has a very interesting plan, one that I hope to see succeed in the coming months.</p>
