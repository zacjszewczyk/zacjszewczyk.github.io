    <p>Right on the heels of its quarterly earnings call, after an 8% drop in price, Apple shelled out $14,000,000,000 in continuation the buyback program it started <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/19Apple-Announces-Plans-to-Initiate-Dividend-and-Share-Repurchase-Program.html">in 2012</a>. Contrary to 9to5mac&#8217;s report, I have a hard time believing Tim Cook was at all surprised by this drop; rather, a much more likely scenario would have found him counting on such a devaluation regardless of what he said, did, or otherwise announced during the earnings call. What better time to conduct a large buyback program than at nearly 10% off? If anything, it may have surprised him that it did not fall farther. <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/02/06/apple-buys-back-14-billion-in-stock/">As Jim Dalrymple said</a>, &#8220;Apple is being very strategic with every move it makes.&#8221; I completely agree.</p>
