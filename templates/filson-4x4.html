    <p>I love overachievers in the world of cars much more than in person, hence my unbridled enthusiasm when <a href="/blog/superhero-vehicles">I happened across</a> Mercedes&#8217; six-wheeled monster the G63 AMG and Ghe-O&#8217;s indomitable Rescue. Something about these <em>trucks</em>, for their rugged ability to tackle literally any terrain imaginable truly epitomizes the colloquial definition of the term<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, awakens a visceral desire to pack my backpack and spend a long weekend trekking through uninhabited back country with nothing but my thoughts to keep my company; they ignite within me a base midwestern American desire to go outside and spend time in nature. Unsurprisingly, then, Filson&#8217;s Jeep 4x4 was no exception. My only hesitation in pushing its limits on a narrow mountain trail would be that I tarnish its carefully crafted exterior and spoil the bespoke interior; once I got past that though, I have no doubt it could handle anything I decided to throw at it.</p>
    
    <p>I don&#8217;t mean to go on a rant, but as a brief aside I do not understand the appeal of such small trucks. I can see the place of cars, vans, SUVs, and F-150-esq trucks in the jobs consumers hire vehicles to do, but when it comes to these small &#8220;trucks&#8221; I am at a loss. Granted, their perpetuated existence indicates continued demand for such a form factor, but I can&#8217;t for the life of my understand its appeal. Perhaps this is the naivety of youth and machismo of a nineteen-year-old speaking, but if I had the need for a flat bed and an additional four miles to each gallon without the bulk of an F-150 or above&#160;&#8212;&#160;the only reasons I could see someone purchasing one of these vehicles&#160;&#8212;&#160;I would swallow my second and third criteria and buy a Ford F-series anyways.</p>
