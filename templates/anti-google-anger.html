    <p>Marco Arment in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/21/thursday-sandwich"><em>Your favorite Thursday sandwich</em></a>, where he argued against Om Malik&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">decision not to use Google Keep</a>:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In this business, you can&#8217;t count on anything having longevity. To avoid new services that are likely to get shut down within a few years, you&#8217;d have to avoid every new tech product. Products and services lasting more than a few years are the exception, not the rule.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And while I feel he does make a valid point, Marco overlooked a key difference between Google and every new tech product: Google has done this in the past and will do it again: this is not the first time they have closed the doors on a product we love, nor will it be the last. That&#8217;s the difference here. That&#8217;s the problem. Unfortunately though, Marco is right: everyone will continue to use Google&#8217;s products despite this uncertainty. Sure, a few may take a principled stand like Om Malik did, but at the end of the day, it won&#8217;t matter.</p>
