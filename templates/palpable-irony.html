    <p>Merlin Mann once said that when he was seventeen years old, he felt his sole job in the world was to expose all hypocrisy. At the time, at seventeen myself, I laughed; however, a couple of years later the same thing has become true of myself: very few things annoy me as much as hypocrisy these days, and the very closely-related phenomenon of the double standard drives me insane. Today, in a fantastically ironic turn of events that came to my attention through <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2014/04/08/okcupid-ceo-once-donated-to-anti-gay-politician/">an article on SFGate</a>, <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2014/04/06/the-hypocrisy-of-sam-yagan-okcupid/">UnCrunched discovered that OkCupid&#8217;s CEO, Sam Yagan&#160;&#8212;&#160;one of the most vocal critics of Brendan Eich&#160;&#8212;&#160;once supported a congressman known for his huge opposition of anything to do with homosexuals</a>. The same man who played such a pivotal role in the ruin of Brendan Eich&#8217;s career, claiming that his support of California&#8217;s Proposition 8 nearly a decade ago made him an abhorrent individual unfit to lead Mozilla, supported a congressional candidate that <em>goes even farther than Proposition 8 did</em>. Absolutely incredible.</p>
    
    <p>After the debacle with Brendan Eich, I hope to see the petitioning for Yagan&#8217;s removal as OkCupid&#8217;s CEO within the next twenty-four hours. <a href="/blog/discrimination-comes-full-circle">I did not support Eich&#8217;s removal from Mozilla in the first place</a>, but now that his career has gone down the tubes thanks in large part to Sam Yagan&#8217;s actions, anything less than the same outcome would be an incredibly inappropriate double standard of judgment. The public has decided that political contributions made even a decade ago can come back to haunt the donors, as evidenced by Eich&#8217;s removal as Mozilla&#8217;s CEO after just eleven days; it&#8217;s time to apply that precedent to Sam Yagan as well.</p>
