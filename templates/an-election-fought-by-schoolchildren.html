    <p>Stories like this one from Craig Grannell remind me why I have been so reticent to enter the political landscape in any meaningful capacity up until now, a hesitancy <a href="/blog/the-net-neutrality-wake-up-call">I outlined when linking to Ben Thompson&#8217;s recent piece</a> in which he called for greater political involvement for those in the technical professions. Everyone promises peace and to bring the soldiers home, but that will never happen: wars will forever wage on, and someone will always need stopped. The key difference between Craig&#8217;s story and reality, though, is not the tactics or actions of the system&#8217;s participants, but rather the end result when they invariably and inevitably fail to fulfill their promises: whereas his classmates held him and his cohorts accountable on the schoolyard, modern-day citizens&#160;&#8212;&#160;and Americans in particular, it seems&#160;&#8212;&#160;have no interest in holding anyone accountable for the promises on which they renege.</p>
