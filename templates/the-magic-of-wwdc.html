    <p>As I catch up on missed articles, I came across this noteworthy one from Adam Haworth&#8217;s <a href="/blog/change-is-inevitable">previously-mentioned</a> Sansink, where he talks about fanboyism and WWDC. Worth reading, I believe, especially in the wake of Monday&#8217;s spectacular keynote address, because I think his point of view mirrors that of all but the relatively small sect who get genuinely enthused around this time each year: for most of the computer-using world, WWDC is an over-hyped and ultimately disappointing event specifically for overzealous hipsters with too much time and money on their hands. In light of the nature and magnitude of Apple&#8217;s latest announcements, however, I would be curious to know whether he&#160;&#8212;&#160;and all those who hold this and similar opinions&#160;&#8212;&#160;now feel at all different, for what we saw on that Monday afternoon truly was groundbreaking, and I firmly believe that one does not have to be an Apple fanboy&#160;&#8212;&#160;or even involved in the ecosystem, for that matter&#160;&#8212;&#160;to appreciate these impressive announcements; WWDC truly was worth the excitement. It may only be technology, but it will absolutely change the world.</p>
