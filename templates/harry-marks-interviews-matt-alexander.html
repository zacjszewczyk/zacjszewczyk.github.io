    <p>When I started writing <a href="/blog/harry-marks-interviews-matt-alexander-on-need"><em>Need, Fashion, and Matt Alexander</em></a> I began with the title &#8220;Harry Marks Interviews Matt Alexander on Need&#8221;. Those curious can look to the post&#8217;s URL for confirmation, which still reads as described despite the fact that I changed its title. I set out with such a headline intending to make a short congratulatory post linking to Harry Marks&#8217; article <a href="http://www.curiousrat.com/interview-with-needs-matt-alexander"><em>Interview with Matt Alexander of Need</em></a><em>;</em> however, ambition got the better of me and I ended up writing something I feel quite proud of as one of my better think pieces in a while. Those original motifs I pushed to the wayside still clamored for attention though, attention that I will grant them in this follow-up piece.</p>
    
    <p>At the onset I began the article that evolved into <em>Need, Fashion, and Matt Alexander</em> as not just a link post, but&#160;&#8212;&#160;more importantly, in my mind&#160;&#8212;&#160;a commentary regarding Harry Marks&#8217; interesting presentation of his interview I found very reminiscent of the best traits print publications had to offer. Namely, in stark contrast to the all-too common laundry list of questions posed and then answered in rapid and brief succession characteristic of interviews posted online, Harry peppered just five throughout his nearly 1700-word article. This great question-to-elaboration ratio did two wonderful things: first, it forced Harry to put a lot of forethought into his queries; with just five available, he was forced to&#160;&#8212;&#160;and did so splendidly&#160;&#8212;&#160;pose only the most pertinent and interesting questions. Equally important, this also allowed Matt Alexander to expound upon his answers in enough detail that I seldom wished for more information. Combined these two aspects lent themselves to a much more fulfilling interview than I see most internet publications squeeze out these days.</p>
    
    <p>As much as I may wish it were so, I did not finish <em>Interview with Matt Alexander of Need</em> and sit back to reflect upon Harry&#8217;s lack of incessant interrogation and an absence of disappointingly brief quips on Matt&#8217;s part. Rather, I scrolled back through the article looking at Harry&#8217;s unique presentation of that content. Complete with well-placed and relevant section headers that served the dual purpose of presenting Harry&#8217;s questions and defining the following paragraphs&#8217; topic interspersed with strategically placed germane and interesting excerpts, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry&#8217;s take on the tried and true interview model.</p>
