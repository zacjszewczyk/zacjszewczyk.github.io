    <p>Coming back from <a href="/blog/this-week-without-podcasts-83014">a week without podcasts</a>, I have two great episodes to showcase this time around. Here&#8217;s to fantastic podcasts, then, and their continued, well-deserved success.</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-34-my-code-s-nicer-than-your-code">Pragmatic Episode 34: My Code&#8217;s Nicer than Your Code</a>. John Chidgey has Guy English on to talk about a topic with a much longer shelf life than coding itself: conventions and best practices. Although I don&#8217;t agree with every philosophy John put forth here, I recognize that such practices are a matter of intense personal preference. Just because I believe my way to be better than his does not necessarily mean that it is.</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/184">Back to Work Episode 184: Days of Bathrooms Past</a>. Get through what some will consider a difficult trial, and others a humorous anecdote, and Dan and Merlin have some fascinating insights to share with regards to expertise and momentum. This most definitely is what the listeners tune in for.</p>
    
    <p>Until next week, when I will hopefully have had more time to catch up on all the wonderful shows I keep missing. Here&#8217;s to hoping, as well.</p>
