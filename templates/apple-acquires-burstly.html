    <p>Apple acquired another company&#160;&#8212;&#160;great, wonderful; the most interesting news I saw after this announcement, however, came from Federico Viticci when he highlighted a recent idea MG Siegler put forth before Christmas in suggesting a Beta App Store. From Federico&#8217;s article:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>> &#8220;On a related rumor note, the Burstly acquisition may also indicate Apple&#8217;s intention to launch a &#8216;beta App Store&#8217; service for developers to test apps publicly with subsets of users in specific regions or demographics. The idea was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/16/beta-app-store/">first suggested by MG Siegler</a> in December 2013 and <a href="https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/436934869818425344">brought up</a> again <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/436942086932140032">today</a> following the acquisition news.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Very interesting. If you, like me before coming across it by way of Federico&#8217;s article, have not read MG&#8217;s piece, I encourage you to do so: he makes a strong case for this idea. It still needs some work and presents a number of potential issues&#160;&#8212;&#160;allowing anyone access to this testing ground seems problematic, to say the least; there&#8217;s a very good reason betas of Apple&#8217;s operating systems and apps are restricted to those with a developer account&#160;&#8212;&#160;but these challenges are by no means insurmountable. And MG is right: it&#8217;s high-time Apple gave its developers these capabilities.</p>
