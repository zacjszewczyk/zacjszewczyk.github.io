    <p>"Ive come to a point in my life where I can afford nice computers, good scotch and a great view of the leaves changing colors across the hills and bluffs of Southeastern Minnesota. My wife and I can afford to take good care of our pets, and I can afford to take better care of myself. I honestly never would have guessed Id get to this point.&#8221;</p>
    
    <p>This article by Brett Terpstra has already made its rounds on many of the popular blogs, and for good reason, but I just couldn&#8217;t resist linking it as well.</p>
    
    <p>Someday I hope to reach a similar place as Brett. Maybe without the life-threatening experiences along the way, but it is those that make us the people we are today.</p>
