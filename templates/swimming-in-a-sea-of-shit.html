    <p>"This has nothing to do with politics, or gender. I know women who have been threated physically because of their thoughts on real-time strategy games. I knew men who had their spouses and children threatened, or had racial or sexual harassment thrown their way, because of review scores. This isn&#8217;t new. This isn&#8217;t rare. And it&#8217;s not something anyone can easily ignore, or something they should expected to endure silently and gracefully.&#8221; - Ben Kuchera for Penny Arcade in <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/swimming-in-a-sea-of-shit-the-internets-war-against-creatives">Swimming in a sea of shit</a></p>
    
    <p>A few weeks ago a retired Navy friend of mine said something that struck me hard at the time, but particularly forcefully as I sat digesting the article cited above from Penny Arcade: &#8220;Guys don&#8217;t beat their wives because of PTSD; it&#8217;s a real thing, I promise you that, but that isn&#8217;t why they beat them. They beat their wives because they&#8217;re low-life scumbags.&#8221; Addendum mine: but they still blame PTSD.</p>
    
    <p>I won&#8217;t go so far as to compare mental abuse incurred on the internet to physical abuse in the home, but I will pose this question: how is the Twitter user threatening to commit heinous acts justifying his&#160;&#8212;&#160;or her, let me be explicitly gender-normative here lest I incur the extremists&#8217;s rage&#160;&#8212;&#160;actions with the modification of <em>a gun</em> in <em>a game</em> any different than the scumbag who goes home and knocks his wife around in the evenings? Sure, one is <em>merely</em> threatening while the other actually injures, but if that&#8217;s the only differentiation you can make, well, that right there is the problem itself.</p>
