    <p>I realize in my last two articles, <a href="/blog/instapaper-5"><em>Instapaper 5</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in which I made a number of proposals for Instapaper 5&#160;&#8212;&#160;and <a href="/blog/betaworks-releases-instapaper-5"><em>Betaworks Releases Instapaper 5</em></a>&#160;&#8212;&#160;in which I conveyed my mostly positive feelings on the new release&#160;&#8212;&#160;I likely appeared very critical of Betaworks and their continued work on Instapaper. This is not the case: while I do feel a better launch strategy entailing a service-wide design overhaul and one in which they added a larger set of new features to Instapaper would have greatly helped the platform, I am not of the opinion that Betaworks did not improve the app in Instapaper 5; the impressive new InstaRank feature is a prime example of this.</p>
    
    <p>That said though, I cannot help but feel that this feature, too, would have benefited from some additional development time. I may&#160;&#8212;&#160;and the blog post linked earlier confirms this suspicion&#160;&#8212;&#160;be an outlier in that I prefer to keep my Instapaper queue small, in the four to eight article range, and read in chronological order. This is a roundabout way to say that I will find little use in Instapaper&#8217;s new Popularity sorting algorithm, but not that I could not at some point in the future: a section similar to The Feature&#160;&#8212;&#160;available under &#8220;Browse&#8221; on the iPhone&#160;&#8212;&#160;populated with articles ranked using the InstaRank algorithm through which I could find and save articles to my queue for consumption at a later date would be very useful indeed.</p>
