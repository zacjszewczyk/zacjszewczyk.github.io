    <p>Had I picked one paragraph or sentence as a pull quote from Ben Thompson&#8217;s <em>Chromebooks and the Cost of Complexity</em>, I would have done the rest of his article a great disservice by holding one fascinating line above another equally excellent passage. Having read StratÄ“chery for a few months now, I can honestly say that out of all his articles, I consider this one by far and away his best.</p>
    
    <p>Also of interest, Ben posted a followup piece earlier today titled <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/the-best-analogy-for-chromebooks-are-ipads/"><em>The Best Analogy for Chromebooks are iPads</em></a>, where he explained the use case of a Chromebook and its similarity to that of an iPad. When I can justify another large technology expenditure, I will have to do some serious work to talk myself out of a Chromebook after these two articles.</p>
