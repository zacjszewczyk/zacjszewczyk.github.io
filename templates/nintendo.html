    <p>Moisés writing about the three lingering problems plaguing Nintendo these days, and what he believes are the best solutions to those issues. In the last point under problem #2, &#8220;Nintendo isn&#8217;t simple anymore&#8221;, Moisés introduces a concept he discussed with Horace on the eighty-third episode of The Critical Path, <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/83"><em>The Analyst Taxonomy</em></a>: the idea of a <a href="/blog/the-8-bit-nintendo-phone">Nintendo phone</a>.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If Nintendo is actually serious about staying in hardware, they should be developing a phone. That the most profitable gaming platform (mobile phones) completely lacks Nintendo software is bizarre.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>&#8220;Their tablet platform already exists, and is attached to their set-top box. The same VirtualConsole-scale games could run on a phone with physical gameplay buttons, just as they do on the Wii U GamePad and the 3DS. They already make a mobile-scale OS, and have been doing so for years. Their classic games just don’t work on phones that have no physical controls. If anyone can truly break through with a smart gamerphone, it would be Nintendo, but they show no interest whatsoever in this space.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Throughout the article Moisés drew a number of parallels between Nintendo and Apple, culminating with the suggestion that Nintendo come out and an offering not unlike the Apple TV to close the piece. As I said in <a href="/blog/the-8-bit-nintendo-phone"><em>The 8-Bit Nintendo Phone</em></a>, such a comparison is not only apt but also very appropriate given the similarities between the two. I can only hope that those similarities extend beyond Nintendo&#8217;s aptitude for hardware and software creation to the ability to disrupt existing markets with revolutionary new products.</p>
