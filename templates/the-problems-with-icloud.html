    <p>As a born PC user I rarely interact with iCloud on my main computer. Even on my iOS devices I rarely use iCloud, where, given the choice, I will choose Dropbox or some other method to sync documents and settings across devices. The most recent episode of Back to Work, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/103"><em>Lotta Little Knives</em></a>, brought the issue to a head in my mind, and Ben Brooks&#8217;s less recent article <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/01/archiving-cloud/"><em>Archived Data, in the Cloud</em></a>, in which he proposed an interesting solution to the topic at hand, prompted me to write this piece.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;How does a great cloud storage system work using the Fusion Drive model? Just swap &#8216;SSD&#8217; with &#8216;your local device&#8217; and &#8216;HDD&#8217; with &#8216;cloud'. The OS intelligently decides which files it should keep locally — everything else gets off-loaded to the cloud.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The solution, however, fails to solve the main problems with iCloud: that it tries to be everything to everyone, and that, even by Apple&#8217;s we&#8217;ll-make-it-work-don&#8217;t-worry-how standards, iCloud is an exceptionally closed system. Combined, these two aspects have led to inconsistent syncing and, most importantly, a profound feeling of doubt. In <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/statuses/126685517445206018c">a tweet from 2011</a>, Merlin Mann described Dropbox&#8217;s syncing experience, saying, &#8220;When I hit a button and &#8216;Send to Dropbox,' I for damn sure know where it is…it&#8217;s EVERYWHERE—it&#8217;s never NOT everywhere.&#8221; Conversely, when I make a change to an application relying on iCloud as a back end, I don&#8217;t know where it is&#160;&#8212;&#160;whether that &#8220;it&#8221; is a file or a setting. That&#8217;s the problem with iCloud: it&#8217;s sometimes in some places. And that&#8217;s an inconsistency I, and many other people, cannot afford.</p>
