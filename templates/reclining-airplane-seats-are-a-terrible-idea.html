    <p>"'We paid for these goddamn seats, and we&#8217;ll recline them if we want to.' So then everyone was angry: I was angry because I had no room, and she was angry because I passive-aggressively kicked her seat once every 15 minutesâ€”often enough to be annoying, but not often enough to definitely be on purpose.&#8221;</p>
    
    <p>Funny how such a little thing could become such a bone of contention to so many people. Having spent days in airports and on numerous long flights though, I can certainly see where Dan Kois is coming from: there are few things more annoying during a flight than having what little personal space you are allotted cut down to a fraction by the person in front of you.</p>
