<p>> &#8220;All of this leads to the question; is there any company more successful at controlling the public narrative than Amazon? Nothing it cares about ever leaks. Almost all of the press coverage, even the negative stories, runs to a script that Bezos could have written&#160;&#8212;&#160;'We do amazing things to get low prices to customers&#8217; and &#8216;it&#8217;s incredibly hard to compete with us'. Of course, both of those things may well be true.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Everyone loves to praise Apple as the most interesting company in existence, building the greatest products available, showcased with <a href="/blog/misunderstood">the best marketing</a> in the business. Conversely, everyone loves to hate Amazon: they never do anything interesting and consistently &#8220;fail&#8221; to turn a profit; their products consistently fall far short of even the most reasonable expectations; and the company operates essentially as a black box. I find it incredibly interesting, then, when a writer goes to bat for Amazon. The companies are not all that different, after all.</p>
