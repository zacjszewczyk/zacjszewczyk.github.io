    <p>Leading up to <a href="https://twitter.com/linusedwards">Linus Edwards&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://vintagezen.com/zen/2014/1/8/the-hard-way">promise</a> of an article after he, I, and a number of others had an incredibly long conversation about growing one&#8217;s readership and attracting attention on Twitter yesterday, I had been toying with the idea of writing one myself. However, when he decided to put his own post together, I chose to forgo mine until he published his. As it turns out, I did the right thing: reading <em>The Hard Way</em> earlier this afternoon, it was as if I had written it myself. Linus covered all the points I would have and even told a story that could have just as easily fit my experience working to drive traffic towards my work. All in all, an excellent retrospective and a great starting point for anyone thinking of launching their own website.</p>
