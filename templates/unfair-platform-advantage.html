    <p>I devoted <a href="/blog/the-september-iphone-launch">my last post</a> to discussing Ina Fried&#8217;s prediction of a September 10th iPhone launch date, forgoing my thoughts on the article itself and its rise to popularity over the last twenty-four hours. From my opening paragraph:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Earlier this morning, as I scrolled through my RSS reader, I came across a number of articles mentioning an unassuming and altogether unremarkable <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130810/circle-sept-10-on-your-calendar-for-apples-big-iphone-event/">AllThingsD piece by Ina Fried</a>. Despite its lukewarm tone, the prediction of a September iPhone launch event ran the gamut of popular tech sites and garnered a great deal of attention even though it said nothing surprising or even particularly interesting at this point.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Now, I intend to expand upon that overarching sentiment of disappointment.</p>
    
    <p>As near as I can tell, it appears the hullabaloo that rose up around Ina&#8217;s article stemmed from her information purportedly coming from a source within the company, or so her article seemed to imply. That, and the fact that the notable(?) site AllThingsD published the rumor.</p>
    
    <p>And I consider that fundamentally wrong. As I said in <em>The September iPhone Launch</em>'s opening paragraph cited above, Ina neither made any surprising nor interesting observations&#160;&#8212;&#160;let alone predictions&#160;&#8212;&#160;as to the future with the minor exception of a concrete launch date. But as I demonstrated later on in my article, even deducing that date proved of little difficulty; no harder than tacking on "...sources told AllThingsD&#8221; anyways. But yet GigaOM, TechCrunch, Macstories, and other well-known internet publications picked it up, branded it with their stamp of approval, and passed it along. It&#8217;s disappointing, really: both the article itself and the fact that so many deemed it worthy to pass along in such high regard.</p>
