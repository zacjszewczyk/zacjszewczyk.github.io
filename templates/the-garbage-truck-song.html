    <p>Speaking of great podcasts, Ben Thompson and James Allworth just started a new show called <a href="http://exponent.fm"><em>Exponent</em></a>. In their first episode, released just a few days ago on Thursday, the pair took an interesting look at disruption theory, the innovator&#8217;s dilemma, and culture as those aspects pertain to Microsoft and Apple&#8217;s past and present situation as well influence their future directions. Rather than spending the majority of their time discussing Apple though, as many of today&#8217;s tech podcast hosts are want to do, Ben and James had one of the most level-headed, intelligent, and engaging discussions on Microsoft I have heard since the company became a headline-worthy topic once again with the elevation of Satya Nadella to CEO. Any show with this impressive roster would be worth taking note of, but these two outdid themselves here: if their future episodes are anywhere near as good as this one, Exponent is going to grow into quite the remarkable show.</p>
