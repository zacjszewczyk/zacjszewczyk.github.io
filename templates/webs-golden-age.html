    <p>I somehow managed to forget to post this article after I wrote it, so here it finally is:</p>

    <p>A blast from the past in an article written three years ago today, on January 26, 2010, by Josh Bernoff:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We call this new world the Splinternet (with a nod to Doc Searls and Rich Tehrani, who used the term before us with a somewhat different meaning). It will splinter the Web as a unified system. The golden age has lasted 15 years. Like all golden ages, it lasted so long we thought it would last forever. But the end is in sight.&#8221;</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how the increasingly diverse computing market was viewed even just a few years ago, in a time when accidentally finding this article on my computer and piecing together this post between my phone and iPad would have been impossible.</p>
