    <p>From the author of <a href="http://bloglivingthedream.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/so-simple/">so simple</a>, the article I referenced in <a href="/blog/so-simple">my last post</a>, speaking to her attempt at achieving a &#8220;simpler, greener, cleaner, freer life":</p>
    
    <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I still feel very guilty about small habits which I canâ€™t shake, one of which is my Nespresso coffee machine with its dependency on capsules bought in a store which makes my skin crawl with its ostentatiousness, a cathedral to consumerism.  But today while stocking up my habit, I found out that I can recycle the capsules at the store and the aluminium will be melted down.&#8221;</p>

    <p>As I looked back on this short post consisting merely of the two paragraphs above, prepared to save it for publication tomorrow morning, I couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling that it lacked something. There was, ironically, definitely something missing from this post about simplifying one&#8217;s life. And then it came to me: a few weeks ago during my cabin porn binge I posted an article called <a href="/blog/something-to-it"><em>Something to it</em></a>. After spending two days consuming every available resource so much as mentioning cabins or simplified living, I made an observation that maybe there was something to this simple lifestyle after all, something more than a cabin deep within the woods and a less demanding lifestyle&#160;&#8212;&#160;something more than meets the eye. This article from the anonymous writer at Living the Dream rekindled that spark, igniting the curiosity that prompted me to ask the question, &#8220;is there something more to this simplicity?"</p>
