    <p>A few days ago Stefan Constantinescu of <a href="http://tabdump.com/">Tab Dump</a> wrote an article titled <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/1/22/making-some-bets"><em>Making Some Bets</em></a>, where he announced his decision to go fully independent and rely on his writing to support himself. The latest in <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/01/12/bretts-new-adventures-and-how-you-can-help/">a</a> string <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/">of</a> similar resolutions, his decision gained a bit of attention, through which I came across <a href="http://tabdump.com/blog/2014/2/4/february-04-57-tabs"><em>February 04: 57 tabs</em></a> earlier this morning. The broad range of topics he covers makes for very interesting reading and highlights great articles I would never have found otherwise, but I could get that from any old news reader. Rather, it is the unique format and accompanying succinct summarizations that I find so compelling about Stefan&#8217;s new daily venture, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt that he includes enough articles to keep me set for a day or two, at least, with each installment. I really like this new thing Stefan decided to do, and I think you will too. Definitely go check it out.</p>
