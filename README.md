First Crack - A simple static blogging engine written in Python
===============================================================

Given a directory of plain text files formatted in Markdown, First Crack will generate a static website of over a thousand pages in less than two seconds.

## Prerequisites
### Python 2.*

I started this project in 2011, with Python 2. You will need Python 2.* to use my blogging engine. I plan to port it to Python 3 soon. Use with versions other than 2.* at your own risk.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zacjszewczyk/FirstCrack.git
$ cd FirstCrack
```

## Usage

```
$ chmod 755 ./blog.py
$ ./blog.py
```

```
$ vi ./EDITME
$ ./blog.py
```

## Background and Motivation

I started this project in 2011. After trying many content management systems, I decided to roll my own. After a few months of work, I began running my website on something I called First Crack.
